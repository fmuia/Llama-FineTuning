\section{Scalar and tensor power spectra}




Demonstrate how to compute the scalar and tensor power spectrum in the (N-A) regime. The problem is that we cannot relate this to observables, if the (V) regime is reached before the end of inflation, since then we don't know the overall e-fold we are at. Possible way out: choose parameters such that this regime is not reached before the end of inflation. \textit{Maybe better way out: in this section only, discuss SU(2)xU(1) model. I.e.\ the background evolution is as in standard abelian axion inflation (since we have demonstrated that the non-abelian contribution is subdominant for equal coupling), check here if there are relevant additional contributions to the power spectra (could be, due to linear contributions in stress-energy tensor).}
\begin{itemize}
\item scalar power spectrum: determined by $\delta \phi$ fluctuations computed above.
 \item Present general calculation of stochastic gravitational wave background produced from the enhanced gauge field modes.
 \item calculate stress energy tensor (see stress-energy tensor.pdf). 
 \item calculate tensor power spectrum. not linear contributions.
 \item equivalently: include eom for $\gamma_{ij}$ in coupled ODE system
 \item other pheno consequences?
\end{itemize}
