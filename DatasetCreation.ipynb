We summarize current methods for construction and analysis of vacua with stabilized moduli, and we describe applications to cosmology and particle physics. This is a contribution to the Handbook on Quantum Gravity.  The fundamental physical laws that govern our Universe must describe gravity and quantum mechanics. To discover the laws of quantum gravity, we cannot entirely rely on terrestrial experiments, or even on cosmological observations: the energies of observable processes are far too low to give a complete picture, in contrast to the way that collider experiments eventually revealed the Standard Model of particle physics. We may hope for some guidance from experiment, but theorists will have to provide a framework. String theory is such a framework: it is a theory of quantum gravity through which we can take a constructive approach to exploring possible laws of quantum gravity in our Universe. The first obstacle is that the world we observe at low energies is four-dimensional, while the best-understood solutions of string theory are ten-dimensional. Kaluza-Klein theory \\cite{Kaluza:1921tu,Klein:1926tv}, now more than a century old, provides a way to bridge this gap. If the extra dimensions correspond to a six-dimensional compact space that is smaller than the reach of any experimental probe then only three spatial dimensions will be seen. However, the size and shape of the extra dimensions are dynamical: they are parameterized by the expectation values of scalar fields known as moduli. Unless the moduli have large masses, they mediate long-range forces that are not observed in our world. Thus, a central problem of Kaluza-Klein theories is to provide a dynamical explanation for the requisite size of the extra dimensions, and to ensure that the moduli masses are consistent with experiment.</th>\n",

       "      <th rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\">Thus, vacuum solutions of string theory are furnished by Ricci-flat six-manifolds. Consider a six-manifold $X_6$ with K\"ahler metric $g_{mn}$, and define the Riemannian holonomy group $\\text{Hol}(g)$. If $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3) \\subset SO(6)$, then $g$ is Ricci-flat, and we call $X_6$ a Calabi-Yau threefold. It follows that $X_6$ having holonomy $SU(3)$ is a sufficient condition for a vacuum solution of string theory in compactification on $X_6$. One striking property of such solutions is that the compactification preserves some of the supersymmetry found in the ten-dimensional theory. We are aware of no argument that $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3)$ is a necessary condition for Ricci-flatness, but every example of a compact Ricci-flat six-manifold constructed to date has holonomy contained in $SU(3)$ (see e.g.~\\cite{Acharya:2019mcu}). Even so, one should bear in mind the possibility that there may exist compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds with holonomy $SO(6)$ that furnish non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory. By necessity we will restrict our discussion to the known examples of vacuum solutions, i.e.~to Calabi-Yau threefolds. We stress, however, that the presence of supersymmetry in this context is not a consequence of an attempt to explain hierarchies in particle physics: it is instead a powerful aid to theoretical control. Specifically, the superstring is our starting point because superstring theories are vastly better-understood than non-supersymmetric string theories, and Calabi-Yau compactifications --- which preserve some supersymmetry at the compactification scale, though this may be broken to nothing at lower energies --- are our geometric focus because they are the only compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds known at the time of this writing.</th>\n",

       "Liam McAllister$^{a}$ and Fernando Quevedo$^{b}$ 30   We give an overview of moduli stabilization in compactifications of string theory. We summarize current methods for construction and analysis of vacua with stabilized moduli, and we describe applications to cosmology and particle physics. This is a contribution to the Handbook on Quantum Gravity.  The fundamental physical laws that govern our Universe must describe gravity and quantum mechanics. To discover the laws of quantum gravity, we cannot entirely rely on terrestrial experiments, or even on cosmological observations: the energies of observable processes are far too low to give a complete picture, in contrast to the way that collider experiments eventually revealed the Standard Model of particle physics. We may hope for some guidance from experiment, but theorists will have to provide a framework. String theory is such a framework: it is a theory of quantum gravity through which we can take a constructive approach to exploring possible laws of quantum gravity in our Universe. The first obstacle is that the world we observe at low energies is four-dimensional, while the best-understood solutions of string theory are ten-dimensional. Kaluza-Klein theory \\cite{Kaluza:1921tu,Klein:1926tv}, now more than a century old, provides a way to bridge this gap. If the extra dimensions correspond to a six-dimensional compact space that is smaller than the reach of any experimental probe then only three spatial dimensions will be seen. However, the size and shape of the extra dimensions are dynamical: they are parameterized by the expectation values of scalar fields known as moduli. Unless the moduli have large masses, they mediate long-range forces that are not observed in our world. Thus, a central problem of Kaluza-Klein theories is to provide a dynamical explanation for the requisite size of the extra dimensions, and to ensure that the moduli masses are consistent with experiment. 1                     What are the current methods for constructing and analyzing vacua with stabilized moduli in compactifications of string theory?   \n",

       "Thus, vacuum solutions of string theory are furnished by Ricci-flat six-manifolds. Consider a six-manifold $X_6$ with K\"ahler metric $g_{mn}$, and define the Riemannian holonomy group $\\text{Hol}(g)$. If $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3) \\subset SO(6)$, then $g$ is Ricci-flat, and we call $X_6$ a Calabi-Yau threefold. It follows that $X_6$ having holonomy $SU(3)$ is a sufficient condition for a vacuum solution of string theory in compactification on $X_6$. One striking property of such solutions is that the compactification preserves some of the supersymmetry found in the ten-dimensional theory. We are aware of no argument that $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3)$ is a necessary condition for Ricci-flatness, but every example of a compact Ricci-flat six-manifold constructed to date has holonomy contained in $SU(3)$ (see e.g.~\\cite{Acharya:2019mcu}). Even so, one should bear in mind the possibility that there may exist compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds with holonomy $SO(6)$ that furnish non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory. By necessity we will restrict our discussion to the known examples of vacuum solutions, i.e.~to Calabi-Yau threefolds. We stress, however, that the presence of supersymmetry in this context is not a consequence of an attempt to explain hierarchies in particle physics: it is instead a powerful aid to theoretical control. Specifically, the superstring is our starting point because superstring theories are vastly better-understood than non-supersymmetric string theories, and Calabi-Yau compactifications --- which preserve some supersymmetry at the compactification scale, though this may be broken to nothing at lower energies --- are our geometric focus because they are the only compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds known at the time of this writing.                                                                                                                                                                                                 1                                                What is the significance of a Calabi-Yau threefold in the context of string theory vacuum solutions?   \n",

       "Liam McAllister$^{a}$ and Fernando Quevedo$^{b}$ 30   We give an overview of moduli stabilization in compactifications of string theory. We summarize current methods for construction and analysis of vacua with stabilized moduli, and we describe applications to cosmology and particle physics. This is a contribution to the Handbook on Quantum Gravity.  The fundamental physical laws that govern our Universe must describe gravity and quantum mechanics. To discover the laws of quantum gravity, we cannot entirely rely on terrestrial experiments, or even on cosmological observations: the energies of observable processes are far too low to give a complete picture, in contrast to the way that collider experiments eventually revealed the Standard Model of particle physics. We may hope for some guidance from experiment, but theorists will have to provide a framework. String theory is such a framework: it is a theory of quantum gravity through which we can take a constructive approach to exploring possible laws of quantum gravity in our Universe. The first obstacle is that the world we observe at low energies is four-dimensional, while the best-understood solutions of string theory are ten-dimensional. Kaluza-Klein theory \\cite{Kaluza:1921tu,Klein:1926tv}, now more than a century old, provides a way to bridge this gap. If the extra dimensions correspond to a six-dimensional compact space that is smaller than the reach of any experimental probe then only three spatial dimensions will be seen. However, the size and shape of the extra dimensions are dynamical: they are parameterized by the expectation values of scalar fields known as moduli. Unless the moduli have large masses, they mediate long-range forces that are not observed in our world. Thus, a central problem of Kaluza-Klein theories is to provide a dynamical explanation for the requisite size of the extra dimensions, and to ensure that the moduli masses are consistent with experiment. 1                                                                                                                                     Stabilizing moduli in string theory compactifications involves finding solutions where the expectation values of scalar fields, known as moduli, are fixed at certain values to stabilize the extra dimensions. Current methods for constructing and analyzing such vacua include Flux Compactifications, Non-Perturbative Effects, and Gaugino Condensation, among others.  \n",

These extra dimensions are invisible because they are either too small to detect with current technology or because they are tightly curled up. The size and shape of these compact dimensions are dynamic and are described by scalar fields called moduli.  \n",

If the moduli fields are not stabilized or have masses that are too low, they could mediate long-range forces that have not been detected. Thus, ensuring the stabilization of moduli is essential to reconcile string theory with experimental observations and constraints from particle physics and cosmology.  \n",
       "Thus, vacuum solutions of string theory are furnished by Ricci-flat six-manifolds. Consider a six-manifold $X_6$ with K\"ahler metric $g_{mn}$, and define the Riemannian holonomy group $\\text{Hol}(g)$. If $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3) \\subset SO(6)$, then $g$ is Ricci-flat, and we call $X_6$ a Calabi-Yau threefold. It follows that $X_6$ having holonomy $SU(3)$ is a sufficient condition for a vacuum solution of string theory in compactification on $X_6$. One striking property of such solutions is that the compactification preserves some of the supersymmetry found in the ten-dimensional theory. We are aware of no argument that $\\text{Hol}(g) = SU(3)$ is a necessary condition for Ricci-flatness, but every example of a compact Ricci-flat six-manifold constructed to date has holonomy contained in $SU(3)$ (see e.g.~\\cite{Acharya:2019mcu}). Even so, one should bear in mind the possibility that there may exist compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds with holonomy $SO(6)$ that furnish non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory. By necessity we will restrict our discussion to the known examples of vacuum solutions, i.e.~to Calabi-Yau threefolds. We stress, however, that the presence of supersymmetry in this context is not a consequence of an attempt to explain hierarchies in particle physics: it is instead a powerful aid to theoretical control. Specifically, the superstring is our starting point because superstring theories are vastly better-understood than non-supersymmetric string theories, and Calabi-Yau compactifications --- which preserve some supersymmetry at the compactification scale, though this may be broken to nothing at lower energies --- are our geometric focus because they are the only compact Ricci-flat six-manifolds known at the time of this writing.                                                                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                                                                                                              Calabi-Yau threefolds are special six-manifolds in string theory that have the property of being Ricci-flat with holonomy group contained in $SU(3)$. They are important in compactifying the extra dimensions of string theory, and finding vacuum solutions that preserve some supersymmetry, which aids in theoretical control.  \n",
