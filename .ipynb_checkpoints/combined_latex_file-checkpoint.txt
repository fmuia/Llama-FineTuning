\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
X-ray astronomy provides a novel arena for fundamental physics. Thanks to exciting recent data, such as the observed excess at 3.5~keV \cite{Bulbul, Boyarsky}, there has been a renewed interest among particle physicists in the great promise of X-ray astronomy to shed light on physics beyond the Standard Model, including the existence of new particles.

One area for which X-ray astronomy is particularly suitable
 is in the search for Axion-Like Particles (ALPs).
ALPs are light pseudo-scalars that are a well motivated extension of the Standard Model \cite{PecceiQuinn,Wilczek,Weinberg} that arise
 generically in string compactifications, for example see \cite{hep-th/0602233,hep-th/0605206,1206.0819}. A general review of ALPs is \cite{RingwaldReview}. In the presence of a magnetic field $\langle B \rangle$ ALPs and photons interconvert \cite{Sikivie:1983ip, Raffelt:1987im}, and this induces quasi-sinusoidal oscillations at X-ray energies in the spectra of sources in and around galaxy clusters \cite{1304.0989, 1509.06748}.

Searches for these oscillations can be used to constrain ALP parameter space.
Current constraints on ALPs derived in this fashion \cite{1304.0989, Berg:2016ese, Marsh:2017yvc,Conlon:2017qcw} are based on data taken with CCD detectors, which have an energy resolution of $\mathcal{O}(100~\rm{eV})$. A large improvement with sensitivity will be achieved once data becomes available from microcalorimeters with $\mathcal{O}({\rm a~few} \, \rm{eV})$ energy resolution.
Such microcalorimeters will be on board the Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA), currently scheduled to launch in 2028.
Its X-IFU instrument will have both large effective area, good imaging and energy resolution of $\sim 2.5 \rm{eV}$, greatly enhancing the discovery potential for ALPs.

In this paper we provide a first estimate for the experimental sensitivity of {\it Athena} to ALPs. We do so using simulated data for a mock observation of NGC~1275, hosting the radio source 3C~84, which contains the central AGN of the Perseus cluster.
This object was chosen as we have previously used it to place bounds on ALPs using {\it Chandra} data \cite{Berg:2016ese}.

\section{Review of ALP-photon interconversion in clusters}
\label{alps}
An ALP $a$ couples to electromagnetism through the Lagrangian term:
\begin{equation}
\label{ALPphoton}
\qquad L = \frac{1}{4 M}~a~F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} =  \frac{1}{M}~a~{\bf E} \cdot {\bf B}~,
\end{equation}
where ${M^{-1} = g_{a\gamma\gamma}}$ parametrises the strength of the interaction,
and ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields.
As their potential and interactions are protected by shift symmetries, ALPs can naturally have very small masses $m_a$. The probability of ALP-photon interaction in the presence of an external magnetic field $\langle B \rangle$ is a standard result \cite{Sikivie:1983ip, Raffelt:1987im}. 

The full analytic expression for the probability of an ALP being converted to a photon after propagating through a single magnetic field domain of length $L$ is:
\begin{equation}
\qquad P_{a \rightarrow \gamma} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Theta^2}{1 + \Theta^2}\sin^2 \left( \Delta \sqrt{1 + \Theta^2} \right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\qquad \Theta = 0.28 \Bigg(\frac{B_{\perp}}{1 \mu\rm{G}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{\omega}{1 \, \rm{keV}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{10^{-3} \rm{cm}^{-3}}{n_e}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{10^{11} \rm{GeV}}{M}\Bigg),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\qquad \Delta = 0.54 \Bigg(\frac{n_e}{10^{-3} \rm{cm}^{-3}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{L}{10 \, \rm{kpc}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{1 \rm{keV}}{\omega}\Bigg).
\end{equation}
Here $B_{\perp}$ denotes the magnetic field component perpendicular to the ALP wave vector, $\omega$ is the energy and $n_e$ is the electron density. In the limit $\Delta, \Theta \ll 1$, $P \propto B^2 L^2 / M^2$. However when $\Theta < 1$ but $\Delta > 1$, then
$ P \propto \Theta^2 \sin^2 \Delta$.
This probability grows with energy, containing oscillations that are rapid at low energies and broader at higher energies. These
oscillations leave a distinctive imprint on otherwise featureless spectra, and their absence allows us to constrain $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.

This photon-ALP interconversion is particularly efficient in galaxy clusters (e.g. see ~\cite{0902.2320,1305.3603}).
Clusters have ${\bf B}$ fields of order $\sim \mu$G which extend over megaparsec scales, within which the magnetic field coherence lengths reach tens of kiloparsecs.
The relatively low electron densities ($\sim 10^{-3}\rm{cm}^{-3}$) also implies that it is at X-ray energies that the `sweet spot' of large
 $\Delta$, small $\Theta$, and  quasi-sinusoidal energy-dependent $P_{\gamma \leftrightarrow a}$ is located ~\cite{1304.0989, 1305.3603, 1312.3947, 1509.06748}.

The 3D structure of intracluster magnetic fields is in general not known and so
the precise form of the survival probability along any single line of sight cannot be determined. Figure~\ref{fig:ALPPhotonConversion} illustrates the energy-dependent survival probability for a photon passing across three hundred domains of a magnetic field, with the direction of the magnetic
field randomised within each domain. The electron density and magnetic field strength in
the model are based on those applicable in the Perseus cluster, but the pattern of smaller, rapid oscillations at low energies and slow oscillations with greater amplitude at high energies is generic.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) situated in or behind galaxy clusters provide excellent X-ray sources to search for such spectral modulations. One outstanding example is the bright central AGN of the Perseus cluster, at the heart of the galaxy NGC~1275.
Its intrinsic spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law \cite{Churazov:2003hr,Yamazaki, Balmaverde2006, Fabian:2015kua}, and dominates the background cluster emission. The central cluster magnetic field value is estimated at $ \sim 25 \mu$G by \cite{0602622}.

An analysis of archival data of observations of NGC~1275 by the {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} satellites was done in \cite{Berg:2016ese}
(see \cite{1603.06978} for a related analysis of NGC~1275 in gamma rays).
Extending methods pioneered in \cite{1304.0989}, the constraint on the ALP-photon coupling ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}}$ was found. For M87, a similar treatment was performed in \cite{Marsh:2017yvc}, finding a
bound ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}}$. An analysis of {\it Chandra} data of other bright point sources in galaxy clusters was conducted in (\cite{Conlon:2017qcw}), deriving bounds of ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}}$ (for the Seyfert galaxy 2E~3140) and ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}}$ (for the AGN NGC~3862).

%%{\bf These bounds are superior to those derived from SN 1987A, and are similar to IAXO in this low mass region. The absence of CMB distortions %\cite{Mirizzi:2009aj, Tashiro:2013yea} 
%%constrain the product $g B < 10^{-13} \text{GeV}^{-1} \text{nG}$, which are competitive with bounds from galaxy clusters if the cosmic magnetic field saturates the observed bound < nG. This is complementary to DM haloscopes searches.}

These bounds all hold for light ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12} {\rm eV}$. This implies that these methods are not sensitive
to an ordinary QCD axion, which for a photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 10^{-12} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ would typically have $m_a \sim 10^{-3} {\rm eV}$. However, unconventional models for the QCD axion where the photon coupling is significantly enhanced compared to naive expectation may
be constrained using these techniques.

The bounds produced are superior to the bound on light ALPs derived from SN 1987A of $g_{a \gamma \gamma} < 5 \times 10^{-12} \text{GeV}^{-1}$ \cite{Payez:2014xsa}, and are similar to those projected for IAXO in this low mass region \cite{Irastorza:2012qf}. The bounds are also superior to those inferred from the absence of CMB distortions in \mbox{COBE FIRAS} data \cite{Mirizzi:2009nq}, which constrain the product $g_{a \gamma \gamma} B < 10^{-11} \text{GeV}^{-1} \text{nG}$. Here $B$ is the strength of the cosmic magnetic field, which is limited to $B<\text{nG}$.

One major limiting constraint on existing data is the energy resolution of the detectors.
If they exist, ALPs provide oscillatory structure all the way down to the lowest energies.
However, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ALPPhotonConversion}, detectors with energy resolutions of $\mathcal{O}(100~\rm{eV})$ cannot resolve this structure at lower energies -- but this does become accessible once a resolution of $\mathcal{O}(2.5~\rm{eV})$ is achieved.  We now discuss the future {\it Athena} X-ray observatory, whose greatly enhanced technical capabilities offer improved sensitivity to ALP-photon interconversion.

\section{{\it Athena}}
\label{athena}
The Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) is an ESA mission to explore the Hot and Energetic Universe, due to launch in 2028 \cite{Nandra:2013shg}. The mirror will have a $2~\rm{m}^2$ effective area and a 5~arcsec angular resolution. There are two instruments: the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) and the Wide Field Imager (WFI). Here we focus on the former, which will consist of an array of TiAu Transition Edge Sensor (TES) micro-calorimeters sensitive to the energy range 0.2--12~keV \cite{Barret:2016ett}. When operated at a temperature of 50 mK, these can achieve an energy resolution of 2.5~eV below 7~keV \cite{Gottardi:2016cdx}, implying X-IFU will be able to resolve narrow spectral oscillations. A readout time of $\sim10~\mu\rm{s}$ will ensure pileup contamination is minimised. Table~\ref{satellites} contains
a summary of its properties, taken from the {\it Athena} Mission Proposal\footnote{http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/images/AthenaPapers/ \\ The\_Athena\_Mission\_Proposal.pdf}, compared to properties of the {\it Chandra} ACIS-I detector, taken from the {\it Chandra} Proposer's Guide\footnote{http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html}.

\begin{table}

\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|c|c}
& {\it Athena} (X-IFU) & {\it Chandra} (ACIS-I)\\

\label{satellites}
\end{table}

The combination of larger effective area, greatly improved energy resolution and reduced pileup contamination means {\it Athena} has far more potential to detect ALP-induced oscillations than the best current satellites. The aim of this paper is
to make the first quantitative estimate of the extent to which {\it Athena} will be able to improve constraints on
$g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.

\section{Estimate of projected bounds}
\label{bounds}
In terms of estimating bounds on $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ we use the same method as previously applied with
{\it Chandra} data \cite{Berg:2016ese}. This allows for a direct comparison
between the capabilities of {\it Chandra} and {\it Athena} in terms of placing bounds.

We simulate {\it Athena} observations of NGC~1275, using two models for the photon spectra of the AGN.
The first is a standard spectrum without ALPs, and the second is a model with the same spectrum multiplied with the
photon survival probability distribution as introduced in Section~\ref{alps}. Using simulations of the
X-IFU detector response, we fit spectra generated assuming ALP-photon conversion with the model without ALPs (Model 0) and then we compare this fit to the fit of the spectrum generated without ALPs to the same model.
To allow for the uncertainty in the
magnetic field configuration along the line of sight, we repeat this analysis using many different randomly generated magnetic fields.

The two photon spectra that we model are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Model 0: An absorbed power law plus thermal background:
\begin{equation}
\qquad F_{0}(E) = (A E^ {- \gamma} + \mathtt{BAPEC}) \times e^{-n_{H} \sigma(E,z)},
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $\gamma$ are the amplitude and index of the power law, $E$ is the energy, $n_H$ is the equivalent hydrogen column, $\sigma(E, z)$ is the photo-electric cross-section at redshift $z$, and $\mathtt{BAPEC}$ is the standard plasma thermal emission model.
\item Model 1: An absorbed power law plus thermal background, multiplied by a table of survival probabilities for photons of different energies:
\begin{equation}
F_{1}(E, {\bf B}) = (A E^ {- \gamma} + \mathtt{BAPEC}) \times e^{-n_{H} \sigma(E,z)} \times P_{\gamma \to \gamma} (E (1 + z), { \bf B}, g_{a \gamma \gamma})~.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
The index of the power law was set based on the best fit value from the cleanest {\it Chandra} observations of NGC~1275, and its normalisation was determined based on the {\it Hitomi} 230~ks observation of Perseus in 2016 \cite{Aharonian:2016gzq}. As the AGN in 2016 was
roughly twice as bright as in 2009 and it has previously exhibited large historical variation \cite{Fabian:2015kua}, it may be again much brighter (or dimmer) in 2028, which would affect both the contrast
against the cluster background and also the observation time required to achieve a certain constraint on $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$.

The 2016 {\it Hitomi} observation also constrained the temperature, abundances and velocity dispersion of the cluster thermal emission to a high degree of accuracy \cite{Aharonian:2016gzq}.
For the spectral shape of the cluster background, we used the single-temperature $\mathtt{bapec}$ model that was a good fit
to the {\it Hitomi} spectrum across its field of view. While this single-temperature model is unlikely to be a good fit for the background
contiguous to the AGN, it represents a useful proxy for the actual background that can only be determined at the time.
The normalisation of the background was set by extracting a circular region
of the cluster emission close to the AGN from the {\it Chandra} observations, of radius equal to the angular resolution of {\it Athena}, and determining the best fit. All model parameters are shown in Table \ref{parameters}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c|c}
Model & parameter & symbol & value\\ \hline \hline
$\mathtt{zwabs}$ & nH column density & $n_H$ & $0.24 \times 10^{22} \rm{cm}^{-2}$\\
 & redshift & z & 0.0176\\ \hline
$\mathtt{powerlaw}$ & index & $\gamma$ & 1.8\\
 & normalisation & A & $9 \times 10^{-3}$\\ \hline
$\mathtt{bapec}$ & temperature & kT & 3.48 keV\\

 & velocity dispersion & v & 178 m \,${\rm s}^{-1}$\\
& normalisation & N & $9 \times 10^{-4}$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameters of the absorbed power law describing the spectrum of NGC~1275, and the thermal model of the cluster background.}
\label{parameters}
\end{table}

As for the study with {\it Chandra}, we take the central magnetic field value as $B_0\sim 25\mu $G, following \cite{0602622}. We also
assume that $B$ decreases with radius as $B \propto n_{e}^{0.7}$.
As there is not a direct measurement of the power spectrum and coherence length for the Perseus magnetic field, we base the model on those inferred for the cool core cluster A2199 \cite{Vacca:2012up}.

The electron density $n_{e}$ has the radial distribution found in \cite{Churazov:2003hr}:
\begin{equation}
\qquad n_{e} (r) = \frac{3.9 \times 10^{-2}}{ [ 1 + (\frac{r}{80 \, {\rm kpc}})^2]^{1.8}} +  \frac{4.05 \times 10^{-3}}{ [ 1 + (\frac{r}{280 \, {\rm kpc}})^2]^{0.87}} \, {\rm cm}^{-3}.
\end{equation}

The magnetic field is generated over 300 domains, whose lengths are drawn from a Pareto distribution between $3.5~\rm{kpc}$ and $10~\rm{kpc}$ with power 2.8. In each domain the magnetic field and electron density are constant, with a random direction of ${\bf B}$. We then
calculate the survival probability of a photon passing through this region, as described in \cite{1312.3947}.

The simulations were performed using the Simulation of X-ray Telescopes ($\mathtt{SIXTE}$) code, a multi-instrument simulation package. It aims to offer an end-to-end simulation, i.e. the full detector chain from the source to the final data. It models the telescope's vignetting, ARF and PSF, and X-IFU's response, event reconstruction and pileup \cite{2014SPIE.9144E..5XW}.

The spectrum of NGC~1275, and the cluster background, were modelled in $\mathtt{XSPEC}$\footnote{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/manual.html} as an absorbed power law plus a thermal component, $\mathtt{zwabs*(powerlaw + bapec)}$. This spectrum, either multiplied with the photon survival probabilities or not, was converted to the SIMPUT\footnote{http://hea-www.harvard.edu/heasarc/formats/simput-1.0.0.pdf} file format using the command $\mathtt{simputfile}$. The mirror and detector response were modelled with $\mathtt{xifupipeline}$, using the ARF file $\mathtt{athena\_xifu\_1469\_onaxis\_pitch249um\_v20160401.arf}$ and the RMF file $\mathtt{athena\_xifu\_rmf\_v20160401.rmf}$. This generated an event FITS file, which was then converted into a PHA file using $\mathtt{makespec}$. We produced a fit to this spectrum in $\mathtt{XSPEC}$, using the Levenberg-Marquardt fitting method to calculate the reduced $\chi^2$. Figure~\ref{spectrum} shows one simulation for ${g_{a \gamma \gamma} = 3 \times 10^{-13} {\rm GeV}^{-1}}$ and its fit to an absorbed power law.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{200ks_3e-13_final_1.pdf}
\caption{A simulated 200~ks dataset for NGC~1275 with ${g_{a \gamma \gamma} = 3 \times 10^{-13} \rm{GeV}^{-1}}$, and its fit to Model 0. The characteristic ALP-induced modulations are apparent.}
\label{spectrum}
\end{figure}

We use the following procedure to determine whether a particular value of $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ is excluded: we varied the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ from $g_{a \gamma \gamma} = 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ to $g_{a \gamma \gamma} = 1\times 10^{-13} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$, with stepsize $0.5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$. As the bound is dependent on uncertainties in the magnetic field strength of a factor of 2, and we are only using simulated data, we do not consider step sizes smaller than this. For each $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate 50 configurations of the magnetic field $B_i$.
\item Use the $B_i$ to calculate the survival probability $P_{\gamma \rightarrow \gamma}$ along the line of sight for different photon energies (as done in \cite{1312.3947}). We calculate for 8000 equally spaced photon energies in the range 0.01--10~keV.
\item Combine each $P_{\gamma \rightarrow \gamma}$ with the AGN spectrum.
\item Generate 10 fake PHAs for each spectrum, providing 500 fake data samples in total.
\item Fit the fake data to Model 0, and calculate the reduced chi-squareds $\chi_1^2$.
\item Generate 100 fake PHAs based on Model 0, and compute the average of their reduced chi-squareds $\chi_0^2$.
Assuming the absence of ALPs, this represents the expected quality of the fit to the single real data set. If the actual data is a poor fit
for some reason, then this will weaken the level of the resulting bounds that we can produce.
\item Determine the percentage of fake data sets that have a reduced chi-squared $\chi_1^2 < \rm{max}(\langle \chi_0^2 \rangle,1)$. If this is true for fewer than 5 per cent of the data sets, the value of $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ is excluded at 95 per cent confidence.
\end{enumerate}

For a simulation of 200~ks of data with the nominal mirror configuration, we derive a projected
bound of ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-13}~ \rm{GeV}^{-1}}$ at 95 per cent confidence and of ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2.5 \times 10^{-13}~ \rm{GeV}^{-1}}$ at 99\% confidence, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExclusionLimit} alongside published data limits. This represents an order of magnitude improvement over the bound derived from the 200~ks of Chandra ACIS-I observations in \cite{Berg:2016ese}. We also find that even
a short 10~ks observation will lead to an improved bound of ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 4.5 \times 10^{-13}~ \rm{GeV}^{-1}}$.

These bounds are substantially better than any current experimental or astrophysical bound, and also go beyond the capabilities of IAXO for ultralight ALP masses. The proposed DM haloscope ABRACADABRA has the potential to explore $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ down to $10^{-17} \text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \in [10^{-14},10^{-6}] \text{eV}$  \cite{Kahn:2016aff}, if ALPs constitute the Dark Matter. The existence of ALP-induced oscillations in galaxy clusters is independent of this. Proposed CMB experiments such as PIXIE \cite{Kogut:2011xw} and PRISM \cite{Andre:2013afa} could produce a constraint $g_{a \gamma \gamma} B < 10^{-16} \text{GeV}^{-1} \text{nG}$ which might be competitive with bounds from galaxy clusters if the cosmic magnetic field is close enough to saturation $\sim \text{nG}$ \cite{Tashiro:2013yea}. Black hole superradiance also offers tentative constraints ALPs on in the mass range $m_a \in [10^{-14},10^{-10}] \text{eV}$, depending on measurements of black hole spin \cite{Arvanitaki:2016qwi}.

regime in this work and focus only on the low-mass region. Full references can be found in the Particle Data Group review on {\it Axions and other similar particles} \cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}.}\label{fig:ExclusionLimit}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
AGNs situated in galaxy clusters are excellent targets to search for ALP-photon interconversion. {\it Athena}'s groundbreaking new technology will be able to resolve AGN spectra very precisely. The bound ${g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-13}~ \rm{GeV}^{-1}}$ derived from simulations of 200~ks observations is an order of magnitude improvement over the bounds from current generation satellites. For the mass range ${m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}~\rm{eV}}$, it will also be far better than the bounds obtainable from future experimental searches such as IAXO.


We stress that this is only a first estimate of  the sensitivity of {\it Athena} to ALP-induced modulations. The final sensitivity will depend on the capabilities of the finished satellite, the brightness of the AGN in 2028 and the quality of the actual data.
Telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are likely to reduce the uncertainties in the magnetic field model \cite{Braun:2015zta}, allowing for greater precision in $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ bounds calculations by the time {\it Athena} launches. However, we have demonstrated that {\it Athena} will certainly improve bounds on $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ substantively, and that X-ray astronomy will continue to be at the forefront of ultralight ALP searches in the coming decades.

\section{Introduction}

Understanding the vacuum state of our universe is of paramount importance. The vacuum energy determines in great part the geometry of spacetime once gravity is considered. Quantum transitions between states of different vacuum energies should provide fundamental information on how to understand the vacuum states in a fully-fledged theory of quantum gravity. In particular it should help us to better understand the string theory landscape.\footnote{See~\cite{Cicoli:2023opf} for a recent review of string cosmology including attempts to  obtain de Sitter space in string theory. For alternatives such as quintessence see for instance \cite{Cicoli:2018kdo, Hebecker:2019csg, Cicoli:2021fsd}.} 
\vskip 1mm

Most of the progress in this direction has been made by using  semiclassical techniques.
In particular, the Euclidean approach pioneered by Coleman and collaborators \cite{Coleman:1980aw} borrows results from non-gravitational field theories  \cite{Coleman:1977py, Callan:1977pt} and makes a concrete proposal for the transition rate per unit volume of such a quantum transition. For the simplest set-up of a scalar field theory with a potential energy with two minima $A$ and $B$ with different values of the vacuum energy $V_A > V_B$  the Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) prescription~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} for the transition rate is:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{A\rightarrow B} \propto e^{-\left[S({\rm bounce})- S(A)\right]/\hbar} \,, \label{bounce}
\end{equation}
where $ S({\rm bounce})$ refers to the Euclidean action evaluated at the instanton solution (bounce) that mediates between the two vacua, and $S(A)$ is the Euclidean action evaluated at the background spacetime $A$. The process amounts to the creation of a bubble of vacuum $B$ in the background of vacuum $A$ mediated by the bounce. The explicit calculation boils down to determining the bounce as a solution of the Euclidean equations and plugging it into Eq.~\eqref{bounce}. We emphasise that Eq.~\eqref{bounce} is only a proposal and lacks an explicit derivation.
\vskip 1mm

In principle the same instanton can mediate the up-tunneling transition, from $B$ to $A$ ~\cite{Lee:1987qc},
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{B\rightarrow A} \propto e^{-\left[S({\rm bounce})- S(B)\right]/\hbar} \,, \label{bounce2}
\end{equation}
and cancels in  the ratio of transitions
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{\Gamma_{B\rightarrow A} }{\Gamma_{A\rightarrow B} } \propto e^{\left[S({B})- S(A)\right]/\hbar} \,.
 \end{equation}
 However, it has been argued that only in the case in which both vacuum energies are positive (de Sitter to de Sitter i.e. dS $\rightarrow$ dS transition), is up-tunneling  allowed since otherwise the background contribution $S(B)$ is negative and infinite, implying $\Gamma_{B\rightarrow A} \rightarrow 0$~\cite{Lee:1987qc}. In the allowed case 
  \begin{equation}
 \frac{\Gamma_{B\rightarrow A} }{\Gamma_{A\rightarrow B} } \propto e^{\left[S({B})- S(A)\right]/\hbar} \propto e^{-\left[\S_B- \S_A\right]/\hbar} \,, \label{detailed}
 \end{equation}
 where $\S_A=\pi/H_A^2, \, \S_B=\pi/H_B^2$ are the entropies of the two de Sitter spaces and $H^2=\Lambda/3$ determines the horizon radius $R_{dS}=1/H$ for a dS space~\cite{Gibbons:1976ue}. Eq. \eqref{detailed} is the statement of detailed balance: the ratio of probabilities is determined by the corresponding  number of available states which is measured by the exponential of the entropies. 
 \vskip 1mm
 
From this perspective, the fact that there are no up-tunneling vacuum transitions starting from Minkowski $\M$ or anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes corresponds to the fact that, contrary to the case of de Sitter space,  the volumes of both AdS and $\M$ are infinite. This implies that the corresponding background actions $S(B)$ diverge $S(B)\rightarrow -\infty$ and the transition rate vanishes.\footnote{Note that assuming that the partition function is approximated by one dS space-time, the Euclidean action is $S_E=\beta F=\beta E-{\S}$. If $E=0$ then $S_E=-\S$.} 
\vskip 1mm

Note that, following the dS analogy, this is consistent with assigning an infinite entropy to both $\M$ and AdS.\footnote{It should be noted however that assigning infinite Euclidean action to Minkowski and AdS is a consequence of ignoring the infrared regulator that Gibbons and Hawking \cite{Gibbons:1976ue},\cite{Gibbons:1977mu}  included in their calculation of black hole entropy. To get the well-known formula for black hole entropy (in Minkowski (M) or AdS space) one needs this regulator  which effectively implies that the Euclidean action and hence the entropy of empty  M or AdS space is zero. For a recent review of these entropy calculations as well as a Hamiltonian version which gives the same result see~\cite{deAlwis:2023tab}.} However, Eq.~\eqref{bounce} is only the result of an educated guess and it is not derived from a well defined prescription in quantum  gravity\footnote{Also the assumption that the bounce solution in gravity inherits the $O(4)$ symmetry that was derived  for flat space field theory is not justified.}, therefore we should be open to the possibility that it may not fully capture the relevant physics. 
\vskip 1mm

Note also that, contrary to dS, Minkowski and AdS do not have horizons and therefore assigning an entropy in terms of an area is not an option. On counting states, we know that the Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ in both cases is infinite which could indicate an infinite entropy. However, as  vacuum states both cases would be pure states with vanishing entropies.\footnote{In principle we can assign vanishing entropy to a full dS spacetime also, however in practice we are interested in the regions that are accessible to a given observer which has no access to the region beyond the horizon. Tracing out the states beyond the horizon gives rise to a non-vanishing entropy.} 
Therefore, thinking in terms of entropies we may ask two different questions: what is the transition rate between maximally mixed states in the Hilbert space or what is the transition rate only from the vacuum state (a  pure state). In the latter, the entropy vanishes and the corresponding up-tunneling amplitude is allowed. We will see that this is what is obtained once we use the Hamiltonian approach rather than the Euclidean approach to compute vacuum transitions.
 \vskip 1mm
 
 In the Hamiltonian approach developed by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP)\footnote{The FMP calculation was an attempt to understand from first principles in the Hamiltonian framework the singular instanton calculation of Farhi, Guth and Guven (FGG) \cite{Farhi:1989yr} whose validity was questioned even  by the original authors. Further concerns about the validity of both FMP and FGG have been raised over the years \cite{Freivogel:2005qh, Fu:2019oyc, Susskind:2021yvs}. See \cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg} for addressing the concerns in \cite{Freivogel:2005qh}. We will address the points raised by \cite{Susskind:2021yvs} in Sec.~\eqref{sec:susskind}. } \cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk} (see also \cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp, DeAlwis:2019rxg}),
vacuum transitions are defined as generalisations of the standard WKB method in Quantum Mechanics. This method has the advantage that the transition rate is actually computed (not guessed) following the standard WKB approach. No Wick rotations to Euclidean spaces are needed, nor any assumption about the dominant instanton contribution needs to be made. 
\vskip 1mm

On the other hand, the Hamiltonian approach lacks the flexibility of the Euclidean approach. For example the more general set-up in terms of a potential with two minima,  studied by CDL,  has not yet  been addressed in this formalism.\footnote{It should be borne in mind though that in practice the CDL procedure has proved amenable to calculation only in the thin wall regime - which is in effect equivalent to the brane nucleation calculation of the Hamiltonian approach and indeed to the Euclidean version of the brane nucleation calculation of Brown and Teitelboim \cite{Brown:1988kg}.} So far,  the Hamiltonian approach,  has only been developed for the simplest set-up of two  spacetimes of different cosmological constants $\Lambda_A, \Lambda_B$ separated by a wall of tension $\kappa$ that determines the bubble.  
\vskip 1mm

In any case, this is enough for our purposes in this paper. Precisely this simple set-up is what allows the calculations to be explicit and reliable. This is because after solving the energy and momentum constraints the problem reduces to a quantum mechanics problem with a single degree of freedom: the location of the wall $\hat R$. The resulting equation of motion is simple: $\dot{\hat R}^2 +V(\hat R)=-1$ where $V(\hat R)$ a calculable function of $\hat R$ determined from the parameters of the metric and the wall tension \cite {Blau:1986cw}. Then the standard quantum mechanics rules apply in terms of a transition through a barrier for a potential energy $V(\hat R)$.
\vskip 1mm

In this approach the transition probability from a state $A$ to $B$ is defined as the ratio of the two squares of the corresponding wave functions:
 
 \begin{equation}
 \Gamma_{A\rightarrow B}=\frac{|\Psi(\hat R_2)|^2}{|\Psi(\hat R_1)|^2} \,,
 \end{equation}
where $\hat R_1$ and $\hat R_2$ are the two turning points that are determined from the potential barrier $V(\hat R)$, see the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:potentialRhat}. The classical picture is that the brane, which contains inside it spacetime B, is nucleated with $\hat R = 0$ in spacetime $A$, grows to a radius $\hat{R}_1$, is reflected back and collapses back to zero. There is also a classical trajectory where the brane comes in from infinity with infinite size (at least in a non-compact space such as a black hole space) hits the barrier at $\hat{R}_2$ and is reflected back. Quantum mechanically the brane can tunnel between these two classical configurations. The wave functions can be written in terms of the WKB approximation as in standard Quantum Mechanics
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\hat R)=a e^I +b e^{-I} \,,
\end{equation}
where $I=iS$ is $i$ times the action evaluated at  $\hat R$. For the case when one of the two exponentials dominate, the transition rate can be written in terms of a difference between two actions, similar to Eq.~\eqref{bounce} but as we will see they differ in important ways.

On the left, a bubble is materialised in region $A$ and grows until it reaches the turning point $\hat R_1$ and classically bounces but quantum mechanically can tunnel to region $B$ at the second turning point to continue expanding. The  WKB approximation can be used in all the regions of the potential outside and inside the barrier. This is a typical situation for black hole geometries. On the right there is only one turning point (the first turning point has moved to zero) and the bubble materialises directly in state $B$. This is a typical potential for pure dS or AdS that can be obtained by setting the black hole mass to zero from the black hole geometry.} \label{fig:potentialRhat}}

In the next sections we will provide a short summary of this prescription and its application to explicitly compute the transition rates between vacuum states,  we will also include transitions between spacetimes with black holes and in the case that the true vacuum is de Sitter we will study its geometry. 
\vskip 1mm

Let us summarise the main results of this article:

\begin{itemize}
\item We explicitly compute the  rates for transitions between any of  dS and AdS states including both up and down tunneling and provide explicit expressions for each of the transition rates. The cases corresponding to up-tunneling from AdS are new results whereas the others are known and wherever the non-vanishing result is known we  agree with the previous results in the literature.

\item We consider Minkowski spacetime $\M$ in three different limits. First, starting from pure dS with curvature $\Lambda>0$  and taking the limit $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$: in this case we obtain vanishing up-tunneling transition as in the Euclidean case. Second, we start with an AdS spacetime with curvature $\Lambda<0$ and take the limit $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$. In this case we get a finite transition amplitude. We interpret the results by noticing that in the dS limit case, the entropy $\S\propto 1/\sqrt{\Lambda}\rightarrow \infty$ whereas in the AdS limit case the background contribution vanishes. This corresponds  to a vanishing entropy for AdS which is inherited in the Minkowski limit. The third limit is the one taken by FMP corresponding to the $M\rightarrow 0$ of  Schwarzschild spacetime. This coincides with the AdS limit and gives the same finite transition rate.

\item Having computed up-tunneling transitions from AdS we also compute the limit $\Lambda \rightarrow -\infty$. In this case up-tunneling to dS gives the well-known Vilenkin \footnote{Also known as tunneling or Vilenkin-Linde wave function.} and Hartle-Hawking~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp, Linde:1983mx, Rubakov:1984bh} transitions from nothing to dS. This $\Lambda \rightarrow -\infty$ limit is consistent with the proposal of Brown and Dahlen~\cite{Brown:2011gt} for a field theoretic definition of `nothing' precisely as AdS with infinite curvature, motivated by an interpretation of the bubble of nothing transition\footnote{However, they argued that the up-tunneling transition is forbidden and questioned the validity of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin set-ups. Our conclusion in this work  is that  not only are these transitions  allowed but that they reproduce exactly the same results as Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin wave functions.}. Therefore we find consistency between the two definitions of nothing (the decay to the bubble of nothing and the creation of dS from nothing). Furthermore we also explicitly compute transitions from nothing to AdS and $\M$ which were previously thought not to be allowed. 

\item A non-trivial check of our results is that we obtain detailed balance in all the transitions as long as $M\rightarrow 0$.

\item A further non-trivial check of our results is to generalise the transitions to include mass $M$ black hole backgrounds, which are the most general solutions with spherical symmetry which is the symmetry of the bubble/wall system. In this case we can compute the transitions and reproduce our previous results in the limit of $M\rightarrow 0$. 

\item In general, the black hole transitions depend on three regions for the values of $M$. Generalising FMP we compute the bulk contribution to the transitions in all regimes. Contrary to the $M=0$ limit some transitions are not allowed. However the Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) transition SdS$\rightarrow$ SdS is allowed and reproduces previous proposals. In particular it is consistent with detailed balance for small black holes (to be defined below). A point that has been recently questioned in \cite{Susskind:2021yvs}. A detailed discussion of the issues raised in this reference is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:susskind}.

\item When the true vacuum is de Sitter we compute the trajectory of the wall.  We will see that in the  case when $M\neq 0$,  contrary to that when $M=0$, we find that it does not follow a geodesic which favors  open universe slicing.

\end{itemize}

The order of the presentation is as expressed in the table of contents and may not need further explanation. The SdS $\rightarrow$ SdS case is technically more complicated due to the different horizons. It is done in full detail and in order to facilitate the readership we move it to an appendix that includes all technical details. 

In general, our results imply that populating  the  string landscape is straightforward and provide some hints on how this population may happen. In particular it incorporates the creation from nothing on the same footing as the other transitions.



\section{Hamiltonian Approach to Vacuum Transitions}



Let us start reviewing vacuum transitions from the Hamiltonian approach as initiated by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP) \cite{Fischler:1990pk}.  Starting with the spherically symmetric metric
 \begin{equation}
 ds^2=-N_t^2 dt^2+L(r,t)^2 (dr+N_r dt)^2+R(r,t)^2 d\Omega_2^2 \,,
 \end{equation}
in order to address the vacuum transition problem FMP considered the bulk-brane system with the brane (or wall) at $r=\hat r$ separating two regions with different cosmological constants $\Lambda_\pm$
and the following action:
\begin{equation}
S=S_{bulk}+S_{brane}-\int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\left(\Lambda_+\Theta(r-\hat{r})+\Lambda_-\Theta(\hat{r}-r)\right) \,,
\end{equation}
with standard Einstein-Hilbert   $S_{bulk}$ and brane action $S_{brane} $ respectively  and
 with $\Theta$ the step function. 

FMP reduced the vacuum transition problem to solving for the quantum mechanics of the
brane (assumed spherically symmetric) with a wave function $\Psi(\hat{R})$
which solves the Wheeler-deWitt  equation. In the leading WKB approximation this
implies solving the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints while satisfying
the matching conditions at the brane~\cite{Blau:1986cw}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:JunctionConditions}
\frac{R'(\hat{r}\pm\epsilon)}{\hat{L}}=\frac{1}{2\kappa\hat{R}}\left(\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}\right)\mp\frac{\kappa}{2}\hat{R} \,.
\end{equation}
 
Here $\kappa=4\pi G\sigma$  where $\sigma$ is the tension of the wall and $\hat{A}_{I,O}$ are the static metric functions evaluated at $r=\hat r$. The indices $I,O$ refer to interior and exterior of the wall;
 
 \begin{equation}
 A_{\alpha}  = 1-\frac{2GM_{\alpha}}{R}\mp H_{\alpha}^{2}R^{2}\,,  \qquad \alpha=I,O \,,
\end{equation}
 where $ \pm H_{\alpha}^{2}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\Lambda_{\alpha} $, with upper sign corresponding to de Sitter and the lower one to anti-de Sitter, and $M_\alpha$ is the standard integration constant corresponding to a black hole mass.
 Using the explicit expression for $\pi_{L}$ (in the gauge $N_{r}=0$)
one can write the (first integral of the) equation of motion for the
brane:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\hat{R}}^{2}+V & = & -1 \,,\label{eq:EofM}\\
V & = & -\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}})-\kappa^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{2}+(\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}-1)\label{eq:V}\\
 & = & -\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}})+\kappa^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{2}+(\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-1),\label{eq:Valt}
\end{eqnarray}
which is unbounded from below with a local maximum and one or two turning points at $V=-1$ depending on the parameters $H_\alpha, M_\alpha$. 
So the equation $V=-1$ gives the (two) turning points for $\hat{R}$,
$R_{1}<R_{2}$ for the classical motion of the brane. At a turning
point we see from Eq.~\eqref{eq:V} that $\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}>0$ and from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Valt} that $\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}>0$. 

The classical turning points of the geometry correspond to vanishing conjugate momenta for $L$ ($\pi_L=0$ which also implies $\pi_R=0$) \cite{Fischler:1989se}, which gives:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TurningPoints}
\frac{R'^{2}}{L^{2}} = A(R) = 1-\frac{2MG}{R}\mp H^{2}R^{2} \,.
\end{equation}
For $r=\hat r$ these correspond to the turning points of the potential (i.e. the solutions of $V=-1$).

The sign of $R'(\hat r)$ plays an important role since $R'$ is proportional to the extrinsic curvature $\hat K$ and indicates if the wall at $r=\hat r$ is bent towards the interior or exterior regions.


The transition probability\footnote{Note that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is like a time-independent Schrodinger equation in that there is no notion of time evolution. Consequently there is no obvious way to discuss the rate/lifetime of a state. In the case of non-gravitational field theory too, in order to discuss a rate one needs to construct a wave packet. For a discussion of this and for a critique of the standard Coleman approach to tunneling in field theory see \cite{Andreassen:2016cvx} and \cite{deAlwis:2023gth}. } from the initial state $\mathcal{B}$ to the nucleated state $\mathcal{N}$ (including the two spacetimes and the wall) can be written as:
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal P}\left(\mathcal{B}\rightarrow \mathcal{N}\right)=\frac{\|\Psi(\mathcal{N})\|^2}{\|\Psi(\mathcal{B})\|^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where the numerator can be identified as the squared wave function at the turning point $R_2$ and the denominator with that at $R_1$, as in the previous section.
These can be written in the WKB approximation as

\begin{equation}
\Psi=a e^I + b e^{-I}, \label{eq:PsiR0}
\end{equation}
 where $I=iS$. For the numerator we will have a bulk contribution $I_{\rm B}$ and a boundary contribution $I_{\rm W}$ which take the form:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:SclassicalBulk}
I_{{\rm B}} & = \frac{\eta}{G}\int_{0}^{\hat{r}-\epsilon}drR\left[ \sqrt{A_{{\rm I}}L^{2}-R'^{2}}-R'\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'}{L\sqrt{A_{{\rm I}}}}\right)\right] + \int_{\hat{r}+\epsilon}^{r_{\rm max}}dr \,\left[{\rm I}\rightarrow{\rm O}\right] \,, \\
\label{eq:SclassicalBoundary}
I_{{\rm W}} & = \frac{\eta}{G}\int\delta\hat{R} \, \hat{R}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'}{L\sqrt{\hat{A}}}\right)\bigg|_{\hat{r}-\epsilon}^{\hat{r}+\epsilon} \,.
\end{align}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:JunctionConditions} we can write explicitly:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Integrals}
I_{\rm W} = &- \frac{\eta}{G}\int dR R \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2(\pm H_{\rm O}^2 \mp H_{\rm I}^2 - \kappa^2)}{2 \kappa R \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm O}}{R} \mp H_{\rm O}^2 R^2}}\right)  \nonumber \\
&+ \frac{\eta}{G}\int dR R \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2 (\pm H_{\rm O}^2 \mp  H_{\rm I}^2 + \kappa^2)}{2 \kappa R \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm I}}{R} \mp H_{\rm I}^2 R^2}}\right) \,.
\end{align}


The total action is given by:
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot} = I_{{\rm B}} + I_{{\rm W }} \,,
\end{equation}

Note that at the turning points $R'^2=L^2 A$ and therefore the term in the expression for $I_{\rm B}$ the square root term vanishes and the argument of $\cos^{-1}$ is $\pm 1$. So the only non-vanishing contribution corresponds to $R'/L=-\sqrt{A} \leq 0$. This is a very strong constraint on the allowed values of the extrinsic curvatures. 
On the turning point geometry $\pi_{L}=0$ the first term vanishes
and the second term is non-zero only when the argument of the inverse
cosine is $-1$. This means that the bulk integral is given by

\begin{align}
S_{{\rm B}} & =\frac{i\eta\pi}{G}\left[\int_{0}^{\hat{r}}dr\frac{dR}{dr}R\theta\left(-R'\right)+\int_{\hat{r}}^{r_{\rm max}}dr\frac{dR}{dr}R\theta\left(-R'\right)\right]\label{eq:Bulk}\\
 & =\frac{i\eta\pi}{2G}\left[\left(\hat{R}^{2}-R^{2}(0)\right)\theta\left(-\hat{R}'_{-}\right)+\left(R_{{\rm }}^{2}(r_{\rm max})-\hat{R}^{2}\right)\theta\left(-\hat{R}'_+\right)\right] \,. \label{eq:Bulk-1}
\end{align}

 Note that the sign of $R'$ in the first line is determined by continuity and the sign of $\hat{R}'_{\pm}$ which is determined by the matching
conditions and fixed by the geometry on either side of $\hat{r}$.
It should  also be noted that if the geometry on either or both
sides has horizons then $R(0)$ may have to be replaced by the solution of $A_{I}=0$ (i.e. the smallest horizon) and $R(R_{\rm max})$ by the solution of $A_{O}=0$ since at a horizon the sign of $R'$ will change and will no longer contribute to the integral. 


A further condition is to guarantee that the bubble radius at the turning points is  real. Both conditions play a role in the concrete cases we will study next.


\subsection{dS to dS transitions}

The simplest transitions to study are dS to dS for which both down and up-tunneling are allowed. This correspond to the particular cases in which both black hole masses vanish, $M_I=M_O=0$. In the case of an initial dS (with $H=H_{{\rm O}}$) to a final dS (with
$H=H_{{\rm I}}$) we are in the limit $M_{O,I}\rightarrow 0$ had only one turning point so $R_{1}\rightarrow 0,R_{2}\equiv R_{0}$ with

\begin{equation}
R_{0}^{2}  = \frac{4\kappa^{2}}{(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2})^{2}+2\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm I}}^{2})+\kappa^{4}} \,.\label{eq:RoHH}  
\end{equation}

Also
\begin{eqnarray}
A_{{\rm O}} & = & 1-H_{{\rm O}}^{2}R^{2},\,\,A_{{\rm I}}=1-H_{{\rm I}}^{2}R^{2},\label{eq:AOIHH}\\
V & = & -\frac{1}{4\kappa^{2}}\hat{R}^{2}\left[(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2})^{2}+2\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm I}}^{2})+\kappa^{4}\right],\label{eq:VHH}
\end{eqnarray}
and there is no initial turning point. Also the matching conditions
are now
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat{R}'_{\pm}}{L}=\frac{1}{2\kappa\hat{R}}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2}\mp\kappa^{2})\hat{R}^{2}\equiv c_{\pm}\hat{R}\,. \label{eq:R'HH}
\end{equation}
 In this case we were able to evaluate explicitly the wall term as well as the 
 bulk term. For a general value
of $\hat{R}$ the latter  can be directly evaluated from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bulk} and gives 
\begin{equation}
I_{{\rm B}}\left(\hat{R}\right)\equiv iS_{{\rm Bu}}\left(\hat{R}\right)=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\hat{R}^{2}+\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}\right]\label{eq:SBHH0}.
\end{equation}

To get the tunneling factor we need to find the difference between the actions evaluated at the two turning points. However in the dS to dS case there is no initial turning point - so in effect it becomes $\hat R=0$. To make these WKB tunneling calculations well defined in the absence of an explicit parametrization as in \cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}, one should really consider this as the limit of the case with   an initial turning point before which there is a classical region. In other words this should be regarded as coming from the $M\rightarrow 0$ limit of the corresponding case with a black hole (see appendix) where we do have two turning points - $R_1$, $R_2$, with 
$R_{1}<R_{<}<R_{>}<R_{2}$, where $R_<$, $R_>$ are given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:R<>}. In the limit where the black hole masses go to zero $R_{1}<R_{<}\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore (see Fig.~\ref{fig:potentialSdS}) we see that $\hat R'_-$ at $\hat R = R_1$ is positive (and so is  $\hat R'_+$). Hence 
at this point  $\theta(-\hat R'_{\pm})$ are both zero. Hence with this definition of the initial turning point in the limit where the black hole masses are zero we have from Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH0}, $I_{{\rm B}}(\hat{R}=R_1\rightarrow 0)=0$. Thus defining the difference of the two turning point actions $I$ as $I(R_2)-I(R_1)\equiv I(R_2-R_1)$
 we have (with $R_2=R_0,~R_1=0$)
 \begin{equation}
I_{{\rm B}}\left({R_0-0}\right)\equiv iS_{{\rm Bu}}\left({R_0}-0\right)=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\hat{R}^{2}+\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}\right] \,.\label{eq:SBHH1}
\end{equation}


 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH0} is however not symmetrical between the outside and the inside of the spherical brane. This symmetry is a property of the full bulk (and wall) integrals (see  Sec.~\eqref{subsec:Reflection-symmetry-of} in the appendix) before imposing any turning point conditions. If we do impose this symmetry even at the turning point geometry (where $R'/L)=\pm \sqrt A$) then the above becomes
 
 \begin{equation}
I_{{\rm B}}\left(\hat{R}\right)\equiv iS_{{\rm Bu}}\left(\hat{R}\right)=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\hat{R}^{2}+\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}+\theta(\hat{R}'_{+})H_{O}^{-2}\right] \,.\label{eq:SBHH}
\end{equation}
This formula explicitly displays the symmetry under $O\leftrightarrow I$ which implies $\hat{R}_{\pm}\leftrightarrow-\hat{R}_{\mp}$. This was also the result was obtained in \cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg} where an explicit parametrization was used to compute the action at a general point (i.e. neither the geometry nor the brane were at a turning point\footnote{In fact with the explicit parametrization used in that paper putting the geometry at a turning point implied that the brane was also at a turning point. In other words the equation above is valid only at the turning points. This is a consequence of the relation $1-H^2_{I,O}a^2=\frac{1-{\hat R}^2/R_0^2 }{1-c^2_{-,+}{\hat R}^2} $ (with the $c$'s constants), which shows that when the geometry is at a turning point $a=H^{-1} $ then so is the brane, i.e. $\hat R=R_0$. Furthermore it shows that at $\hat R=0$ $a=0$, which is allowed since under the barrier dS space is a Euclidean 4-space.\label{foot:explicit}} and hence it automatically had this symmetry. Since we will not have the luxury of such a parametrization in the subsequent analysis it behoves us to understand the results in terms of general properties of the integrals.

To find the bulk action at 
 the initial point   we have to put  $\hat{R}=0$ in  equation \eqref{eq:SBHH}: However as argued below Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH0},  $\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\rightarrow0$ 
and $\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})\rightarrow0$ when $\hat R=R_1\rightarrow 0$.
\begin{equation}
I_{{\rm B}}\left(\hat{R}=0\right)=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}H_{O}^{-2} \,,
\end{equation}
 In this case we have 
 \begin{equation}
I_{{\rm B}}\left({R_0-0}\right)\equiv iS_{{\rm B}}\left({R_0}-0\right)=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\hat{R}^{2}+\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})H_{O}^{-2}\right] \,.\label{eq:SBHH'}
\end{equation}

The expressions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH1} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH'} differ when $\hat R'_+$ is negative.\footnote{Note however that if $\hat R'_+$ is negative then the last term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH} is zero and the difference of the turning point actions is the same as before.} As explained in detail in the appendix this difference comes from the fact that the explicit parametrization used in
~\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg} automatically includes the possibility of the brane being created behind the horizon (of an observer at  $R=0$) in the outside dS space.

Also, following ~\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}, the integrals appearing in the expression for $I_{\rm W}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Integrals} can be done analytically which we reproduce here for further use: %\footnote{We have used that $$\int_0^{1/\sqrt{1+a}}\, dx x \cos^{-1}\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-ax^2}}=\frac{\pi}{4a}\left( 1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}}\right). $$}:
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{\rm W}\Big |_{tp} &=& -\frac{\eta}{G} \int_0^{R_0} \delta \hat R \hat R\left [\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R'_+}{L\sqrt{\hat A_O}}\right)-\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R'_-}{L\sqrt{\hat A_I}}\right)\right ]\\ \nonumber
&= & -\frac{\eta \pi}{4G} R_0^2\left[\frac{\epsilon\left(\hat R'_+\right)}{1+|c_+|R_0}-\frac{\epsilon\left(\hat R'_-\right)}{1+|c_-|R_0}+2\left(\theta\left(-\hat R'_+\right)-\theta\left(\hat R'_-\right)\right)\right] \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $ \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{\pm})$ refer to the sign of $ \hat R^{\prime}_{\pm} $. 

Therefore, for general dS (and AdS) transitions the brane contribution being local is finite and can be computed explicitly:
\begin{eqnarray}\notag
I_{\rm W}(R_0-0) %\bigg|_{\rm tp}
 &= &\frac{\eta}{G} \left[\frac{\pi}{2}R_{0}^{2} \left(\Theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{-})-\Theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{+})\right)+\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm I}^{2}}\ \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{-})-\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm O}^{2}}\ \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{+}) + \right. \\
&& \,\,\,\,\, \left.- \pi \frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2}-H_{\rm I}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{\rm O}^{2}+H_{\rm I}^{2})}{8\kappa H_{\rm O}^{2} H_{\rm I}^{2}} R_{0} \right] \,. 
\label{eq:wall} 
\end{eqnarray} 
The total turning point action difference between the turning point $R_0$ and $0$ is then given by adding Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH'} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:wall}.


The transition probability is then  determined by ${\mathcal P}\propto e^B$ with $B=2\left([I_{\rm B}+ I_{\rm W}](R_0-0)\right)$, giving

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
B  =-\frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left\{ \frac{\left\{ (H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm I}}^{2})\right\} R_{{0}}}{4\kappa H_{{\rm O}}^{2}H_{{\rm I}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}-H_{{\rm O}}^{-2}\right)\right\} \, . } \label{eq:ItpdSdS}
\end{equation}

Note that  $R_0$ and $I_{{\rm B}}$ and $I_{{\rm W}}$  are symmetric under the exchange $H_{\rm I}\leftrightarrow H_{\rm O}$ even though the transition rate $B$ is not symmetric. Therefore the only difference between up and down tunneling comes from the action at $\hat R=0$ which is equal to the corresponding ($\eta$ times the) entropy. Hence (choosing $\eta =+1$)

\begin{equation}
\boxed{{\mathcal P}_{{\rm up}}=e^{\left(\S_{fv}-\S_{tv}\right)}{\mathcal P}_{down}} \,,\label{eq:updown}
\end{equation}
where $\S_{fv}$ and $\S_{tv}$ refer to the entropies of the false vacuum (higher $\Lambda$) and true vacuum (smaller $\Lambda$) respectively (where the entropy for dS space is taken to be $\S=\pi/(GH^2)$ ).  So this is the statement of detailed balance and corresponds to the choice of Hartle-Hawking (HH) boundary conditions as discussed in \cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}.
 If on the other hand we
had used the tunneling boundary conditions of Vilenkin and Linde $\eta=-1$,
we would have had to put (effectively) the coefficient $a$ in  Eq.~\eqref{eq:PsiR0} 
to zero. In this case we would have had the inverse
of detailed balance. This is
essentially because the wave function for tunneling to a
dS space from nothing is $e^{-S/2}$ rather than $e^{+S/2}$ as we
observed earlier. We speculate that this difference is due to the
fact that the HH wave function is a superposition of outgoing and incoming
waves, so is more appropriate for analysis in terms of equilibrium
thermodynamics than the tunneling wave function which is purely outgoing. For more details see~\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}.

\subsection*{dS to Minkowski}
For a dS to dS transition corresponding to horizons   $H_O$ and $H_I$ respectively, we can take the limit of $H_I\rightarrow 0$ to obtain the dS to Minkowski transition. Expanding in powers of 
$\varepsilon=H_I/H_O$ the turning point radius from Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH} is
\begin{equation}
R_0\simeq \frac{2\kappa}{H_O^2+\kappa^2}\left[1+\frac{H_O^2\left(H_O^2-\kappa^2\right)}{\left(H_O^2+\kappa^2\right)^2}\varepsilon^2 \right] \,.
\end{equation} 

Plugging this into the equation for $B$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:ItpdSdS}, and setting the limit $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ we get:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{B=-\frac{\eta\pi}{2GH_O^2}\left[\frac{\kappa^4}{\left(H_O^2+\kappa^2\right)^2}\right]} \,,
\end{equation}
which is the well-known dS to Minkowski result \cite{Fischler:1990pk,Coleman:1980aw,Bachlechner:2016mtp,DeAlwis:2019rxg}. Note however that this result is non-trivial since it required a cancellation between two divergent terms proportional to $1/\varepsilon^2$. In the up-tunneling case this cancellation does not occur and it can be seen as the source of the general belief that up-tunneling from Minkowski is forbidden. We will identify the source of this divergence and challenge this belief later on. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{dS to AdS}
Transitions among AdS spaces have  been studied in less detail in the Hamiltonian approach.  They can be treated in a similar way as the dS transitions changing appropriately the signs of $H^2$ in the original Eq.s~\eqref{eq:RoHH}-\eqref{eq:R'HH}. Here we will study them in more detail with the goal of writing explicit expressions for the transition rates. Let us start with dS to AdS transitions.


Let us get back to the general formulae for dS to dS tunneling, Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk}, that
were derived using the FMP
formalism in DMPQ (see also~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp}). 

On the turning point geometry $\pi_{L}=0$ the first term vanishes
and the second term is non-zero only when the argument of the inverse
cosine is $-1$. This means that the bulk integral is given by

\begin{align}
S_{{\rm B}} & =\frac{i\eta\pi}{G}\left[\int_{0}^{\hat{r}}dr\frac{dR}{dr}R\theta\left(-R'\right)+\int_{\hat{r}}^{r_{\rm max}}dr\frac{dR}{dr}R\theta\left(-R'\right)\right]\label{eq:Bulk-2}\\
 & =\frac{i\eta\pi}{2G}\left[\left(\hat{R}^{2}-R^{2}(b)\right)\theta\left(-\hat{R}'_{-}\right)+\left(R_{{\rm }}^{2}(c)-\hat{R}^{2}\right)\theta\left(-\hat{R}'_{+}\right)\right] \,.\label{eq:Bulk-3}
\end{align}
Here we have defined $r=b$ to be the lowest value of the parameter for which $R'$ is negative and $c$ is the highest value of the parameter for which $R'$ is negative. Note that the sign of $R'$ in the first line (and hence its parametrization) is determined by continuity
and the sign of $\hat{R}'_{\pm}$ which is determined by the matching
conditions and fixed by the geometry on either side of $\hat{r}$.
It should be also be noted that if the geometry on either or both
sides has horizons then $R(b)$ should be replaced by the solution
(horizon) to $A_{I}=0$ and $R(c)$ by the solution to $A_{O}=0$.

In the current case dS has a horizon $R_{{\rm D}}^{2}=H_{{\rm dS}}^{-2}$
while AdS has no horizon. Let us consider the transition $A\rightarrow B$
where $A$ is deSitter and $B$ is AdS. Thus (recall that $H^{2}\equiv\frac{8\pi G\Lambda}{3}$
is positive for dS and negative for AdS), $A_{O}=1-H_{A}^{2}R^{2}$
and $A_{I}=1-H_{B}^{2}R^{2}=1+|H_{B}^{2}|R^{2}$ and $\hat{R}_{\pm}=\frac{1}{2\kappa}\left(H_{A}^{2}+|H_{B}|^{2}\mp\kappa^{2}\right)\hat{R}$.
The last equation implies that $\hat{R}'_{-}/L>0$. Thus the first
term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bulk-1} is zero. Also the step function in the integral
requires $R$ to be a decreasing function of $r$ to contribute, and there is internal
horizon in empty dS (no black hole) $R(r_{\rm max})=0$.  The latter region  of course gives no contribution to the integral. Hence we have (note that from Fig.~\eqref{fig:potentialdS}, $\hat R'_+$ is negative and remains negative in the limit $M\rightarrow 0$ for all $R\geq 0$ )
\begin{equation}
S_{{\rm B}}\left(\hat{R}\right)=\frac{i\eta\pi}{2G}(0-\hat{R}^{2})\,,\qquad \,S_{{\rm B}}\left(0\right)=\frac{i\eta\pi}{2G}(0) \,.
\end{equation}

Note that a potential divergence (since AdS is non compact)  is averted since the step function in the first term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bulk-1} is zero.  Subtracting the second equation from the first and adding the wall contribution we thus get: 

\begin{equation}
\boxed{ 
B^{{\rm dS \rightarrow AdS}}=\frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left\{ \frac{\left\{ (H_{A}^{2}+|H_{B}^{2}|)^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{A}^{2}-|H_{B}^{2}|)\right\} R_{{\rm o}}}{4\kappa H_{A}^{2}|H_{B}^{2}|}-\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{A}^{-2}+|H_B^{-2}|\right)\right\} , }\label{eq:BdSAdS}
\end{equation}
with $R_{0}$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH} with the above substitution
$H_{B}^{2}\rightarrow-|H_{B}^{2}|$. Also in this case there is no
constraint on the tension $\kappa$. Note that this formula is in agreement with that calculated by Brown and Tetelboim using Euclidean methods. It is in fact exactly the same as the dS to dS formula with $H^2_B\rightarrow -|H^2_B|$.

As in the case of dS to dS the configuration after the transition
is actually the patching together of the original dS with an AdS
space separated by a wall. The latter will however collapse if any
matter is introduced as argued in \cite{Coleman:1980aw}. After the
collapse we will be left with a segment of dS space bounded by an
end of the world brane. On the other side of the brane there is no
geometry left and is equivalent to Witten's bubble of nothing \cite{Witten:1981gj}.

\subsection{AdS to AdS}



The AdS to AdS transitions can be analysed similarly to the previous ones.
However for transitions between AdS states there is a constraint that needs to be satisfied to guarantee that the turning point radius $R_0$ is real.
In this case $H_{I}^{2}=-|H_{I}|^{2}<0,\,H_{O}^{2}=-|H_{O}|^{2}<0$.
Now we have from Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH},
\[
\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\left(-|H_{O}^{2}|+|H_{I}^{2}|\right)-\kappa\right)^{2}>|H_{O}^{2}| \,.
\]
i.e.
\begin{equation}
\kappa < \Big |\sqrt{|H_{I}^{2}|}-\sqrt{|H_{O}^{2}|}\Big | \,,\qquad {\rm or}\qquad \kappa > \Big |\sqrt{|H_{I}^{2}|}+\sqrt{|H_{O}^{2}|}\Big | \,,\label{eq:kappaconstraint}
\end{equation}


In this case,
\begin{equation}
S_B[\hat R]=\frac{\eta \pi}{2G}\left[ \left(\hat R^2-R^2(0)\right) \theta (-\hat R'_-)+\left(R^2(\infty)-\hat R^2 \right) \theta (-\hat R'_+)  \right] \,.
\end{equation}
Also from Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'HH}  (with $H^2\rightarrow -|H^2|$) we see that for down tunneling $|H_I|^2>H_O|^2$, $\hat R'_-$ and $\hat R'_+$ are both positive for small $\kappa$, so we get $ S_B[\hat R]=S_B[0]$ and therefore the bulk contribution vanishes and the total rate comes from the wall contribution:
$I_{\rm tot}=I_{\rm W}$.

For down tunneling we then have $B=2I_{\rm W}$:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{B=-\frac{\eta \pi}{2G}\left[ \frac{\left(\big |H_I^2 \big |-\big |H_O^2 \big |\right)^2-\kappa^2 \left (\big |H_I^2 \big |+\big |H_O^2 \big |\right)}{2\kappa \big |H_I^2 \big |\big |H_O^2 \big |}R_0-\left(\frac{1}{\big |H_O^2 \big |}-\frac{1}{\big |H_I^2 \big |}\right)\right]} \,.
\end{equation}

Even though this looks very similar to the dS to dS transition case note that the sign differences and the fact that the bulk contribution vanishes make a major difference. In particular note that 
for the up-tunneling we have to change $|c_+|$ to $|c_-|$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:wall} but also the signs of $\hat R'_\pm$ are interchanged and therefore the amplitude does not change. This means that 
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal P}_{\rm up}^{{\rm AdS}\rightarrow {\rm AdS}}={\mathcal P}_{\rm down}^{{\rm AdS}\rightarrow {\rm AdS}}\,.
\end{equation}
This is a new result and this  relation is still trivially  consistent with detailed balance if we assign zero entropy to AdS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Minkowski to AdS}

First let us look at the expression for the bubble radius Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH}. 
Taking the limit $H_{0}\rightarrow0$ we get after putting $H_{I}^{2}\rightarrow-|H_{I}^{2}|$
\[
R_{0}=\frac{2\kappa}{|-|H_{I}^{2}|+\kappa^{2}|}\left(1-\frac{H_{0}^{2}(\kappa^{2}+|H_{I}^{2}|)}{(-|H_{I}^{2}|+\kappa^{2})}+O\left(H_{0}^{4}\right)\right) \,.
\]

Now since $R_{0}\geq0$ one should take $R_{0}=2\kappa/|\kappa^{2}-|H_{I}|^{2}|+O(H_{0}^{2})$
but FMP ruled out the case $\kappa>|H_{I}|$ (in this case it turns
out that in the limit $H_{0}\rightarrow0$ the tunneling exponent
$B$ diverges), so let's focus on the case $|H_{I}|>\kappa$. Taking
the limit $H_{0}=H_A\rightarrow 0$ in \eqref{eq:BdSAdS} with
$|H_B|^2=|H_{I}|^{2}$ we get for the tunneling exponent,
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\\ \\
B=2\left( I_{{\rm tot}}|_{{\rm tp}}-\bar{I}\right)=-\frac{\eta\pi}{2G|H_{I}|^{2}}\left[\frac{2\kappa^{4}}{\left(|H_{I}|^{2}-\kappa^{2}\right)^{2}}\right] \\ } \,,\label{eq:MAdS}
\end{equation}
in agreement with~\cite{Fischler:1990pk,Coleman:1980aw}.

Let us look at this in stages separating the bulk and boundary (wall) terms. 
First we note that for $|H_{I}|^{2}>\kappa^{2}$, $\hat{R}_{\pm}^{'}>0$.
Thus we have  $I_{{\rm B}}=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{0}^{2}}$
and $\bar{I}=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{0}^{2}}$ so that $I_{{\rm B}}-\bar{I}=0$,
so that the bulk contribution vanishes after background subtraction
and the decay rate is fully determined by the wall contribution $ I_{{\rm W}}$ which in this limit is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}B=I_{{\rm W}}=-\frac{\eta\pi}{4G|H_{I}|^{2}}\left[\frac{2\kappa^{4}}{\left(|H_{I}|^{2}-\kappa^{2}\right)^{2}}\right] \,,\label{eq:MAdS2}
\end{equation}
in agreement with Eq.~\eqref{eq:MAdS} as expected.
 
 

Let us note the following issue regarding these transition probabilities.  We have that
${\mathcal P}({\mathcal M}\rightarrow{\rm AdS})\sim e^{-|B|}$. This is the fact
that the transition probability goes to unity the deeper the AdS minimum
is i.e. in the limit $|H_{I}|^{2}\rightarrow\infty$. This  means the Minkowski space is unstable to decaying to the
deepest (in the EFT this would mean $|\Lambda|^{1/4}\lesssim M_{P}$
or the string or KK scale if the theory is compactified string theory).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{AdS to dS/M}
In order to avoid potential problems with the parametrization in this case, one needs to consider it as up-tunneling to dS ($A$) from an AdS black hole in the the limit $M\rightarrow 0$ ($B$). The latter is essentially the same as that studied by FMP. Since both Minkowski and AdS have no horizon the calculation in the Appendix (which is a reproduction of the FMP one) for the small mass case $iii$) applies and so from Eq.~\eqref{eq:FMP3} (setting $R_1=R_s=M=0$),

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FMP3}
S_{{\rm Bu}}\left(R_2=R_{0}\right)-S_{{\rm Bu}}(R_{1}=0)=-\frac{i\eta\pi}{G}\left(H_A^{-2}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
In this case there is no constraint on the tension $\kappa$ and adding the wall term we get
\begin{equation}
\boxed{B^{{\rm AdS \rightarrow dS}}=\frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left\{ \frac{\left\{ (|H_{B}^{2}|+H_{A}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(-|H_{B}^{2}|+H_{A}^{2})\right\} R_{{\rm o}}}{4\kappa|H_{B}^{2}|H_{{\rm A}}^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}-\frac{1}{|H_{B}^{2}|}\right)\right\} \,, }\label{eq:BAdSdS}
\end{equation}
with $R_{0}$ again given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH} with the substitution
$H_{B}^{2}\rightarrow-|H_{B}^{2}|$.


For $|H_{B}^{2}|>|H_{A}|^{2}$ and small $\kappa$ the factor in
parentheses in the expression above for $B$ is positive, so choosing
$\eta=-1$ we get an exponentially suppressed tunneling probability
and hence an exponentially enhanced lifetime and so gravitational
collapse is exponentially more likely than tunneling to dS. However this depended on the
choice of $\eta=-1$ which is not what one chose for the
dS to dS case, where the issue was settled (as discussed in Sec.~3 of~\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}), by arguing that this choice (which corresponds
to the HH wave function rather than the tunneling one), gives the dominant
contribution to the wave function (and indeed was consistent with
detailed balance). Here we cannot make the same argument since that
calculation   depended crucially on the compactness of the spatial
sections of dS. 

On the other hand detailed balance holds (see below) as in the dS to dS case for the
$\eta=1$ case.  In this case this quantum transition is exponentially more probable than the gravitational collapse of AdS.
Then we have a situation where the AdS can tunnel to a configuration
of AdS separated by a wall/brane from a dS space with the AdS eventually
collapsing leaving behind a dS bounded by a end of the world brane. 

However it should be noted that the `Minkowski' limit $H_{A} \rightarrow 0$
is in fact divergent $B^{{\rm AdS \rightarrow dS}}\rightarrow\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}\rightarrow\pm\infty$.
This is to be expected since the limit is taken from the amplitude
for transition to a dS space whose horizon and hence entropy diverges
as the dS radius goes to infinity. This is in contrast to the corresponding
up-tunneling from AdS to a Minkowski space (M) which is the limit of the AdS radius going to infinity. Note
that this limit has the same topology as M in contrast to the infinite radius limit of dS which still has the topology of a sphere.


\subsection{From nothing and back?}

In an interesting article, based on concrete cases of flux compactifications in 6D, Brown and Dahlen \cite{Brown:2011gt} have suggested interpreting
‘nothing' as the infinitely curved AdS space (to which their flux
compactified 6D theory decays to). The argument is very intuitive and explicit since they consider how the minimum of the scalar potential gets reduced by reducing the quantised fluxes and the corresponding geometry gets closer and closer to the bubble of nothing geometry of Witten  \cite{Witten:1981gj} until it reaches it in the limit of $-\infty$ cosmological constant. This interpretation is very appealing since it unifies the two concepts of nothing (the bubble of nothing and the creation from nothing). Also from the AdS/CFT interpretation, an infinite AdS curvature corresponds to a vanishing central charge which  would imply zero degrees of freedom and fits well with the concept of nothing.


This interpretation is actually
consistent with the mini-superspace ‘nothing’ which was the starting
point for the ‘no-boundary’ wave function HH or the tunneling wave
function of Vilenkin and Linde tunneling from nothing. However their
argument that up-tunneling from AdS to dS/M is prohibited (based on
the non-compactness of the spatial sections of AdS)\footnote{In any case the argument depended on not including the Gibbons-Hawking regulator term as in the Euclidean arguments mentioned earlier.} is not necessarily valid since
as we saw earlier the FMP bulk contribution is zero at the turning
points so that the tunneling amplitude is actually finite. To see
this let us take the limit $|H_{B}^{2}|\rightarrow\infty$ first in Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH} (with $H_{O}^{2}\rightarrow-|H_{B}^{2}|$ which
gives $R_{0}\rightarrow2\kappa/|H_{B}^{2}|$) and then substituting
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:BAdSdS} we get
\[
B^{{\rm AdS \rightarrow dS}}\rightarrow\frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left\{ \frac{\left\{ (|H_{B}^{2}|)^{2}\right\} 2\kappa/|H_{B}^{2}|}{4\kappa|H_{{\rm B}}^{2}|H_{A}^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}+0\right)\right\} =\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}} \,.
\]
 That is if we define as nothing the limit of AdS with $|H_B|\rightarrow \infty$. We get:
 \begin{equation}
 \boxed{B^{{\rm Nothing \rightarrow dS}}=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}} \,.
 \label{eq:nothingrate}
 \end{equation}
This is precisely the (log of the) Hartle-Hawking (for $\eta=+1$) or the Vilenkin-Linde (for $\eta=-1$) tunneling factor for creating a universe from nothing.

Thus, we agree with the proposal of \cite{Brown:2011gt} to identify the two definitions of nothing, the limit of infinite curvature AdS as representing the bubble of nothing and the nothing of Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking regarding the wave function of the universe interpretation as creation from nothing. But contrary to the claim of \cite{Brown:2011gt} in which creation from nothing does not happen,  we can reproduce
the tunneling from nothing picture  by interpreting nothing
as deep AdS as they did. It is interesting to note that even though
the bubble radius goes to zero in this limit (which normally would
have been interpreted as signalling the absence of tunneling) the singularity in $B/2$ cancels resulting in a finite tunneling probability.

We may question the validity of taking the limit $|H_B|\rightarrow \infty $ since the EFT is only valid up to energies smaller than the Planck mass. But we can reproduce this result as the leading term in an expansion in powers of $\varepsilon^2=H_A^2/|H_B|^2$ and $\delta^2=\kappa^2/|H_B|^2$ with $\varepsilon,\delta \ll 1$ but still keeping $|H_B|\leq M_P$.

\subsubsection*{Detailed balance in dS/AdS transitons.}

The results of the above subsections shows that detailed balance holds
for dS to and from AdS transitions provided we assign zero entropy to empty Anti-deSitter space (as one should expect
given that empty AdS has no horizon).  In this case we have,
\begin{equation}
\frac{P^{{\rm AdS \rightarrow dS}}}{P^{{\rm dS \rightarrow AdS}}}=\frac{e^{B^{{\rm AdS \rightarrow dS}}}}{e^{B^{{\rm dS \rightarrow AdS}}}}=\frac{\exp\left(\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{1}{H_{A}^{2}}\right)}=e^{\eta\left(S_{{\rm dS}}-\left(S_{{\rm AdS}}=0\right)\right)} \,,\label{eq:dSAdSdb}
\end{equation}
which is the statement of detailed balance (taking $\eta=+1$).  Note that the
result holds also in the limit $H_{B} \rightarrow 0$ which is the Minkowski
limit of AdS so that detailed balance holds for transitions between
dS and Minkowski space-times provided of course that we assign zero
entropy to empty Minkowski space. 

\subsubsection*{Comparison to Euclidean methods}

In the Euclidean calculations (CdL, BT) it appears that up-tunneling
from AdS (or M) to dS is forbidden. However that is because in those
calculations the background action is taken to be proportional to
the volume of AdS space - which is infinite. However as we see from Eq.~\eqref{eq:BAdSdS} in the WKB calculation the initial point is
$\hat{R}=0$ so we had $S_{{\rm B}}\left(0\right)=0$ rather than
infinity. This is also consistent with taking the limit of the black hole mass to zero in the SAdS to dS calculation of Sec.~\ref{sec:sdstosds}.

The difference in fact corresponds to the different assignments of
entropy to AdS space. Our calculations (both the direct AdS to dS
and the SAdS to dS) effectively assigned zero entropy to empty AdS
space. The Euclidean calculation on the other hand effectively assigned
infinite entropy to empty AdS.

\section{Transitions from Black Hole Backgrounds}

Let us now consider the most general situation allowed by spherical symmetry, namely that the solution to Einstein's equations include a mass parameter $M$ that appears as an integration constant in the solution of the Hamiltonian constraints that corresponds to a black hole mass. Since the Schwarzschild solution implies the existence of a horizon considering $M\neq 0$ makes an important difference.\footnote{Note that in following the Hamiltonian approach,  which at this point is amenable to computation only in the extreme thin wall (brane) approximation, we have nothing to add to the current debate regarding the impact of black holes in Higgs decay~\cite{Gregory:2013hja,Burda:2015isa, Canko:2017ebb, Strumia:2022jil}.}

 
\subsection{SdS to SdS}


As discussed above,the classical turning points for the geometry occur at $\pi_{L}=0$,
i.e. 
\[
\frac{R'^{2}}{L^{2}}=A(R)=1-\frac{2MG}{R}-H^{2}R^{2} \,.
\]
When $r=\hat{r}$ these are the turning points for the brane i.e.
the solutions of $V=-1$. For $3\sqrt{3}GM<H^{-1}$ the geometry has
two horizons $R_{b}<R_{c}$. We may identify $R_{s}$ as the black hole
(Schwarzchild) horizon (becoming $2GM$ when $H\rightarrow0)$ while
$R_{c}$ is the cosmological horizon (becoming $H^{-1}$ when $M\rightarrow0$).
We have
\begin{align*}
A =-\frac{H}{R}\left(R-R_{-}\right)\left(R-R_{b}\right)\left(R-R_{c}\right) \,,\\
R_{-}<0 <2GM<R_{b}<3GM<R_{c} \,.
\end{align*}
We also see from the turning point equation $V=-1$ that
\[
R_{b}<R_{1}<R_{2}<R_{c} \,.
\]
For the turning point geometries the bulk action $S_{B}$ simplifies
with the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} giving zero and the second term
contributes only when $\epsilon(R')=-1$ i.e. whenever $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'}{L\sqrt{A_{{\rm I,{\rm O}}}}}\right)=\pi$.
Thus we have
\begin{eqnarray}
iS_{{\rm B}}(\hat{R}) & =- & \frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left[\int_{0}^{\hat{r}}drR'R\theta(-R_{-}')+\int_{\hat{r}}^{r_{\rm max}}drR'R\theta(-R_{+}')\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left[\int_{0}^{\hat{R}}dRR\theta(-R_{-}')+\int_{\hat{R}}^{R(r_{\rm max})}dRR\theta(-R_{+}')\right] \,.\label{eq:SBtp}
\end{eqnarray}
The general dS-black hole case is complicated. It is discussed in detail in the appendix - see Sec.~\eqref{sec:sdstosds}.

For the small black hole case the direct calculation in a static patch between the two horizons gives \begin{align}
I_{{\rm {\rm Bu}}}\left[\hat{R}\right]  =\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\hat{R}^{2}+\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-})\left(R_{I,c}^{2}\right)-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})\left(R_{O,b}^{2}\right)\right]
  \,.\label{eq:Ibulk0}
\end{align}

Hence we get after adding the wall contribution
(see Eq.~\eqref{eq:IAB})
\begin{equation}
I^{AB}\left[R_{2}-R_{1}\right]=\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[\left(R_{{\rm c}}^{B}\right)^{2}-\left(R_{{\rm {\rm b}}}^{A}\right)^{2}\right]+I_{W}^{AB}\left[R_{2}-R_{1}\right] \,.\label{eq:IAB}
\end{equation}

 

Let us now consider the transitions $A\rightarrow B$ (with $S_{A}>S_{B}$)
which we may call up-tunneling and $B\rightarrow A)$ we call down-tunneling. Noting that the wall action $I_{W}$ is symmetric under the interchange of  $A$ and  $B$.\footnote{While the bulk action is symmetric only for a general point and loses this symmetry at the turning points $R_{1,2}$ the wall action clearly has this symmetry even at these points as
is seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:WIO}.} Hence  we get, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_{\uparrow}}{P_{\downarrow}}=e^{\frac{\pi}{G}\left[\left(R_{B,c}^{2}-R_{A,b}^{2}\right)-\left(R_{A,c}^{2}-R_{B,b}^{2}\right)\right]}=e^{\S_{B}-\S_{A}}.\label{eq:detalied balcance}
\end{equation}

Defining the total entropy of SdS space as $S\equiv \frac{\pi}{ G}(R^2_c+R^2_b)$ (i.e. the sum of the  cosmological and black hole horizon entropies).
Thus we have non-trivially obtained detailed balance again.

In the limit $R_{A,Bs}\rightarrow0$ we recover the earlier results
for $dS$ to $dS$ transitions. One may think that to get FMP/FGG
we need to take $R_{A,c}\rightarrow\infty$. This would give $P_{\uparrow}\rightarrow0$
in agreement with the corresponding limit in the dS to dS case. The
FMP/FGG case however corresponds to subtracting the infinity in the
horizon area term of dS/SdS when the dS radius goes to infinity to
get the entropy of the black hole in asymptotically Minkowski space
to be just the black hole entropy. 

The difference comes from the fact that in the asymptotically Minkowski
case Gibbons and Hawking \cite{Gibbons:1976ue} added a term (to
the boundary term which is necessitated by Dirichlet boudary conditions)
evaluated in flat space which cancels the otherwise infinite contribution
of the GHY term in the asymptotic limit. This infra-red subtraction
is what gives the entropy of the black hole to be $\pi r_{s}^{2}$
and the entropy (as well as the ADM energy) of flat Minkowski space
to be zero.\footnote{In \cite{Weinberg:2012pjx} page 283 it is stated the GHY term for Minkowski is negative infinity and is zero in the absence of the GHY term. However it should be noted that the GHY term consists of two pieces and the second piece is explicitly included to make the Minkowski vacuum action (and hence its entropy) zero. A similar term should be included if the AdS vacuum is to be assigned zero entropy since it has no horizons. This means that the entropy of both a Minkowski black hole and an AdS black hole is just the horizon entropy of the black holes.} This is a physical requirement. In other words the infinite
radius limit of dS space is not flat Minkowski space any more than
a topological 3-sphere of arbitrarily large radius is the same as
$R^{3}.$ The topology of dS is $R\times S_{3}$ and however large
its radius, is not $R^{4}$. Thus  the above formulae - although
valid for SdS spaces of arbitrary radii, do not imply (from the vanishing
of Eq.~\eqref{eq:detalied balcance}) that they forbid up-tunneling from
asymptotically Minkowski space. 

In fact it has been argued by many authors (perhaps the earliest were
\cite{Banks:2000fe,fischler2000taking,Fischler:1989se}), that the horizon
entropy of dS space is the maximum entropy that this space can hold.
With this interpretation then, in the limit of the horizon radius
going infinity, the ensuing infinite entropy of Minkowski space, should
also be interpreted as the maximum entropy that this space can contain,
which of course is reasonable. It is not therefore the entropy of
the Minkowski vacuum, which should indeed be zero.

As we will discuss soon, the
same is true of SAdS to SdS (or dS) since the entropy of SAdS is simply
the entropy of the black hole since AdS has no cosmological horizon.

However for large and intermediate black hole masses (as defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:sdstosds} we do not have detailed balance. This is also the situation for the FMP case reviewed in the appendix Sec.~\ref{sec:stods}.



\subsection{Schwarzschild (A)dS to Schwarzschild (A)dS transitions}

Let us now consider the generic case in which the mass parameters $M_{\rm O}$ and $M_{\rm I}$ are non-vanishing. We will then reconsider the forbidden up-lifting configurations and illustrate that in the case $M_{\rm O}\neq 0$ some forbidden transitions become possible. The main reason for this change is the existence of a horizon and the fact that there are two rather than one turning points.

\subsubsection{Black hole to dS - the FGG transition.}

We will start reviewing the original up-tunneling proposal of Farhi, Guth and Guven (FGG) \cite{Farhi:1989yr} and reconsidered in \cite{Fischler:1990pk} in which the background is asymptotically flat Schwarzschild black hole.

The brane tunnels through the
potential and the probability of transition
from the black hole state to the one with a dS space 
is given essentially by the relative probability for being at the
turning point $R_2$ to that of being at the turning point $R_{1}$,
i.e.
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal P}(BH\rightarrow{\cal N)}=\frac{|\Psi(R_2)|^{2}}{|\Psi(R_{1})|^{2}},\label{eq:Pio}
\end{equation}
with $R_{2,1}$ being the right and left turning points.


In the FGG/FMP process we have a transition from a Schwarzschild
black hole to a de Sitter space (adjoined to the hole with a brane
at the junction). The integrals in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Integrals} for $H_{\rm O} = 0$ but $M_{\rm O}\neq 0$ cannot be done analytically but we can approximate them for a small black hole mass. The important point is that  now the background contribution is determined not by the entropy of dS but by the black hole entropy:

\begin{equation}
\bar I=S_{BH}=\frac{\pi R_S^2}{G}=4\pi M_{\rm O}^2 \,.
\end{equation}

Therefore for a small mass black hole $M_{\rm O}<M_{D}\equiv\frac{H^{2}-\kappa^{2}}{2GH^{3}}\simeq\frac{M_{P}^{2}}{H}$
we can neglect the $M_{\rm O}$ dependence in the integrals in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Integrals} and with the background $\bar I$ given as above we have,
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal P}(BH\rightarrow dS)\simeq e^{\frac{\pi}{G}(R_{dS}^{2}-R_{{\rm Schwazchild}}^{2})+2I_{{\rm brane}}}\simeq e^{S_{dS}-S_{BH}} \simeq e^{S_{dS}}\neq 0 \,.\label{eq:bhds}
\end{equation}



The important point is that, contrary to the limit $H_{\rm O} = 0$ for up-tunneling dS to dS which has a vanishing transition rate, now the transition rate from Schwarzschild black hole to dS is non-vanishing even for small values of $M_{\rm O}$.

Note  here the entropy of the final state is much higher than the
black hole entropy, so this is consistent with increasing entropy.



Let us contrast the situation here with that obtained earlier of dS to dS transitions.
In~\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg} we have argued that the FGG/FMP starting configuration is a state with a definite energy (that of the black hole) and that the thermodynamic entropy of the initial state should be identified with the log of the degeneracy of the Hilbert space of the black hole and the background flat space being treated as the Minkowski vacuum identified as a unique state. in contrast to this 
in the dS case it has been argued that its entropy is maximal and indeed is supposed to correspond to the dimension of the Hilbert space that can be accommodated on the horizon. The latter obviously goes to infinity at infinite radius but this should not be confused with the entropy of empty Minkowski space.



\subsection{Schwarzschild AdS to dS}


For Schwarzschild AdS to dS we follow the same steps as FMP did for Schwarzschild to dS. The two turning points $R_{1}, R_{2}$ for which $V=-1$ are in between the dS radius $R_{\rm dS}=1/H_I$ and the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ that is determined by solving the cubic equation:
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm O}^2R_{\mathcal S}^3+R_{\mathcal S}-2GM=0 \,,
\end{equation}
namely
\begin{equation}
R_{\mathcal S}\leq R_{1} < R_{2} \leq R_{\rm dS} \,.
\end{equation}
This can be easily seen by the conditions coming from the expression of the potential at the turning points $\hat A_I=1-H_I^2R^2>0$ implying $R_{2,1}\leq R_{\rm dS}$ and $\hat A_O=1-2GM/R+H_{\rm O}^2R^2 >0$ which by looking at the coefficients determining the single root of  the cubic, it can seen that it implies $R_{\mathcal S}\leq R_{{1, 2}}$.

Also to define the domains for the integration parameter $M$ we compute it first for the case $R'_+=0, V=-1$ which implies gives the value for $M$:
\begin{equation}
M=M_{\rm S} =\frac{H_{\rm O}^2+H_{\rm I}^2+\kappa^2}{2G\left(H_{\rm I}^2+\kappa^2 \right)^{3/2}}, \qquad {\rm for} \qquad R'_+=0, V=-1 \,.
\end{equation}
For the case $R'_-=0, V=-1$ we get
\begin{equation}
M=M_{\rm D}=\frac{H_{\rm O}^2+H_{\rm I}^2-\kappa^2}{2GH_{\rm I}^3},  \qquad {\rm for} \qquad R'_-=0, V=-1 \,.
\end{equation}
Note that for $H_{\rm O}=0$ this reduces to the FMP results as it should. It is also easy to prove that, as in the FMP case, $M_{\rm D}\leq M_{\rm S}$.

Therefore we have the same situation as in the Schwarzschild to dS transition in  which the bulk contribution to the transition rate is determined by:

\begin{eqnarray}
I_{{\rm B}}\bigg|_{\rm tp} \equiv I_{{\rm B}}\bigg|_{R_{{\rm 1}}}^{R_{\rm 2}} =\begin{cases}
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{2}^{2}-R_{{1}}^{2})\,, \qquad & M > M_{\rm S} \,,\label{eq:SB1}\\
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{2}^{2}-R_{\mathcal S}^{2})\,, \qquad & M_{\rm S} > M > M_{\rm D} \,,\label{eq:SB2}\\
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{\rm dS}^{2}-R_{\mathcal S}^{2})\,, \qquad & M_{\rm D} > M \,.\label{eq:SB3}
 \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

The relevant figure for this is the same as in the FMP case i.e. Eq.~\eqref{fig:potentialdS} in the appendix, since both Minkowski and AdS have no cosmological horizons.


As in FMP we are interested in the latest case $M_{\rm D} > M$ to take the small $M$ limit. As in there we may take the limit $M\rightarrow 0$ \footnote{This limit is well defined as long as we stay away from the horizon. The squared curvature tensor is $\propto (GM)^2/R^6$ which goes to zero as $M\rightarrow 0$ unless $R=2GM$.}.

So we have explicitly a non zero transition rate from AdS black hole to dS which is interesting by itself. The interesting questions to ask is how the whole transition rate depends on the values of the parameters $M,H_{\rm I}, H_{\rm O}, \kappa$. In particular if it prefers transitions to smaller or higher values of $H_{\rm I}$ for a fixed $H_{\rm O}$ or viceversa. Also to analyse the transition rate in the extreme cases $H_{\m I,O}\rightarrow M_p$ from below and $M\rightarrow M_p$ from above. This should be done numerically combining the bulk and the wall contributions to the transition rate.



\subsection{Vacuum transitions in quantum gravity and thermodynamics\label{sec:susskind}}

In this subsection we address the interesting points made in \cite{Susskind:2021yvs} regarding the viability of the FGG/FMP process.  Susskind argues that the FGG/FMP process should be forbidden since it violates
what he calls the central dogma  of gravitational systems with horizons
- specifically to de Sitter-like geometries.

\textit{As seen from a causal patch a cosmological space-time can
be described in terms of an isolated quantum system with $\text{{\rm Area}}/4G$
degrees of freedom, which evolves unitarily under time evolution.}

In the next paragraph of that paper the author  assumes that an observer in a causal patch sees a world of finite
entropy satisfying the second law of thermodynamics.

Now, while unitarity of the S-matrix can be shown to lead to the second
law for non-gravitational systems (for a proof see for instance \cite{Weinberg:1995mt}
chapter 3) it is far from clear (and interesting to explore) how to extend this to gravitational
systems particularly transitions where space-time itself changes.
Furthermore there is the notorious problem of time in quantum gravity.
So even though the first statement above holds referring to black holes
in asymptotically flat spacetime (where the notion of a S-matrix may be
formulated) it is far from clear how these statements apply for say
dS space or SdS space. 

Nevertheless Susskind proceeds to conjecture
that they do. Indeed as he says ``The black hole version of this
dogma is, with good reasons, widely accepted. Less is known about
cosmological horizons, so we should consider the cosmological version
to be a conjecture.'' Furthermore referring to the FGG process ``Because
this example involves following a causal patch as it falls behind
a black hole horizon, there may be reasons to be less certain about
the application of the cosmological dogma, but I will assume it is
valid.''

Unlike FGG/FMP who discuss an eternal black hole space-time which
nucleates a spherical wall/brane whose inside is a portion of a dS
space, Susskind's version as presented in section 4, assumes a background
dS space in which a black hole (of mass $M$) is nucleated as a thermal
fluctuation with (Boltzmann) probability $P_{bh}\propto e^{-M/T_{A}}=e^{-2\pi MR_{A}}.$
Here $T_{A}=1/2\pi R_{A}$ is the horizon temperature of the background
dS space. So Susskind's interpretation of FGG is that they predict
an up-tunneling rate for the transition $A\rightarrow B$ (where $B$
is a dS space with smaller horizon radius ($R_{B}<R_{A})$ and hence
smaller entropy) 

\begin{equation}
\bar{\Gamma}_{up}=e^{-2\pi MR_{A}}\Gamma_{FGG} \,.\label{eq:Gammabar}
\end{equation}
On the other hand (according to Susskind) detailed balance requires
the up-tunneling rate to be 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{up}=e^{\S_{B}-\S_{A}}\Gamma_{CDL} \,,\label{eq:upCDL}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_{CDL}$ is the Coleman-DeLuccia down-tunneling rate
and $\S_{A}=\pi R_{A}^{2}/G,\,\S_{B}=\pi R_{B}^{2}/G$. Since $M,\S_{B},\Gamma_{FGG}$
and $\Gamma_{CDL}$ are all independent of $R_{A}$ for $R_{A}\rightarrow\infty$
it was argued that in this regime
\begin{equation}
\frac{\bar{\Gamma}_{up}}{\Gamma_{up}}\approx\frac{\Gamma_{FGG}}{\Gamma_{CDL}e^{\S_{B}}}e^{\S_{A}}\sim e^{\S_{A}} \,,\label{eq:Susskind}
\end{equation}
in violent disagreement with detailed balance.

Several comments are in order:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Hamiltonian calculation of dS$_{A}\rightarrow$ dS$_{B}$ using the
FMP\cite{Fischler:1990pk} formulation gives exactly Eq.~\eqref{eq:upCDL}
\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg} so this quantum mechanical calculation is
not in conflict with detailed balance. In this sense we address the main criticism of Susskind for the process to occur.

\item In the presence of a black hole the issue is more complicated. The
original calculation of FGG and FMP discussed the nucleation of a
brane with a dS space inside it and an asymptotically flat Schwarzschild space outside. Here there are three cases~\cite{Fischler:1990pk}\footnote{Actually there is a discrepancy between FMP and FGG here. The relevant equation in the latter \cite{Farhi:1989yr} is Eq.~(5.34) which is not quite the same as the equations 48 plus 49 of \cite{Fischler:1990pk}. In particular for $M>M_{S}$ FGG gives $I=I_{W}$ whereas FMP give
$I=I_{W}+\frac{\pi}{2G}\left(R_{2}^{2}-R_{1}^{2}\right)$. See appendix
for notation.} as discussed in detail in the appendix  Sec.~\ref{sec:stods}. The first two cases (see Eq.s~\eqref{eq:FMP1}, \eqref{eq:FMP2}) clearly do not satisfy detailed balance, but the third case $M<M_{D}<M_{S}$ gives  Eq.~\eqref{eq:upCDL} \textit{provided} we identify $\S_{A}=\pi R_{S}^{2}/G$ i.e the entropy of a black hole in flat space as the entropy of the initial state. All this assuming also that down tunneling is given by CDL which is only true in the limit where the black hole mass tends to zero.

\item Actually the relevant comparison to the FMP type calculation that should be made is to an SdS to SdS transition as discussed in detail in the Appendix. Here there are also  three cases with the case of small black holes giving Eq.~\eqref{eq:upCDL} with $\S_{A,B}=\frac{\pi}{G}\left(R_{A,B}^{2}+\left(R_{A,B}^{{\rm BH}}\right)^{2}\right)$ with the down tunneling rate modified from CDL to incorporate the black holes. In the limit where the black hole masses go to zero this
is exactly Eq.~\eqref{eq:upCDL}.

\item On the other hand as in the asymptotically flat case there are two other cases (see appendix) corresponding to different ranges of black hole masses,    which do not seem to satisfy detailed balance. The interpretation of these regimes is not clear to us.
\end{itemize}
To summarize: the Hamiltonian calculation shows that  transitions
between space-times with horizons such as dS to dS, and SdS to SdS
with small mass black holes, do satisfy detailed balance and may not be in conflict with Susskind's reasoning. However there
are also cases with large or intermediate mass black holes (as defined in the appendix), that do not satisfy Susskind's central dogma. Since the dogma in the case of tunneling of space-times through barriers, as he himself says, may not apply, this should not be surprising. A proper understanding of the difference of the mass ranges regarding detailed balance would be interesting.

A last comment; from holography it is expected that the empty AdS has zero entropy.  To see this let us consider the eternal AdS black hole~\cite{Maldacena:2001kr}.   Empty AdS can be obtained by taking the mass of the black hole to zero.  Doing this so also the radius, the area and the entropy of the black hole vanish.  If there is a CFT, as in the eternal AdS case, measuring the number of degrees of freedom, of the system,  then these will also  decrease up to the point when there is no black hole and only one state is left which means vanishing entropy.  It will be interesting to further explore this issue.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Brane trajectory after nucleation}
In this section we will study the trajectory of the brane after the nucleation.  We will focus on transitions where the true vacuum is dS.  Following~\cite{Blau:1986cw} the geometry of the brane can be studied by solving the equations for the brane position $\hat{R}$.  For the readers' convenience we repeat the formulae for the brane motion.  The metric on the brane is 
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=-dt^{2}+\hat{R}^{2}(t)d\Omega^{2} \,.\label{eq:brane-metric}
\end{equation}
the first (energy) integral of the equation of motion for the brane is (from now on we will drop the hat on $R$ in this section
since we are just discussing the brane motion),
\begin{equation}
\dot{R}^{2}+V=-1 \,,\label{eq:brane-eom}
\end{equation}
 where the potential may be written as
\begin{equation}
V=-\frac{1}{\left(2\kappa R\right)^{2}}\left(\left(A_{I}-A_{O}\right)+\kappa^{2}R^{2}\right)+A_{I}-1.\label{eq:V1}
\end{equation}
In the case of interest (i.e. AdS black hole to dS), 
\[
A_{I}=1-H_{I}^{2}R^{2},\,\,A_{O}=1-\frac{2GM}{R}+H_{O}^{2}R^{2},
\]
where $H_{I}$ is the inverse of the de Sitter radius and $H_{O}$
is the inverse of the AdS radius.  Substituting these into Eq.~\eqref{eq:V1} we get
\begin{equation}
V=-\frac{R^{2}}{R^{*2}}+\frac{\alpha}{R}-\frac{\beta}{R^{4}} \,,\label{eq:V2}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\alpha=4\left(H_{O}^{2}+H_{I}^{2}-\kappa^{2}\right)\frac{GM}{\left(2\kappa\right)^{2}}\,, \qquad \beta=\frac{\left(2GM\right)^{2}}{\left(2\kappa\right)^{2}}>0 \,,\label{eq:alpha-beta}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{R^{*2}}=\frac{\left(H_{O}^{2}+H_{I}^{2}\right)^{2}+2\kappa^{2}\left(H_{I}^{2}-H_{O}^{2}\right)+\kappa^{4}}{\left(2\kappa\right)^{2}}\,.\label{eq:R*}
\end{equation}
Note that the equation $dV/dR=0$ has only one real root and that
$V\rightarrow-\infty$ for both $R\rightarrow0$ and $R\rightarrow\infty$,
so the potential rises from negative infinity to a maximum below zero
(recall that $V<0$ for all $R$) and then falls back to negative
infinity just as in the BGG case~\cite{Blau:1986cw}. Depending on the value of $M$ we have the three cases discussed earlier.

To compute the motion of the brane in (say) the dS metric inside the
bubble we choose (conformal) global coordinates
\begin{align}
ds^{2} & =\frac{1}{H_{I}^{2}\cos^{2}T}\left(-dT^{2}+dr^{2}+\sin^{2}rd\Omega^{2}\right) \,,\label{eq:global-dS}\\
T_{0} & \le T<\frac{\pi}{2},\,r_{0}\le r<\frac{\pi}{2}\,,\nonumber 
\end{align}
where $T_{0},r_{0}$ are the coordinte time and radius at which the
bubble is nucleated. Embedding the brane metric Eq.~\eqref{eq:brane-metric} in the above we get (denoting $\dot{X}\equiv\frac{dX}{dt}\,X'=\frac{dX}{dr}$),
\begin{align}
T & =T(t),\,r=r(t),\,R=\frac{\sin^{2}r}{H_{I}^{2}\cos^{2}T} \,,\label{eq:embedding1}\\
\dot{T} & =\frac{H_{I}\cos T}{\sqrt{1-r'^{2}}},\,\dot{r}=\frac{H_{I}\cos T}{\sqrt{1-r'^{2}}}r' \,.\label{eq:embedding2}
\end{align}
We also have
\begin{align*}
\dot{R} & =\frac{\partial R}{dT}\dot{T}+\frac{\partial R}{dr}\dot{r}=\frac{\dot{T}}{H_{I}}\left(\tan T\sec T\sin r+\frac{dr}{dT}\sec T\cos r\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-r'^{2}}}\left(\tan T\sin r+r'\cos r\right) \,.
\end{align*}
Hence using Eq.s~\eqref{eq:brane-eom}, \eqref{eq:V2} and \eqref{eq:embedding1}
we have 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-r'^{2}}}\left(\sin T\sin r+r'\cos r\cos T\right)=\sqrt{\frac{\sin^{2}r}{H_{I}^{2}R^{*2}}-\alpha H_{I}\frac{\cos^{3}T}{\sin r}+\beta H_{I}^{4}\frac{\cos^{6}T}{\sin^{4}r}-\cos^{2}T} \,.\label{eq:brane-eom2}
\end{equation}
The small black hole regime may be defined as $\alpha H_{I}\ll1,\,\beta H_{I}^{4}\ll1.$
In the limit $M\rightarrow0$ this obviously tends to the formal AdS
to dS result.

Note that as $T\rightarrow\pi/2$ (i.e. in the infinite future) we
get $\sqrt{1-r'^{2}}=H_{I}R^{*}\ne0$. i.e. the brane speed does not
reach the speed of light, as in the BGG case. 




As is now well known \cite{Cespedes:2020xpn},  in the case of dS/dS transition,  the wall after nucleation follows a geodesic in $SO(3,1)$.  This has been to argued that the the spacetime after the foliation is open since it fits naturally with the picture of the wall never crossing the horizon.  The argument for the wall trajectory relied heavily in the fact that the tangent acceleration  in the dS/dS  case is always constant.  Here we show that adding a mass to the exterior vacuum changes this pictures allowing for different trajectories of the wall.  First,  let us note that the acceleration of the wall can be computed from the junction conditions to be~\cite{Blau:1986cw},
\begin{align}
K_{\tau\tau}=-\frac{\ddot R-H^2 R}{\sqrt{1-H^2R^2+\dot R^2}} \,,
\end{align}
whose value can be inferred by solving the potential equation for the junction conditions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:EofM}.
In the case of dS/dS,  the solution can be obtained analytically,  $R=R_0\cosh(t/R_0)$ and the acceleration is constant.  In  general when there is a mass this does not hold,  and we find that the acceleration is given by
\begin{align}
-K_{\tau\tau}=\frac{\frac{(1-H_0^2 R_*^2)}{R_0^2}-\frac{\alpha }{2R(\tau)^3}-\frac{2\beta }{R(\tau)^6}}{\sqrt{\frac{(1-H_0^2 R_*^2)}{R_0^2}-\frac{\alpha }{R(\tau)^3}-\frac{\beta }{R(\tau)^6}}} \,,
\end{align}
where we have used the equation of motion. $\dot R^2+V=-1$,  Expanding for small $\alpha H_I$ and $\beta H_I^4$,  we can write the LHS as,
\begin{align}
\frac{\ddot R-H^2 R}{\sqrt{1-H^2R^2+\dot R^2}}=\frac{\sqrt{1-H_0^2 R_*^2}}{R_*}-\frac{R_*}{\sqrt{1-H_0 R_*^2}}\left(\frac{\alpha}{R^3}-\frac{5}{2}\frac{\beta}{R^6}+\mathcal{O}(R_0^3\alpha^2/R^6)\right) \,.
\end{align}
From this we see that for small radius the wall initially  accelerates/decelerates until $R(\tau)$ grows large enough such that the acceleration asymptotes to a constant.  Notice that in the case that the mass in the outer region is zero both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are zero in which case the acceleration is always constant as we anticipated.  Another feature is that this results do not depend on the outer region being SdS or AdS and hence this is a feature of the outside region having a mass. 

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.55,trim=2.1cm 8cm 1cm 5cm,clip]{WallTrajectoryb.pdf}
\caption{\footnotesize{Penrose diagram of the wall trajectory. The green line is the solution in the case of $\alpha=.11H$, $\beta= 0.0014 H^4$, $R_*=0.55 H$.  The black line corresponds to the case whe $M=0$ annd $R_*=0.55 H$.  Note that the green line crosses the dotted line meaning that the wall crosses the horizon of the De Sitter observer } \label{fig:WallTrajectory}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
One of the consequences of the change of acceleration is that the wall can now enter into the comoving horizon of an observer on one of the hemispheres.  

This was shown by writing the radius of the wall in global coordinates $R(T)=a(T)\sin(r(T)$ as above.
 We plot the solutions to Eq.~\eqref{eq:brane-eom2} where we can see that for certain values of $\alpha$ the wall indeed crosses the lightcone $r=T$ as can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:WallTrajectory}.  Clearly this is due to the fact that the worldsheet of the trajectory  only has $O(3)$ symmetry and hence it is not so restricted as in the dS/dS case.  This implies that there might well be other trajectories which cross the horizon from the other hemisphere.  Using Euclidean arguments \cite{Coleman:1980aw} it was suggested that the interior region had an open de Sitter geometry.  Even though it can be argued in the dS/dS case that this holds naturally since such foliation never crosses the horizon and thus the wall remains outside the lightcone, we see that when including the mass this argument does not hold.  From Lorentzian arguments there is no preferred foliation as the whole computation only assumes $O(3)$ symmetry (see also~\cite{Cespedes:2020xpn, Cespedes:2021oso}).  Thus in order to determine the curvature of the nucleated spacetime one would have to work out the consequences having a wall,  for instance,  the effects of a wall induced anisotropy. 


A possible probe of the wall would be to compute the maximum correlation function that lies within the interior de Sitter spacetime.  The correlation function on de Sitter for a massless field evaluated at equal times but at two  different points $(\rho_1,\Omega_1,\rho_2,\Omega_2)$  is given by~\cite{Allen:1987tz},
\begin{align}
G(\rho_1,\Omega_1,\rho_2,\Omega_2)\sim H^2\left(\frac{1}{1-Z}-\log(1-Z)\right) \,,
\label{correlation_function}
\end{align}
where $Z$ is the geodesic length between two points,  $Z=H^{2}\eta_{ab}X^a(r,\Omega)X^b(r',\Omega')$.  Since we are interested in correlation functions with $O(3)$ symmetry we have that $\Omega=\Omega'$,  and we get that
\begin{align}
1-Z=\sec(T)^2(1-\cos(r-r')) \,.
\end{align}
From this we see that the log dominates over the first term in the correlation function. 
Now, when the wall lies behind the lightcone the maximum value of $1-Z$  is when $\rho-\rho'=\pi/2$ in which case the correlation function becomes,
\begin{align}
G(r)\sim H^2\log(\sec(T))\sim H^3 t \,,
\end{align}
where in the last line we have used that $\sec(T)=\cosh(H t)\sim e^{H t}$.  Of course this is the usual covariance of a massless field that grows linearly with time until the end of inflation $t_e$.  Now in the presence of the wall,  if we write $r-r'=\pi/2-\Delta r$ for $\alpha$ small we get that the correlation function behaves as,
\begin{align}
G(r)\sim H^2\log(\sec(T)(1-\cos r))\sim H^2(H t+\Delta r/2+\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)) \,,
\end{align}
which means  however that any effect of the wall is washed away by the expansion.  Still, since inflation is not eternal there is a lower bound on which scales can be access by an observer without noticing the wall.  For instance the largest distance on the CMB can be estimated from  the comoving distance to the CMB dipole to be $\chi_L\sim.46$.  This would put a lower bound on the maximum size of $\rho$ without detecting a wall.  Notice that there could still be effects from higher order correlation functions and/or on the analytical properties of the correlation function that we leave for future study. 


On the other end we have the case when the false vacuum $\vert H_0\vert\to\infty$. This, we have identified as  having the same transition rate that Hartle-Hawking (or Vilenkin-Linde) in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nothingrate}.  We can see from Eq.~\eqref{eq:R*} that this limit corresponds to the turning point radius  $R^*\to 0$.  This happens because when $\vert H_0\vert$ grows the potential  moves towards the origin becoming  and narrower around $R=0$ so that the barrier becomes infinitely thin in the limit. This explains why there is no exponential suppression in this limit. 


We mentioned before that the up-tunneling transition rate is similar to tunneling from nothing.  However,  from the previous discussion we can see that there is a key difference.  As indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:nothing} the  nucleated spacetime is not the whole de Sitter but only  a portion that includes  the whole  causal lightcone of an observer on the hemisphere of the true vacuum. There is also another small region outside the lightcone where the spacetime ends.  This starts at $r=M_{\mathrm{UV}}$ where $r$ is the radial direction in global coordinates and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}$ is the cut-off of the theory.  The reason why the spacetime starts  there is because we are still demanding the spacetime to be a solution of the junction conditions, then in the limit we are considering, the trajectory has to satisfy the geodesic equation $\cos(r)=\sqrt{1-H_0^2 R_0^2}\cos T$.  Notice that when $R_0=0$ the equations are singular. This is addressed by noticing that  $R_0$ becomes asymptotically small but  we still require that $R_0\geq 1/M_{\mathrm{UV}} $ in order for the EFT to still be valid. 


This solution is actually similar to the Hawking-Turok instanton~\cite{Hawking:1998bn},  which is an Euclidean solution that gives rise to  an open universe (see however \cite{Bousso:1998ed}),  and whose wavefunction is the same as in Hartle-Hawking\footnote{The fact that up-tunneling from an infinite AdS potential corresponds to the Turok-Hawking instanton has been discussed before, \textit{eg.}\cite{Garriga:1999xh, Brown:2011gt}, although \cite{Brown:2011gt} concluded that this up-tunneling transition was not possible unlike our findings here.}.\\

\end{center} 
\end{figure}

Notice however that our solutions differ.  Our method is Lorentzian and then we do not need to consider singular instantons, moreover the solution can also be interpreted as the  Vilenkin-Linde wave function, although in that case, as opposed to Hartle-Hawking,  it does not satisfy detailed balance.

\section{Conclusions}





In this paper we have continued our program (see \cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg},  \cite{Cespedes:2020xpn} and \cite{Pasquarella:2022ibb}) of reformulating vacuum transitions in the Hamiltonian framework generalising the seminal work of FMP~\cite{Fischler:1990pk}. FMP considered Schwarzschild to dS transitions in the limit $M\rightarrow 0$. The dS to dS transition was studied in detail in \cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp},\cite{DeAlwis:2019rxg}. Here we have extended these works by including explicit expressions for the transition rates in all values and signs of the cosmological constants $\Lambda_A, \Lambda_B$  and all values of the black hole mass $M$. Notice that the cosmological constants are input parameters of the theory whereas the black hole mass appears as an integration constant which should be included in gravitational configurations with  spherical symmetry. 
\vskip 1mm

In general we find that for generic values of these parameters the transition rates are non-vanishing, including up-tunneling  from AdS to dS spacetimes. These non-vanishing transition rates can give rise to a huge network of vacua connected by quantum transitions among each other. This is  relevant to understand the structure and population of the string landscape.
\vskip 1mm

In the general case, the contributions to the transition rate coming from the wall is only written in terms of integrals that are only possible to solve analytically in special limits (like $M\rightarrow 0$). However the ratio of up to down tunneling is such that these contributions cancel and it gives a very simple result. This ratio allows us to verify that detailed balance is satisfied in many of the cases. In particular, due to the nature of the Hamiltonian prescription, the transition rates do not determine the sign $\eta=\pm 1$. By comparison with the standard wave function of the universe, we claim that this sign arbitrariness corresponds to the same sign arbitrariness that differentiates the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin probability amplitudes. In this sense we find detailed balance to work for the Hartle-Hawking but not Vilenkin. This may not be surprising since the initial conditions for the Vilenkin wave function select the expanding universe brach of the wave function of the universe which is clearly not and equilibrium situation so it's no surprise that detailed balance is not satisfied.
\vskip 1mm

Having computed the general transition rates we were able to  consider  different limits for $\Lambda_A, \Lambda_B$ and $M$. We find some interesting results. In particular for studying a transition from Minkowski spacetime we may describe Minkowski starting from several directions. First by setting $\Lambda_A=0$ to start with and take the decay rate in the $M\rightarrow 0$ limit as FMP did. This gives the finite transition rate obtained in FMP. Second, we may start with $M=0$ and consider the dS to dS transition and then take the limit $\Lambda_A\rightarrow 0$. This gives a zero transition rate $\Gamma\sim e^{-3/\Lambda_A}\rightarrow 0$. Third, we can start with the AdS to dS transition and take the limit $\Lambda_A\rightarrow 0$ which in this case reproduces the non-vanishing FMP result which is reassuring. 
\vskip 1mm

We argued that the $\Lambda_A\rightarrow 0$ limit is a more reliable definition of the Minkowski vacuum, if we start from AdS rather than from dS. In some sense AdS is  closer to Minkowski  since both are non-compact and  horizonless. Actually the SdS to SdS transitions require a more detailed analysis as discussed in the appendix, precisely because of the richer horizon structure. We offered several explanations for the difference among the limits. One is related to entropy: the dS entropy still needs to be better understood but it may be interpreted in terms of the fact that from the perspective of an observer dS is not a pure state since there are degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to the observer. On taking the $\Lambda_A\rightarrow 0$ limit the horizon moves to the surface at infinity. So it seems that  taking the limit the two entangled static patches of dS  then give rise to two disconnected but entangled Minkowski spacetimes and therefore the apparent infinite entropy. Clearly this subject needs a better understanding.
\vskip 1mm


Another interesting limit is the $\Lambda_A\rightarrow -\infty $. In this case our general expression for AdS to dS gives us a transition rate that is exactly the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin probabilities for the creation of dS from nothing. This result fits nicely with the Brown-Dahlen proposal for understanding nothing (of the bubble of nothing) in terms of this AdS limit. However they had concluded that the transition was not allowed and therefore questioned the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin results. Here we actually find perfect agreement between two independent calculations and provide then a strong case for this interpretation. We find this result remarkable. In general the limit $\Lambda_A\rightarrow -\infty $ should not be trusted since it brings us beyond the validity of effective field theory. The proper limit to take is to compare $\Lambda_A$ with the other scales of the system, like the brane tension $\kappa$ and the dS cosmological constant $\Lambda_B$ and consider the regime $|\Lambda_A| \gg  \Lambda_B, \kappa^2, M^2$. In this case we obtain again the Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin probability at leading order plus corrections of order
$\Lambda_B/|\Lambda_A \ll 1$, $ M^2/|\Lambda_A| \ll 1$ and $\kappa^2/|\Lambda_A| \ll 1$. 
\vskip 1mm 

Note, however that our identification of the nucleated spacetime fits with the Hawking-Turok instanton (and its open universe interpretation) rather than the creation of a full closed spacetime as in the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin cases. Since the transition rate in both cases is the same, we may conjecture that also for these cases there is a non-vanishing probability to create AdS and Minkowski spacetimes if we assign vanishing entropies to these spaces. Clearly this needs to be better understood.
\vskip 1mm 


Finally we may consider the regime in which the black hole mass dominates ($M\gg \Lambda_A, \Lambda_B$). This is a much less understood limit that may need further study. In particular, unlike the small mass limit, the ratio of up and down transition rates does not give exponential of the entropies. Instead of entropies we find differences of areas that do not correspond to horizon areas. It may be tempting to speculate these are some generalised entropies but we do not yet have a proper interpretation.
\vskip 1mm

Regarding the trajectory of the wall for the generic $M\neq 0$ case, we find it interesting that it does not correspond to a geodesic that favours the open slicing of dS, contrary to the $M=0$ case. This leaves open the question if an open universe is a general implication of the bubble nucleation process.
\vskip 1mm
Some approaches to the address the cosmological constant problem envisage the landscape transitions to Minkowski or near Minkowski (with positive but tiny cosmological constants) and with AdS being a terminal  spacetime  (for recent discussions see \cite{Giudice:2021viw,Kartvelishvili:2020thd,Friedrich:2022tqk}).  It would be interesting to explore what will be the implications that up-tunellling from AdS could have to those proposals.
\\
There are many questions still open. Extending the Hamiltonian approach to include scalar field potentials is a totally open question. An AdS/CFT interpretation of our results may be interesting, following the lines of  \cite{Maldacena:2010un} that interpreted the CDL Minkowski to AdS transition holographically. Furthermore \cite{Pasquarella:2022ibb} proposed interesting holographic interpretations for the 2D transitions. Extensions of these ideas to the 4D systems considered here may be worth exploring.
\vskip 1mm

Clearly our results leave  plenty of issues still to be understood. But we hope that our work and the questions we raised may guide future progress in this area.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}

The development of cosmic inflation~\cite{Guth:1980zm, Linde:1981mu, Albrecht:1982wi} to solve some of the issues of the standard Big Bang theory and as a mechanism to generate the primordial perturbations observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has been one of the most striking results of cosmology during the last decades \cite{Baumann:2009ds, Akrami:2018odb}. In its simplest implementation, i.e. in single field models, inflation can in principle account for all observations. Specific single field models have been increasingly constrained over the years: some of the simplest models such as power-law inflation~\cite{Linde:1983gd} are now strongly disfavoured and - in general - models featuring concave potentials are favoured with respect to those with convex potentials~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}. 

However, it is reasonable to expect that the single field description of inflation is valid only approximately as in principle there may be many fields that couple to the inflaton and be dynamical during inflation. For instance, UV complete theories like string theory give rise, upon compactification, to hundreds of complex scalar fields in the low-energy 4D theory whose dynamics can be crucial during inflation. Moreover, as typical of supergravity models, the resulting field space is curved. Notice that, in a gravitational context, theories with a curved field space and non-trivial kinetic interactions are not just a feature of string theory but generically arise in non-minimally coupled multifield effective models, upon moving to Einstein frame~\cite{Kaiser:2010ps,Kaiser:2012ak, Schutz:2013fua, DiMarco:2002eb}. 

Some of these scalars might acquire a very large mass and decouple completely from the inflationary dynamics. However several of them are expected to remain light and to play an important role during inflation. A primary example are axion-like fields which are naturally light since they enjoy a shift symmetry which is broken only at non-perturbative level. Again, a typical string compactification is characterised by hundreds of them, leading to the so-called string axiverse~\cite{Svrcek:2006yi, Conlon:2006tq, Arvanitaki:2009fg, Cicoli:2012sz}. Therefore in string models, and more generally in non-minimally coupled effective theories, it is very natural to have light kinetically coupled fields during inflation, that in principle cannot be decoupled from the inflationary dynamics. It becomes then crucial to study the effect of these isocurvature modes on the inflationary dynamics, to understand if they can modify or even spoil inflation, depending on their observational signatures.

The choice of entropy variables to describe the effect of isocurvature modes in multifield models of inflation is clearly fundamental. Several variables have been proposed so far in the literature, with different pros and cons. In this paper we will discuss the usefulness and theoretical consistency of each of these entropy variables, clarifying which is the one more suitable to perform a proper matching between the inflationary and the post-inflationary evolution of isocurvature perturbations. This matching is crucial to make contact with data since CMB observations place constraints on the primordial isocurvature fraction only at the time of CMB decoupling. Let us summarise our analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planck measurements constrain the primordial isocurvature fraction parameter defined as $\beta_{\rm iso}(k) = P_{S_{n\gamma}}(k)/ [P_\zeta(k) + P_{S_{n\gamma}}(k)]$, where $\zeta$ is the standard curvature perturbation on uniform-density hypersurfaces, while $S_{n\gamma}$ is the relative entropy perturbation between photons and a different species denoted with $n$ which can be cold dark matter, baryons or neutrinos. The upper bound on this fraction goes from about $1\%$ to $10\%$ depending on the species involves and the momentum scale \cite{Akrami:2018odb}.

\item The correct entropy variable to be studied during inflation seems therefore $S_{ij}$, where now $i$ and $j$ are indices denoting different fields (or combinations thereof) of the underlying multifield models. The evolution of $S_{ij}$ during inflation should be matched with the post-inflationary history of our universe, leading to $S_{n\gamma}$, once a proper understanding of the model-dependent reheating epoch is developed \cite{Polarski:1994rz, Langlois:1999dw}. This involves the knowledge of how photons, cold dark matter, baryons and neutrinos are produced from the decay of the different microscopic degrees of freedom. This study has been recently carried out in flat field spaces \cite{Martin:2021frd} but the extension of this formalism to curved systems is still missing. 

\item There are some particular cases where however the relative entropy variable $S_{ij}$ becomes ill-defined since it would apparently diverge. This might occur in general in multifield models where the kinetic energy of some scalar fields vanishes \cite{Wands:2000dp} as in situations with a curved field space and light spectator fields \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr, Cicoli:2019ulk} since $S_{ij}\sim \left(\frac{\delta\rho_j}{\dot\rho_j} - \frac{\delta\rho_i}{\dot\rho_i}\right) \to \infty$ due to $\dot\rho_i\to 0$ (where $\rho_i$ is the energy density of the $i$-th scalar field, $\delta\rho_i$ is its perturbation and $\dot\rho_i \equiv d\rho_i/dt$).

\item We will show that this divergence is unphysical since no geometrical destabilisation \cite{Renaux-Petel:2015mga} of the background trajectory is induced by the spurious growing isocurvature perturbations. In fact, we will argue that in this case a better entropy variable which should be used is $\hat{S}_{ij}\propto \dot\rho_i\dot\rho_j S_{ij}$ which remains well-behaved and decreases with respect to standard adiabatic perturbations. In these `pathological' cases it is therefore the evolution of $\hat{S}_{ij}$, and not the one of $S_{ij}$, which should be studied during inflation. Matching with the beginning of radiation dominance will then lead to $\hat{S}_{n\gamma}$ which can be safely translated into $S_{n\gamma}$ to compare with observational data since $S_{n\gamma}$ is a well-defined quantity with no divergence.

\item Another entropy variable which is sometimes used is the total entropy defined in terms of the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation $\delta P_{\rm nad}$ as $S = \left(H/\dot P\right)\delta P_{\rm nad}$. This quantity, even if used in some cases \cite{Huston:2011fr, Huston:2013kgl}, contains both intrinsic and relative entropy contributions, and so it is not the right one to be used to compare with observational bounds on $\beta_{\rm iso}$.

\item The non-adiabatic perturbation $\delta s$, introduced for the first time in \cite{Gordon:2000hv} and then used extensively in many studies (see for example \cite{Achucarro:2010da, Cremonini:2010sv}), corresponds instead to fluctuations which are orthogonal to the classical background trajectory. The entropy variable $\delta s$ is very useful to picture clearly the decomposition of an arbitrary perturbation into adiabatic (tangent) and entropy (normal) components, and it allows for an easier numerical integration of the field equations. However it is not the right variable to compare with observations since it can lead to results which are wrong by several orders of magnitude since $\delta s$ is proportional to total entropy \cite{Huston:2011fr, Huston:2013kgl, Wands:2002bn}. Moreover, in a curved field space, the use of $\delta s$ can lead to apparent destabilisation effects which are unphysical. This effect can be seen in the behaviour of the effective mass-squared $m_{\rm eff}^2$ of isocurvature perturbations $\delta s$ which receives different contributions from derivatives of the scalar potential, the curvature of the field space and the turning rate of the background trajectory. Depending on the form of the kinetic coupling and the underlying scalar potential, there are 3 general situations: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multifield models featuring a geometrical destabilisation \cite{Renaux-Petel:2015mga} induced by the negative curvature of the field space that causes a tachyonic effective mass \cite{Gong:2011uw} which however turns into $m_{\rm eff}^2>0$ once the system settles down in the classical background trajectory \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr, Christodoulidis:2019mkj}. In this case both $S_{ij}$ and $\delta s$ would decay since the isocurvature modes are heavy (even if $S_{ij}$ is the right variable to study to get to the final prediction for $\beta_{\rm iso}$ after reheating).

\item Multifield models with a non-vanishing turning rate \cite{Achucarro:2016fby} characterised by $m_{\rm eff}^2\simeq 0$ due to cancellation between different contributions even if the background field can be heavy (i.e. the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the scalar potential are non-zero). In this case isocurvature modes are constant on super-horizon scales and act as a source for curvature perturbations. Thus $\beta_{\rm iso}$ is expected to be negligible in this class of models which can qualitatively be well-described both in terms of $S_{ij}$ and $\delta s$, even if one should focus on $S_{ij}$ to pin down the exact prediction for $\beta_{\rm iso}$.

\item Multifield models typical of string compactifications where the inflaton is a K\"ahler modulus \cite{Conlon:2005jm, Cicoli:2008gp, Burgess:2010bz, Cicoli:2011ct, Cicoli:2012cy, Cicoli:2016chb, Cicoli:2016xae, Cicoli:2017axo, Cicoli:2020bao} and ultra-light axions play the role of spectator fields. In the case of Fibre Inflation \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, as shown in \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk}, when using the entropy variable $\delta s$, the effective mass of these isocurvature modes would become tachyonic due to the negative contribution coming from the curvature of the underlying field space, i.e. $m_{\rm eff}^2<0$. This might signal an exponential growth of isocurvature modes leading the system to a regime where perturbation theory breaks down. However the background trajectory of these multifield models turns out to be fully stable \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk}. The absence of any instability seems therefore to be a paradox. This is resolved by noticing that the variable $\delta s$ is ill-defined in this case since the divergence arises from the behaviour of the vector normal to the background trajectory which is used to decompose an arbitrary perturbation to define $\delta s$. In fact, when using the relative entropy variable $\hat{S}_{ij}$, we will find that in this case non-adiabatic perturbations decay on super-horizon scales, in full agreement with the absence of any destabilisation of the background trajectory. 
\end{enumerate}

\item As we will show for the general case of a curved field space, the different entropy variables, $S$, $S_{ij}$, $\hat{S}_{ij}$ and $\delta s$, are all gauge invariant. Thus the apparent instability for cases with light kinetically coupled spectator fields where both $S_{ij}$ and $\delta s$ diverge, is not due to the use of a non-physical variable which is not gauge invariant, but it is simply due to the fact that in these particular cases those variables become ill-defined.
\end{itemize} 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:EntropyPerturbations} we discuss different variables used in the literature to describe entropy perturbations in multifield inflationary models, stressing which is the right variable to consider to perform a proper matching between inflation and the reheating epoch. In Sec. \ref{sec:SpuriousInstability} we show how some entropy variables can become ill-defined in models with kinetically coupled spectator fields which are lighter than the inflaton. Focusing on a simple 2-field system with a Starobinsky-like inflationary potential, we investigate the origin of the spurious instability and we then show that, using the appropriate entropy variable, the isocurvature power spectrum turns out to be negligible. We draw our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusions} and we leave some technical details to the appendices. In particular, in App. \ref{AppA} we first present the general framework of perturbation theory for a curved field space (focusing on the spatially flat gauge), and we then prove gauge invariance of all entropy variables. App. \ref{sec:singlefield} provides instead the details of the single field limit of density perturbations for our illustrative 2-field model.


\section{Entropy variables in multifield inflation}
\label{sec:EntropyPerturbations}

In this section we clarify the relations between the various definitions of entropy that can be found in the literature, in an effort to understand how the entropy perturbations generated during multifield inflation are then transferred to the primordial plasma in the radiation phase.

\subsection{Entropy perturbations during inflation}
\label{sec:PerturbationsDuringInflation}

Let us start with the multifield Lagrangian of a generic non-linear sigma model which can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{L}}{\sqrt{|g|}}=\frac12\, G_{ij}(\phi^i)\partial_\mu \phi^i \partial^\mu \phi^j-V(\phi^i)\,,
\label{eq:L}
\end{equation}
where $G_{ij}(\phi^i)$ denotes the field space metric. As already mentioned, this class of models naturally arises in the framework of beyond the Standard Model theories as string compactifications, supergravity and non-minimally coupled multifield effective theories. 

To make contact with the entropy $S$, let us recall that for a generic fluid the pressure $P$ is a function of $S$ and the energy density $\rho$: $P=P(\rho,S)$. Pressure perturbations can therefore be decomposed into an adiabatic and a non-adiabatic part, according to:
\begin{equation}
\delta P= \frac{\delta P}{\delta \rho}\Big |_S \delta \rho+ \frac{\delta P}{\delta S}\Big|_\rho \delta S\,.
\end{equation}
The adiabatic pressure perturbation is $\delta P_{\rm ad}=c_s^2\, \delta\rho$, with a speed of sound $c_s^2\equiv \dot{P}/\dot{\rho}$. The non-adiabatic pressure perturbation, denoted $\delta P_{\rm nad}$, is formally given by $\delta P_{\rm nad}=\left(\dot{P}/\dot{S}\right)\delta S$, and is in practice computed by subtracting the adiabatic from the total pressure perturbation: 
\begin{equation}
\delta P_{\rm nad}=\delta P- \delta P_{\rm ad}\,.
\label{eq:Pnad}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Total entropy}

The total entropy perturbation can be defined in terms of the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation $\delta P_{\rm nad}$ as:
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{H}{\dot{P}}\,\delta P_{\rm nad}=\frac{H}{\dot{P}}\left(\delta P- c_s^2 \delta \rho\right).
\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}
During inflation, when scalar fields dominate the energy content of the Universe, one may write the total entropy of the system in terms of $\phi^i$ and $\delta\phi^i$ and their derivatives. In the case of multifield inflation in a generic curved field space (\ref{eq:S}) becomes (setting $M_p=1$):
\begin{equation} 
S=-\frac{H}{3H\dot\phi^i\dot\phi_i+2\dot\phi^i V_i}\,\delta P_{\rm nad}\,,
\label{TotS}
\end{equation}
where in the spatially flat gauge $\delta P_{\rm nad}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\delta P_{\rm nad}=-2 V_i \delta \phi^i + \frac{V_i \dot{\phi}^i \delta\phi_j \dot{\phi}^j}{3H^2} -\frac{2}{3H}\frac{V_\ell \dot{\phi}^\ell}{\dot{\phi}_m \dot{\phi}^m}\left[\dot{\phi}_i \delta\dot{\phi}^i +\frac12 \dot{\phi}^i \dot{\phi}^j \partial_k G_{ij} \delta \phi^k +V_i \delta\phi^i \right].
\end{equation}
In App. \ref{AppA} we have shown that the variable $S$ is gauge invariant not just for canonical fields but also for the case of a curved field space.

\subsubsection*{Intrinsic entropy}

For a given fluid $i$ one can define the intrinsic entropy perturbation $S_{{\rm int},i}$ as \cite{Malik:2004tf}:
\begin{equation}
S_{{\rm int},i}=\frac{H}{\dot{P}}\left(\delta P_i- c_i^2 \delta \rho_i\right),
\label{eq:Sint}
\end{equation}
so that the total intrinsic entropy perturbation of a system with multiple components is:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm int}=\sum_i S_{{\rm int},i}\,.
\label{eq:Srel0}
\end{equation}
Notice that $S_{{\rm int},i}=0$ for fluids for which $P_i=P_i(\rho_i)$ and that $S_{\rm int}$ is also a gauge invariant quantity (see again App. \ref{AppA}).
 
\subsubsection*{Relative entropy}

One can also define the relative entropy perturbation as:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm rel}=S-S_{\rm int}\,.
\end{equation}
Noting that $\delta P= \sum_i \delta P_i$ and that $\delta \rho= \sum_i \delta \rho_i$ and making use of \eqref{eq:S}, \eqref{eq:Sint} and \eqref{eq:Srel0} one may write \cite{Malik:2004tf}:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\rm rel}&=& \frac{H}{\dot{P} \dot{\rho}}\sum_{ij}c^2_i \left(\dot{\rho}_j \delta \rho_i-\dot{\rho}_i \delta \rho_j\right) \nonumber \\
&=&-\frac{1}{6 \dot{\rho}\dot{P}}\sum_{ij} \dot{\rho}_i \dot{\rho}_j \left(c_i^2-c_j^2\right)S_{ij} \,,
\label{eq:Sreldef}
\end{eqnarray}
where in the last line we have introduced the standard definition of entropy perturbation between two fluids:
\begin{equation}
S_{ij}\equiv\zeta_i-\zeta_j=-3 H \left(\frac{\delta \rho_i}{\dot{\rho}_i}-\frac{\delta \rho_j}{\dot{\rho}_j}\right),
\label{eq:Sab}
\end{equation}
as is commonly found in the context of hot Big Bang cosmology, and have defined the individual fluid speed of sound as $c_i^2=\dot{P}_i/\dot{\rho}_i$. Notice that, since the curvature perturbation on uniform $\rho_i$ hypersurfaces, $\zeta_i=-\Psi-H \delta\rho_i/\dot{\rho}_i$ is a gauge invariant quantity (see App. \ref{AppA} for the definition of $\Psi$, the scalar spatial perturbation to the metric tensor, and a proof of gauge invariance for scalar non-linear sigma models), $S_{ij}$ is automatically gauge invariant, even in the presence of energy transfer between the fluids \cite{Malik:2002jb,Malik:2004tf}.

It is worth pointing out that $S_{ij}$ becomes ill-defined when $\dot\rho_i\to 0$ in multifield models with vanishing kinetic energy for some scalar fields \cite{Wands:2000dp} as it occurs in classes of string inflationary models with ultra-light axions \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr, Cicoli:2019ulk}. In this case we consider an `improved' relative entropy variable $\hat{S}_{ij}$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{S}_{ij} \equiv -\frac{1}{6 \dot{\rho}\dot{P}} \dot{\rho}_i \dot{\rho}_j \left(c_i^2-c_j^2\right)S_{ij}\qquad \Rightarrow\qquad S_{\rm rel} = \sum_{ij}\hat{S}_{ij}\,.
\label{hatSij}
\end{equation}
Clearly $\hat{S}_{ij}$ remains finite even if $\dot\rho_i\to 0$. 

\subsubsection*{Entropy field}

In order to introduce an alternative description of adiabatic and entropy perturbations, it is convenient to define the tangent and normal vectors to the inflationary trajectory. Focusing for simplicity on a 2-dimensional field space, these are given in terms of the background velocities as \cite{Achucarro:2010da,Cremonini:2010sv}:
\begin{equation}
T^i\equiv \frac{\dot\phi^i}{\dot\phi_0}\qquad\text{and}\qquad N^i=\frac{s_N(t)}{\sqrt{G_{jk} D_t T^j D_t T^k}}\, D_t T^i\,,
\label{eq:TN}
\end{equation}
with $\dot\phi_0\equiv\sqrt{G_{ij}\,\dot\phi^i\,\dot\phi^j}$ and $D_t T^i=\dot T^i +\Gamma_{jk}^i T^j\dot\phi^k$, where $\Gamma$ is the field space metric connection and $s_N(t)=\pm1$ accounts for the relative orientation between the normal direction and $\dot T^i$. These two projectors are orthogonal to each other and have unit norm with respect to the scalar product defined with the metric $G_{ij}$. In the context of inflationary physics, adiabatic and entropy perturbations can be characterised in terms of the gauge invariant quantities (see App. \ref{AppA}): 
\begin{equation}
\delta \sigma= T^i \,\delta \phi_i\qquad \text{and}\qquad\delta s= N^i\, \delta \phi_i\,,
\label{deltas}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the so-called `adiabatic field', while $s$ is the `entropy field' \cite{Gordon:2000hv}. These can be related to the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations as (in the spatially flat gauge) \cite{Achucarro:2010da}:
\begin{equation}
\zeta=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\,\delta \sigma\qquad\text{and}\qquad \tilde{S}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\,\delta s\,,
\label{eq:RSTN}
\end{equation}
where $2\epsilon = \left(\dot\phi_0/H\right)^2$. Notice that the entropy direction $\delta s$ can be directly related to the total entropy on super-horizon scales as \cite{Gordon:2000hv}:
\begin{equation}
S\simeq - \frac{2 V_N}{3\dot\phi_0^2}\, \delta s = - \frac{2 V_N}{3\dot\phi_0 H}\, \tilde S\,.
\label{Sds}
\end{equation}
Moreover, as shown in App. \ref{AppA}, in a 2-field system with a diagonal field space metric with $G_{ii} \equiv G_i$ for $i=1,2$, $\delta s$ takes the simple expression:
\begin{equation}
\delta s  = \sqrt{G_1 G_2} \left(\frac{\dot{\phi^1} \dot{\phi^2}}{\dot\phi_0}\right) \delta\phi^{12} \,,
\label{eq:deltas}
\end{equation}
where $\delta\phi^{12}$ is a gauge invariant quantity called `generalised entropy' in \cite{Gordon:2000hv} and defined as:
\begin{equation}
\delta \phi^{12}\equiv\frac{\delta \phi^1}{\dot{\phi}^1}-\frac{\delta \phi^2}{\dot\phi^2}\,.
\label{dphi12}
\end{equation}
Finding and solving the evolution equation for $\delta s$ not only gives an intuitive picture of the entropy perturbations but is also a more robust manner of numerically computing entropy perturbations than subtracting from the total pressure perturbation its adiabatic component, as in \eqref{eq:Pnad} \cite{Gordon:2000hv, Price:2014xpa}. For these reasons it has become the preferred way of describing entropy perturbations during multifield inflation. However, as already mentioned in Sec. \ref{Intro}, $\delta s$ becomes ill-defined in cases where the effective mass of isocurvature perturbations would become tachyonic since it would signal a destabilisation effect which is unphysical given that the background evolution remains stable \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr,Cicoli:2019ulk}. As we will see in Sec. \ref{sec:SpuriousInstability}, in this case the proper entropy variable to be used is $\hat{S}_{ij}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{entropyMap.pdf}
\caption{Summary of various entropy perturbation variables found in the literature and relations between them. The relations contained within the dashed rectangle hold only for `minimal scalars', i.e. scalar fields with sum-separable potentials and canonical kinetic terms.}
\label{fig:entropy}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Minimal scalars}

For minimally coupled scalars with canonical kinetic terms and sum-separable potentials, which we will call `minimal scalars', one can show that the relative entropy perturbation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm rel}=\frac{1}{3 \dot\phi_0^2} \frac{V_N \dot\phi^1 \dot\phi^2}{3 H \dot\phi_0+2 V_T }\,S_{12}\,,
\label{eq:Srel}
\end{equation}
where $V_T=T^i V_i$ and $V_N=N^i V_i$ are respectively the projections of the scalar potential along the directions tangent and orthogonal to the background trajectory defined in (\ref{eq:TN}). Using the notation of \cite{Hwang:2000jh}, the relative entropy variable $S_{12}$ can, in turn, be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
S_{12}=a^3 \frac{d}{d t }\left(\frac{\delta \phi^{12}}{a^3}\right)\,,
\label{eq:S12}
\end{equation}
where $\delta \phi^{12}$ is the generalised entropy introduced in (\ref{dphi12}). In the simple case of a potential of the form $V = \frac12 m_1^2(\phi^1)^2 + \frac12 m_2^2(\phi^2)^2$, in the slow-roll approximation (\ref{eq:S12}) reduces to $S_{12}\simeq -3H \delta\phi^{12}$, which using (\ref{eq:deltas}) with $G_1=G_2=1$ gives:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{S} \simeq -\frac{\dot{\phi}^1\dot{\phi}^2}{3\dot\phi_0^2}\,S_{12}\,,
\end{equation}
showing that in this particular case $\tilde{S}$ becomes proportional to $S_{12}$. Let us stress that in the general case $\tilde S$ is proportional only to the total entropy perturbation, as in (\ref{Sds}), and not to the relative entropy perturbation. 

The relations between the different definitions of entropy perturbations discussed above are summarised pictorially in Fig. \ref{fig:entropy}. We stress in particular which of them can be used only in case of flat field space without kinetic coupling.



\subsection{Entropy perturbations after inflation}
\label{sec:PerturbationsAfterInflation}

After inflation and the subsequent reheating phase, the Universe is expected to enter a radiation dominated epoch where photons, baryons, cold dark matter and neutrinos make up the primordial plasma. Neglecting velocity isocurvature perturbations, the presence of entropy perturbations at this stage leads to a difference in the number density perturbations, $\delta n_i/n_i$, between the various species. Taking photons $\gamma$ as a reference, we can thus have different non-vanishing relative entropies $S_{n\gamma}$, where $n$ can be cold dark matter, baryons or neutrinos. These are the quantities that are constrained by CMB data.

In fact, the study of cosmological perturbations generated during inflation boils down to the study of CMB anisotropies that can be characterised by their power spectra:
\begin{equation}
(2\pi)^3 \delta(\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q}) P_{IJ}(k) = \langle I(\mathbf{k}) J(\mathbf{q})\rangle \,,
\end{equation}
where $I$ and $J$ can denote the curvature $\zeta = \sum_i \zeta_i$ or any post-inflationary isocurvature perturbation $S_{n\gamma}$. Observational constraints can then be formulated in terms of the `primordial isocurvature fraction':\footnote{We are not interested in this paper on the other parameter that is constrained by Planck observations, namely the `correlation fraction':
\begin{equation}
\cos\Delta_{IJ} = \frac{P_{IJ}}{(P_{II} P_{JJ})^{1/2}} \in (-1, 1) \,,
\end{equation}
which is taken to be scale-independent in Planck analyses \cite{Akrami:2018odb}.}
\begin{equation}
\beta_{\rm iso}(k) = \frac{P_{S_{n\gamma}}(k)}{P_\zeta (k) + P_{S_{n\gamma}}(k)} \,, 
\end{equation}
where $P_{S_{n\gamma}}(k)\equiv P_{S_{n\gamma}S_{n\gamma}} (k)$ and $P_\zeta(k)\equiv P_{\zeta \zeta}(k)$. In general this quantity is not scale invariant, so that Planck constraints are placed at three different reference scales, with the observational upper bound on $\beta_{\rm iso}$ going from about $1\%$ to $10\%$ depending on the species involves \cite{Akrami:2018odb}. Given our illustrative purposes though, we adopt the assumption of~\cite{Montandon:2020kuk} and take the spectral index for all the spectra to be zero, so that the primordial isocurvature fraction turns out to be scale-independent. Let us also stress that the constraint on $\beta_{\rm iso}$ comes indirectly: once we have the primordial power spectra $P_{IJ}$ at the start of the radiation dominated era (that implies that we have consistently transferred all perturbations from the inflationary to the post-inflationary era) we need to evolve them through the Einstein equations till the release of the CMB, and then translate them into observable quantities using the Boltzmann equations. Only then we are able to place constraints on $\beta_{\rm iso}$ by means of CMB constraints.

After this discussion of observational constraints, it is clear that we should use the relative entropy variable $S_{ij}$ defined in \eqref{eq:Sab} to transfer the entropy mode from the inflationary scalar field system to the primordial plasma that gets formed after reheating and consists of fluids only. In fact, $S_{ij}$ has already been used in several previous works~\cite{Polarski:1994rz, Langlois:1999dw, Bartolo:2001rt}. In general, in order to make contact between the inflationary and the reheating phase, one needs to have a complete model where the couplings of the inflationary scalars to the various species are known, so that $S_{ij}$ can be evolved up to radiation domination.

Notice instead that we would obtain a result which could be wrong by several orders of magnitude if we used the total entropy $S$ given by (\ref{TotS}) \cite{Huston:2011fr, Huston:2013kgl} since $S$ contains both intrinsic and relative contributions. Similar considerations would apply to the entropy perturbation $\tilde S$ orthogonal to the background trajectory given in (\ref{eq:RSTN}) since (\ref{Sds}) shows that $S$ is proportional to $\tilde S$. Moreover, as we will discuss in more detail in Sec. \ref{sec:SpuriousInstability}, in some specific models \cite{Wands:2000dp,Cicoli:2018ccr, Cicoli:2019ulk} the use of \eqref{eq:RSTN} can lead to an unphysical instability of the entropy perturbations due to the spurious divergence of the normal projector $N^i$. In these cases, however, also the relative entropy $S_{ij}$ itself becomes an inappropriate variable since the curvature $\zeta$ turns out to be ill-defined. One has therefore to use the `improved' relative entropy variable $\hat{S}_{ij}$ given in (\ref{hatSij}) which remains finite during inflation and can be safely matched to the post-inflationary epoch, leading to $\hat{S}_{n\gamma}$ for different species denoted by $n$. In order to compare with observational constraints on $\beta_{\rm iso}$, one has then to infer $S_{n\gamma}$ from $\hat{S}_{n\gamma}$ using again (\ref{hatSij}). Notice that there is no apparent divergence in the radiation dominated era since $S_{n\gamma}$ is a well-defined quantity. 



\section{Spurious instability from light kinetically coupled fields}
\label{sec:SpuriousInstability}

In this section we shall discuss in depth cases where $S_{ij}$ and $\tilde S$ become ill-defined. In the case of kinetically coupled light scalars, the authors of \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk,Cicoli:2018ccr} found that the isocurvature perturbation $\tilde S$ grows rapidly on super-horizon scales despite the fact that the background trajectory is essentially single field and stable. We will now show that this apparent paradox is caused by the use of wrong entropy variables. 

\subsection{Evolution of isocurvature perturbations}

Before analysing a particular toy-model, let us briefly review how to describe the evolution of isocurvature perturbations in generic multifield models with a curved field space. We will first consider the `field space basis' where scalar perturbations are parametrised as $\delta \phi^i$, and then the `kinematic basis' where the perturbations are decomposed in modes tangent and orthogonal to the background trajectory. 

\subsubsection*{Field space basis}

The gauge invariant scalar perturbations defined as $Q^i=\delta\phi^i + \Psi \dot{\phi}^i/H$ follow \cite{Sasaki:1995aw}:
\begin{equation}
D_t^2 Q^i+3H D_t Q^i-a^{-2}\,\nabla^2 Q^i+{C^i}_j Q^j=0 \,,
\label{eq:SasakiStewart}
\end{equation}
where $C^i_j$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
C^i_j=\nabla_j V^i-\dot{\phi}^2 R^i_{k\ell j} T^k T^\ell +2 \epsilon\,\dot\phi_0^{-1}\,H\left(T^i V_j+T_j V^i\right)+2\epsilon(3-\epsilon)H^2 T^i T_j\,.
\end{equation}
In order to analyse the stability of these perturbations it is useful to expand the covariant derivatives, thereby recasting the Mukhanov-Sasaki (MS) equation into the following form:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{Q}^i+\dot{Q}^j \left(2\Gamma^i_{jk}\dot{\phi}^k+3 H \delta^i_j\right)-a^{-2}\,\nabla^2 Q^i+{ (\mathbb{M}^2)^i}_j Q^j=0\,,
\label{eq:MSQa}
\end{equation}
where the mass-squared matrix looks like:
\begin{equation}
{(\mathbb{M}^2)^i}_j\equiv C^i_j+\left(\Gamma^i_{jk,\ell}+\Gamma^i_{\ell m}\Gamma^m_{jk}\right)\dot{\phi}^k\dot{\phi}^\ell+\Gamma^i_{jk}\left(\ddot{\phi}^k+3 H\dot{\phi}^k\right).
\end{equation}
Making use of the background equations of motion and recalling that:
\begin{equation}
{R^i}_{jk\ell}\equiv \Gamma^i_{j\ell,k}-\Gamma^i_{jk,\ell}+\Gamma^i_{km}\Gamma^m_{\ell j}-\Gamma^i_{\ell m}\Gamma^m_{kj}\,,
\end{equation}
the mass-squared matrix can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
{(\mathbb{M}^2)^i}_j=\partial_j V^i+\Gamma^i_{k\ell,j}\dot{\phi}^k\dot{\phi}^\ell+2\epsilon\,\dot\phi_0^{-1}\,H\left(T^i V_j+T_j V^i\right)+2\epsilon(3-\epsilon) H^2 T^i T_j\,.
\label{Msqfb}
\end{equation}
Should there be an instability, at least one of the eigenvalues of $\mathbb{M}^2$ would be large and negative in order to overcome the friction term in (\ref{eq:MSQa}) and to drive the growth of the perturbations on super-horizon scales.
 

\subsubsection*{Kinematic basis}

As already mentioned in Sec. \ref{sec:PerturbationsDuringInflation} regarding the entropy field $s$, in multifield setups it is often useful to work in the kinematic basis rather than in the field space one. One projects the field space perturbations $Q^i$ onto the kinematic basis by using the vielbeins $e^I_i$:
\begin{equation}
Q^I={e^I}_i \,Q^i\,,
\label{eq:QI}
\end{equation}
allowing to write \eqref{eq:MSQa} in this new basis as \cite{Achucarro:2010da}:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{D}_t^2 Q^I +3H \mathbb{D}_t Q^I-a^{-2}\,\nabla^2 Q^I+{C^I}_J Q^J=0\,,
\label{eq:pertkin}
\end{equation}
where ${C^I}_J =e^I_i e^j_J C^i_j$ and the new covariant derivative is defined as $\mathbb{D}_t Q^I\equiv \dot{Q}{^I}+Y^I_J Q^J$ with $Y^I_J\equiv{e^I}_i D_t{e^i}_J $. In order to analyse the stability of this set of coupled oscillators it is useful, as before, to expand the covariant derivatives and to write the MS equation as:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{Q}^I+(3 H \delta^I_J+2 {Y^I}_J)\dot{Q}^J-a^{-2}\,\nabla^2Q^I+(\mu^2)^I_J Q^J=0\,,
\label{MSeq}
\end{equation}
where we defined the mass-squared matrix of the perturbations in the kinematic basis as:
\begin{equation}
{\left(\mu^2\right )^I}_J\equiv {C^I}_J+{{\dot{Y}}^I }_{\:\: J}+3H {Y^I}_J+{Y^I}_K{Y^K}_J\,.
\end{equation}
In a simple 2-field case one may choose: 
\begin{equation}
e^i_1=e_T^i=T^i \qquad\text{and}\qquad e^i_2=e_N^i=N^i\,,
\end{equation}
where $T^i$ and $N^i$ are the tangent and normal vectors to the background trajectory introduced in (\ref{eq:TN}). The background dynamics implies:
\begin{equation}
D_t T^i=-H \eta_\perp N^i \qquad\text{and}\qquad D_t N^i=H \eta_\perp T^i\,,
\end{equation}
where $\eta_\perp = V_i N^i/(H\dot\phi_0)$ is the turning rate of the trajectory. These relations yield: 
\begin{equation}
{Y^T}_T={Y^N}_N=0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad {Y^T}_N=-{Y^N}_T= H \eta_\perp\,.
\end{equation}
One can then show that: 
\begin{eqnarray}
{\left(\mu^2\right )^T}_T&=&V_{TT}+4\epsilon \dot\phi_0^{-1} H V_T+2 \epsilon(3-\epsilon) H^2-(H \eta_\perp)^2\,, \label{first} \\
{\left(\mu^2\right )^N}_N&=&V_{NN}+\dot\phi_0^2\, R-(H \eta_\perp)^2\,, \label{muNN} \\
{\left(\mu^2\right )^T}_N&=&V_{NT}+ 2\epsilon \dot\phi_0^{-1} H V_N+H^2\eta_\perp (3-\epsilon -\xi_\perp)\,,
\label{Asympt}
\end{eqnarray}
where $R$ is the Ricci scalar of the field space and $\xi_\perp \equiv -\dot\eta_\perp/(H \eta_\perp)$.

\subsection{A 2-field model with an apparent instability}
\label{2fieldModel}

In order to illustrate our claims in the simplest possible terms, in what follows we shall focus on a 2-field system, $(\phi^1,\phi^2)$, where the metric and the scalar potential look like:
\begin{equation}
G_{ij}= \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
   1 & 0  \\
0 & f^2(\phi^1) \\
  \end{array} \right)\qquad \text{and} \qquad V = V(\phi^1,\phi^2) \,.
	\label{simplemodel}
\end{equation}
It can be shown that the field space described by (\ref{eq:L}) with (\ref{simplemodel}) exhibits a non-vanishing scalar curvature that takes the form:
\begin{equation}
R=-2 \,\frac{f_{11}}{f}\,,
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}
where $f_i\equiv \partial_{\phi^i} f$. The equations of motion become:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\Box\phi^i +g^{\mu\nu}\Gamma_{jk}^i\partial_\mu{\phi}^j\partial_\nu\phi^k+G^{ij} V_j=0\ ,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\Box \phi^i=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\mu\left(\sqrt{|g|}g^{\mu\nu }\partial_\nu\phi^i\right)$ and $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ are Christoffel symbols which describe the metric connection of the field space. 

These models may give rise to non-geodesic motion in field space with a curved trajectory. Considering homogeneous fields $\phi^i=\phi^i(t)$ in an expanding Universe with $\sqrt{|g|}=a^3$, the equations of motion can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\dot\pi_1 = a^3 \left(f f_1(\dot\phi^2)^2 -V_1\right), \qquad 
\dot\pi_2 =-a^3 V_2\,,
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $\pi_i$ are the conjugate momenta ($\pi_i=\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \dot{\phi}^i$) given by:
\begin{equation}
\pi_1 = a^3 \dot\phi^1\,, \qquad\qquad \pi_2 = a^3 f^2 \dot\phi^2\,.
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
The background dynamics of the system is determined by (\ref{eq1}), (\ref{eq2}) and the Friedmann equation:
\begin{equation}
3 H^2= \frac12 G_{ij}\dot{\phi}^i\dot{\phi}^j+V \,.
\end{equation}
In order to understand the effects of the kinetic coupling on the inflationary dynamics we need to analyse both the background trajectory and cosmological perturbations. To provide some quantitative results, let us assume for concreteness that the potential for the inflaton $\phi^1$ is of the Starobinsky form \cite{Starobinsky:1980te} and the spectator field $\phi^2$ is equipped with a quadratic potential:
\begin{equation} 
V(\phi^1,\phi^2)=\Lambda^4 \left(1-e^{\sqrt{\frac23}\,\phi^1}\right)^2 +\frac{m_2^2}{2}\,(\phi^2)^2\,,
\label{eq:example}
\end{equation}
where we will assume $m_2\ll m_1 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\,\frac{\Lambda^2}{M_p} < H$ (reinstating appropriate factors of the reduced Planck mass) with $\Lambda\simeq 1.8\times 10^{-10}\,M_p$ in order to match observational bounds on adiabatic perturbations. Moreover we shall consider an exponential kinetic coupling (which is very natural in supergravity and string models) of the form:
\begin{equation} 
f(\phi^1)=e^{-\lambda \phi^1}\,,
\label{eq:kc_example}
\end{equation}
so that the field space has a constant scalar curvature $R=-2\lambda^2$. The super-horizon behaviour of the isocurvature modes depends on the geometry of the field space. In particular, considering the case of a massless spectator field, i.e. $m_2=0$, the mass associated to the isocurvature perturbations $\delta s$ given by (\ref{muNN}) becomes \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk}: 
\begin{equation} 
{\left(\mu^2\right )^N}_N=-\lambda V_1 -2 \lambda^2 \epsilon H^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where the first term comes from the field space metric connection (and it is of order $\sqrt{\epsilon}$), while the second from the field space curvature (and it is of order $\epsilon$). Notice that in this case $\eta_\perp=0$. Therefore, if the field space shows an $\sim{O}(1)$ scalar curvature (as typical of supergravity and string models), the sign of $(\mu^2)_N^N$ during inflation is determined by the relative sign between $\lambda$ and the first derivative of the inflationary potential. Given that in Starobinsky inflation $V_1>0$, ${\left(\mu^2\right)^N}_N<0$ for $\lambda>0$.\footnote{Notice that the form of the inflationary potential is crucial to induce a tachyonic entropy perturbation $\delta s$ since a quintessence-like potential of the form $V = V_0\,e^{-k\phi^1}$ would not induce any negative eigenvalue of the mass-squared matrix \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk, Cicoli:2020cfj, Cicoli:2020noz}.} It is important to stress that a negative $(\mu^2)_N^N$ is not sufficient to trigger the growth of the isocurvature perturbations by itself, since (\ref{eq:MSQa}) and (\ref{MSeq}) also feature a Hubble friction term. We show some examples related to different values of $\lambda$ in Fig. \ref{fig:isogrowth}. These results suggest that, despite the fact that for every value of $\lambda$ the system trajectory becomes effectively single field (as signalled by the fact that $\eta_\perp=0$), there might be a growth of isocurvature perturbations triggered by slow-roll suppressed contributions. This somewhat paradoxical state of affairs requires further investigation. Given our interest in understanding the origin of the apparent isocurvature growth, from now on we will focus on the case with $\lambda=2/\sqrt{3}$.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{k0_new.pdf}\includegraphics[width=0.325\textwidth]{k45_new.pdf}\includegraphics[width=0.335\textwidth]{k2sqrt3_new.pdf}
\caption{Adiabatic and isocurvature power spectra (in terms of $\tilde{S}$) for the system described by (\ref{eq:example}) and (\ref{eq:kc_example}) with $m_2=0$. Left: for $\lambda=0$ the isocurvature perturbations decay on super-horizon scales. Centre: for $\lambda=4/5$ the mass of the isocurvature perturbations is tachyonic but the isocurvature power spectrum still decays because of Hubble friction. Right: for $\lambda=2/\sqrt{3}$ we have tachyonic isocurvature modes that produce an exponential growth of $\tilde{S}$.}
\label{fig:isogrowth}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Sec. \ref{InstabilityOrigin} we reveal the nature of this spurious instability first by uncovering the origin of the growth of the isocurvature perturbations in the kinematic basis and then by showing that the relative entropy perturbation between the two scalars is well-behaved and vanishingly small during inflation.



\subsection{Origin of the spurious instability}
\label{InstabilityOrigin}

In this section we will analyse the eigenvalues of the mass-squared matrices of the perturbations in the field space and in the kinematic basis, showing that the apparent instability of the isocurvature perturbation $\tilde{S}$ is a feature exclusively of the kinematic basis triggered by $(\mu^2)_N^N<0$. In fact, this instability disappears in the field space basis where the mass-squared matrix has no negative eigenvalue, showing that $\tilde{S}$ is not a physical quantity. We will see that a well-behaved, i.e. both gauge invariant and finite, quantity is the relative entropy perturbation $S_{\rm rel} = \hat{S}_{12}$ defined in (\ref{hatSij}).

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Field space basis}

Restricting our attention to the model described by (\ref{eq:example}) and (\ref{eq:kc_example}) and assuming for simplicity $m_2=0$, one can show that, on-shell, the only non-vanishing entry of the mass-squared matrix (\ref{Msqfb}) is:
\begin{equation}
{\left(\mathbb{M}^2\right)^1}_1= V_{11}+4\epsilon \dot\phi_0^{-1} H V_1+2\epsilon(3-\epsilon) H^2\,.
\label{eq:mQ22Field}
\end{equation}
As shown in App. \ref{sec:singlefield}, (\ref{eq:mQ22Field}) can be written in terms of the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\epsilon=-\dot{H}/H^2$, $\eta = \dot\epsilon/(\epsilon H)$ and $\kappa = \dot\eta/(\eta H)$ as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\left(\mathbb{M}^2\right)^1}_1}{H^2}=-\frac{3 \eta}{2}+\frac{\epsilon \eta}{2}-\frac{\eta^2}{4}-\frac{\kappa \eta}{2}\,,
\end{equation}
which matches exactly the mass of the $Q$-perturbation obtained in the single field formalism, so excluding the presence of any tachyonic instability in this basis. 

\item \textbf{Kinematic basis}

In the model under study, the relations (\ref{first})-(\ref{Asympt}) reduce asymptotically (i.e. when the system relaxes to the background attractor solution) to:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\left(\mu^2\right )^T}_T&=& V_{11}+ 4\epsilon \dot\phi_0^{-1} H\,V_1+2 \epsilon(3-\epsilon) H^2\,, \\
\label{eq:TachyonicMass}
{\left(\mu^2\right )^N}_N&=& \frac{f_1}{f}\,V_1 +\epsilon H^2 R = -\lambda V_1 -2 \lambda^2 \epsilon H^2\,, \\
{\left(\mu^2\right )^T}_N&=&0\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Notice that ${\left(\mu^2\right )^T}_T=(\mathbb{M}^2)^1_1$, an indication that adiabatic perturbations behave the same way in both bases and in a manner compatible with a single field analysis of the model. However, as shown in Sec. \ref{2fieldModel}, we can have a tachyonic orthogonal direction if the metric connection or the field space curvature $R$ give rise to sufficiently negative contributions, signaling the presence of a potential instability. 
\end{itemize}

Given that the difference between the kinematic and the field space basis is the mere multiplication by the vielbein, as in (\ref{eq:QI}), it is natural to conclude that the origin of the apparent geometrical instability is the time evolution of the vielbein, a fact we will now investigate in detail.

\subsubsection*{A growing projector}

In order to pin down the origin of the apparent geometrical instability in the kinematic basis, we consider the time evolution of the vector orthogonal to the background trajectory: 
\begin{equation}
D_t N^i=H \eta_\perp T^i\,.
\end{equation}
In the cases under consideration the background trajectory is straight, implying that $\eta_\perp=0$, leading to:
\begin{equation}
\dot N^i =-\Gamma^i_{jk}\dot{\phi}^j N^k\,.
\end{equation}
Furthermore in the attractor solution $\dot\phi^2=0$, implying:
\begin{equation}
N^1=0\qquad\text{and}\qquad\dot{N}^2= - \Gamma^2_{21} \dot\phi^1 N^2\,.
\end{equation}
The equation for $N^2$ can be integrated to find $N^2=1/f $ or equivalently $N_2=f=e^{-\lambda \phi^1}$, showing that $N_2$ grows during inflation as the inflaton $\phi^1$ rolls down towards the origin of the potential from positive values. Notice that the normalisation of the orthogonal vector, $N^i N_i=1$,  is preserved at all times.\footnote{This time evolution could also have been deduced from the normalisation of the orthogonal vector $N^i$.} Expanding the definition (\ref{deltas}) of the orthogonal perturbation $\delta s$ one finds that it involves only the $N_2$ component:
\begin{equation}
\delta s = N_1 \delta\phi^1+N_2 \delta\phi^2= N_2 \delta\phi^2\,.
\end{equation}
As shown above, the perturbation $\delta\phi^2=Q^2$ (in the spatially flat gauge) has a vanishing mass, and so it becomes constant on super-horizon scales. On the other hand, as we have just seen, $N^2$ grows during inflation, signalling a potentially dangerous growth of $\delta s$. This is the very origin of the apparent geometric instability observed in \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr,Cicoli:2019ulk}.

However, as mentioned in Sec. \ref{sec:PerturbationsAfterInflation}, observational bounds on isocurvature perturbations are given in terms of the post-inflationary relative entropy perturbation $S_{n\gamma}$ which, after a proper understanding of the reheating epoch, should arise from the inflationary non-adiabatic perturbation $S_{12}$ defined in (\ref{eq:Sab}). Thus the observed growth in $\delta s$ does not rule these models out since the quantity to be considered to match observations is $S_{12}$. However, in this particular case also $S_{12}$ is ill-defined as the action of the spectator field $\phi^2$ is (in the massless limit): 
\begin{equation}
\frac{{L}}{\sqrt{|g|}}\supset\frac12\,f^2(\phi^1)\, (\partial \phi^2)^2\,,
\end{equation}
which gives $\rho_2=\frac12 \,f^2(\phi^1) (\dot\phi^2)^2$ that rapidly goes to zero during inflation. We therefore conclude that $S_{12}$ is singular. Notice that the same problem would arise for canonically normalised massless scalars (which however do not suffer from a growing $\delta s$). 


\subsection{Vanishing relative entropy perturbation}

We now further clarify the spurious nature of the apparent geometric instability which characterises this class of models by showing that the relative entropy $S_{\rm rel}=\hat{S}_{12}$ given by (\ref{eq:Sreldef}) remains finite and vanishingly small during inflation. We argue that $S_{\rm rel}$ provides a consistent definition of isocurvature perturbations that are independent of the (unstable) vielbeins, in order to compute the scalar 2-point functions and to confront the model predictions with observational constraints. 

Let us start the computation of $S_{\rm rel}$ by noticing that the energy-momentum tensor during inflation can be decomposed as:
\begin{equation}
T^{\mu\nu}=T^{\mu\nu}_{(1)}+T^{\mu\nu}_{(2)}\,,
\end{equation}
where the subscripts $(1)$ and $(2)$ refer to $\phi^1$ and $\phi^2$ respectively. Due to the kinetic coupling, the individual $T^{\mu\nu}_{(i)}$ are not conserved since there is energy transfer between the fluids \cite{Malik:2004tf}:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\nu T^{\mu\nu}_{(1)}= {T}^\mu \qquad\text{and}\qquad \nabla_\nu T^{\mu\nu}_{(2)}=-{T}^\mu\,,
\end{equation}
where ${T}^\mu$ is the energy transfer function. Despite the fact that there is some freedom in the definition of the two fluids, it is natural to write the energy and pressure of the two fields as (see also App.~\ref{app:gaugeinvariance}):
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:energies}
\rho_1&=&\frac12 (\dot\phi^1)^2+V^{(1)}(\phi^1)\,,\qquad \qquad \rho_2=\frac12 f(\phi^1)^2 (\dot\phi^2)^2+ V^{(2)}(\phi^2)\,,  \\
P_1&=&\frac12 (\dot\phi^1)^2-V^{(1)}(\phi^1)\,,\qquad \qquad P_2=\frac12 f(\phi^1)^2 (\dot\phi^2)^2-V^{(2)}(\phi^2)\,,
\label{eq:pressure}
\end{eqnarray}
where we decomposed the sum-separable potential in (\ref{eq:example}) as $V(\phi^1,\phi^2)=V^{(1)}(\phi^1)+V^{(2)}(\phi^2)$. The energy transfer function takes the form:
\begin{equation}
{T}^\mu=\begin{pmatrix}
 \dot{\rho}_1+3H(\rho_1+P_1)\\
 \vec{0}\\
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
f f_1\, \dot\phi^1\, (\dot\phi^2)^2\\
 \vec{0}\\
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
The sound speeds of the two fluids defined in (\ref{eq:energies}) and (\ref{eq:pressure}) are:
\begin{equation}
c_1^2=1+\frac{2 V_1}{3H\dot\phi^1-f f_1\, (\dot\phi^2)^2}\,,\qquad c_2^2=1+\frac{2 V_2 }{\dot\phi^2 (3Hf^2+ f f_1 \dot\phi^1)}\,,
\end{equation}
while the overall sound speed is given by:
\begin{equation}
c_s^2=1+\frac{2}{3H}\frac{V_i \dot{\phi}^i}{\dot{\phi}_j\dot{\phi}^j}\,.
\end{equation}
In order to compute the relative entropy perturbation $S_{\rm rel}$, we need to use perturbation theory at linear order. Given that $S_{\rm rel}$ is gauge invariant, we can compute it in any gauge. For simplicity we shall use the spatially flat gauge where the perturbed Einstein equations take the form presented in App.~\ref{AppA}. Energy and pressure perturbations read:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta\rho_1 &=&-\Phi (\dot\phi^1)^2 + \dot\phi^1 \delta\dot\phi^1  +V_1 \delta\phi^1\,, \\
\delta P_1&=&-\Phi (\dot\phi^1)^2 +\dot\phi^1 \delta\dot\phi^1 - V_1 \delta\phi^1\,, \\
\delta\rho_2&=& \delta P_2 = -\Phi f^2 (\dot\phi^2)^2 +f^2 \dot\phi^2 \delta\dot\phi^2 + (\dot\phi^2)^2 f f_1 \delta \phi^1 + V_2\delta\phi^2 \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where Einstein equations imply that the lapse function (defined in App. \ref{AppA}) is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Phi =\frac{1}{2H} \left(\dot\phi^1 \delta \phi^1 + f^2 \dot\phi^2 \delta\phi^2\right)\,.
\end{equation}
In order to get some analytic results, let us focus again on the massless case with $m_2=0$ (we will however show below also numerical results for the $m_2\neq 0$ case). In the 2-field case, it is easy to see that the relative entropy perturbation (\ref{eq:Sreldef}) can also be written as:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm rel}=\frac{H}{\dot P} \left[\left( c_1^2-c_s^2\right)\delta\rho_1+\left( c_2^2-c_s^2\right)\delta\rho_2\right]\,.
\label{Srelnew}
\end{equation}
Before computing this expression, it is important to realise that the equation of motion for $\phi^2$ can be integrated exactly leading to:
\begin{equation}
\left(f \grave{\phi}^2\right)(N)=\left(f \grave{\phi}^2\right)(0)\;e^{-\int_0^N(3-\epsilon)dN^{'}+\lambda \Delta \phi^1}\,,
\label{eq:standardfphi2}
\end{equation}
where we used the number of e-foldings $N=\int H dt$ as time variable, $\grave{\phi}^2\equiv d \phi^2/dN$ and $\Delta \phi^1=\phi^1(N)-\phi^1(0)$. Given that in Starobinsky inflation $\Delta\phi^1\simeq\sqrt{\frac32}\ln\left(1-\frac{4N}{3}e^{-\sqrt{\frac23}\phi^1(0)}\right)$, it is easy to see that during inflation the velocity of the canonical spectator field becomes rapidly negligible since:
\begin{equation}
(f\grave{\phi}^2)\simeq (f\grave{\phi}^2)(0)\,e^{-3N} \to 0\,. 
\end{equation}
Using this crucial result, we can now evaluate the different contributions to $S_{\rm rel}$, The terms involving the speeds of sound look like:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_1^2-c_s^2&=& (1-c_s^2) (f \grave{\phi}^2)^2\left(\frac{1+\frac{f_1 \grave{\phi}^1}{3f} }{\frac{f_1 \grave{\phi}^1}{3f} (f \grave{\phi}^2)^2-(\grave{\phi}^1)^2}\right)
\sim{O}( (f \grave{\phi}^2)^2)\to 0\,,\\
c_2^2-c_s^2&=&(1-c_s^2)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
while the energy density perturbations can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta\rho_1 &=& H^2 \left[\left(\frac{V_1}{H^2}-\frac{(\grave{\phi}^1)^3}{2}\right)\delta\phi^1+\grave{\phi}^1\delta\grave{\phi}^1\right]- \underbrace{\frac12 H^2 f (f \grave{\phi}^2)\,(\grave{\phi}^1)^2\delta\phi^2}_{{O}( f \grave{\phi}^2)\to 0} \\ 
\delta\rho_2 &=& H^2 (f\grave{\phi}^2) \left[\frac12 (f \grave{\phi}^2) \left(\frac{2 f_1}{f}-\grave{\phi}^1\right)\delta\phi^1+f\delta\grave{\phi}^2-\frac12 f (f\grave{\phi}^2)^2\delta\phi^2\right] \sim{O}( f \grave{\phi}^2)\to 0\,. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Finally the ratio $H/\dot P$ is finite and well-behaved since:
\begin{equation}
\frac{H}{\dot P} = -\frac{1}{6\epsilon H^2 + 2 V_T \sqrt{2\epsilon} }\,.
\end{equation}
Thus these relations, when inserted in (\ref{Srelnew}), imply that after a few e-foldings of inflation the relative entropy perturbation becomes immediately negligible since $S_{\rm rel}\sim {O}(f\grave{\phi}^2)\rightarrow 0$.

\label{fig:Scomponents}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We confirmed this analytic result by performing a numerical analysis of the evolution of all entropy variables $S$, $S_{\rm int}$, $S_{\rm rel}$, $S_{12}$ and $\tilde{S}$ for 3 different values of the parameter $\alpha=m_2/m_1=\{10^{-5},10^{-3},0\}$ which fixes the mass hierarchy between $\phi^2$ and $\phi^1$. The outcome is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Scomponents} for modes exiting the horizon $N=60$ e-foldings before the end of inflation. Notice that the isocurvature power spectrum computed using $\tilde{S}$ grows not just for $\alpha=0$ but also for $\alpha=10^{-5}$, while it decays for $\alpha=10^{-3}$ even it features a slight climb back up between $50$ and $60$ e-foldings. This implies that the perturbation $\delta s$ orthogonal to the background trajectory is a bad variable not just in the $m_2=0$ case but also more in general for spectator fields lighter than the inflaton. This is true, above all, also for the relative entropy perturbation $S_{12}$ which clearly diverges for all values of $\alpha$ since the energy density $\rho_2$ becomes in practice constant during inflation. On the other hand, the `improved' relative entropy perturbation $\hat{S}_{12}=S_{\rm rel}$ gives rise to a decaying non-adiabatic power spectrum. 

We therefore conclude that the apparent geometrical instability of models with light kinetically coupled spectator fields is unphysical and this class of models, upon exit from inflation, gives rise to a radiation phase where perturbations of the gravitational potential are set by the inflationary curvature perturbations and where there are no isocurvature perturbations, just like in single field inflationary models.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

Effective field theories characterised by multiple scalar fields and a Riemannian field manifold are a ubiquitous feature of gravitational theories with non-minimal couplings, supergravity models and string theory compactifications. One of their primary applications is early Universe cosmology where the dynamics of the scalar field system drives cosmic inflation. In a multifield framework the study of cosmological perturbations deserves however careful attention. In particular, non-adiabatic fluctuations can potentially rule these models out by giving rise to isocurvature perturbations whose amplitude exceeds observational constraints. Various entropy variables have been proposed so far in the literature, with different pros and cons.

In this paper we clarified which of these entropy perturbation variables should be used to match observations, in particular for the subtle case of non-linear sigma models. We first reviewed all the ways to describe non-adiabatic modes: ($i$) the total entropy perturbation $S$ which can be decomposed in an intrinsic contribution $S_{\rm int}$ and a relative one $S_{\rm rel}$; ($ii$) the relative entropy perturbation between two fluids $S_{ij}$ defined as the difference between the corresponding curvature perturbations, $S_{ij} = \zeta_i-\zeta_j$; ($iii$) the fluctuation $\delta s$ of the entropy field corresponding to fluctuations orthogonal to the background inflationary trajectory in field space. This last variable, despite being very useful to perform an efficient numerical integration of the field equations during inflation, is not the right one to match data which are instead expressed in terms of $S_{ij}$. Similar considerations apply to the total entropy perturbation $S$ since it is proportional to $\delta s$. 

We therefore argued that the right variable to be studied is $S_{ij}$ which should be evolved from the inflationary epoch to the post-inflationary era until CMB decoupling where observations are performed. This process clearly requires a detailed understanding of the reheating epoch and how the fluctuations of the microscopic degrees of freedom get transferred to density and pressure perturbations of the different fluids (photons, baryons, cold dark matter and neutrinos) which characterise the post-inflationary history of our Universe. 

We noticed that the use of $S$ or $\delta s$ instead of $S_{ij}$ in general can yield results which are wrong even by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, in the case of kinetically coupled light spectator fields which can arise naturally in string inflation, the mass of $\delta s$ fluctuations can become tachyonic, signalling the emergence of a potentially dangerous destabilisation effect due to the growth of these isocurvature modes. In this situation, the relative entropy perturbation $S_{ij}$ becomes also pathological since it blows up due to the fact that during inflation the energy density of the spectator fields very quickly goes to zero. 

In a simple 2-field model with a Starobinsky-like inflationary potential and a light spectator field, we showed that the growth of these non-adiabatic modes is unphysical and the associated destabilisation effect is spurious since it is caused just by the use of entropy variables which in this case become ill-defined. In fact, $\delta s$ increases after horizon-exit just because the vector normal to the background trajectory diverges, while no anomalous growth of isocurvature fluctuations is seen when considering scalar fluctuations in the original field basis. We therefore defined a so-called improved entropy perturbation $\hat{S}_{ij}$ associated to the relative entropy perturbation $S_{\rm rel}$ which remains always well-behaved and decays during inflation, showing that the dynamics of this class of models becomes effectively single field, with no production of isocurvature fluctuations. In order to perform a detailed matching with observations, one should therefore study the evolution of $\hat{S}_{ij}$ during inflation and the subsequent reheating epoch, translating at the end its value into the standard relative entropy perturbation $S_{n\gamma}$ between photons and a generic $n$ species since this quantity is now finite and it is the one used to express the isocurvature fraction $\beta_{\rm iso}$ constrained by data.

Let us finally stress that all entropy variables described in this paper are gauge invariant, even in the generic case of a curved field space. Hence in principle they are all good candidates to describe physical quantities. However well-defined physical quantities should be not just gauge invariant but also finite. The failure to satisfy this last requirement is the reason why $\delta s$ and $S_{ij}$ are not the proper entropy variables to be used to confront observations, as emerges clearly in the case of light kinetically coupled spectator fields which is characterised by unphysical instabilities. As already pointed out, the spurious nature of this apparent destabilisation effect manifests itself in the basis-dependence of the time evolution of isocurvature perturbations which diverge in the kinematic basis whereas decay in the field space one. A more sophisticated analysis of the proper physical variable that should be used to describe entropy perturbations in multifield models should therefore be basis-independent, i.e. invariant under field reparametrisations. This investigation is however beyond the scope of our paper, and so we leave it for future work.

\section{Scalar and tensor power spectra}




Demonstrate how to compute the scalar and tensor power spectrum in the (N-A) regime. The problem is that we cannot relate this to observables, if the (V) regime is reached before the end of inflation, since then we don't know the overall e-fold we are at. Possible way out: choose parameters such that this regime is not reached before the end of inflation. \textit{Maybe better way out: in this section only, discuss SU(2)xU(1) model. I.e.\ the background evolution is as in standard abelian axion inflation (since we have demonstrated that the non-abelian contribution is subdominant for equal coupling), check here if there are relevant additional contributions to the power spectra (could be, due to linear contributions in stress-energy tensor).}
\begin{itemize}
\item scalar power spectrum: determined by $\delta \phi$ fluctuations computed above.
 \item Present general calculation of stochastic gravitational wave background produced from the enhanced gauge field modes.
 \item calculate stress energy tensor (see stress-energy tensor.pdf). 
 \item calculate tensor power spectrum. not linear contributions.
 \item equivalently: include eom for $\gamma_{ij}$ in coupled ODE system
 \item other pheno consequences?
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction\label{sec:introduction}}
The paradigm of cosmic inflation, proposed to explain the puzzling homogeneity and flatness of the Hot Big Bang Universe~\cite{Guth:1980zm}, has been strikingly successful in predicting the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), measured to great precision by the Planck satellite~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}. This paradigm however, leaves open questions. What guarantees the required flatness of the inflationary potential? How is the inflation sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics? The lack of observable predictions on far sub-horizon scales makes it very difficult to find satisfactory and testable answers to these questions. In this context, a special role is played by pseudo-scalar inflation models, in which the inflaton $\phi$ (the particle driving inflation) couples to the field strength tensor $F_{\mu \nu}$ of massless gauge fields through the derivative coupling $\phi F_{\mu \nu} \tilde F^{\mu \nu}$. This coupling is compatible with a shift-symmetry of the inflaton $\phi$ protecting the flatness if the inflationary potential, it provides an immediate way to couple the inflation sector to a gauge field sector (which could be the SM or a hidden sector) and it leads to distinctive signatures, including a strongly enhanced chiral gravitational wave background~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp}.

The phenomenology of these models, both for abelian and non-abelian gauge fields, has recently received a lot of interest. In both cases, the gauge field sector experiences a tachyonic instability during inflation, leading to an explosive particle production which impacts the predictions of inflation. 
For abelian gauge fields this instability is controlled by the inflaton velocity, implying large effects towards the end of inflation in single-field slow-roll inflation models whereas the CMB scales can be largely unaffected, see Ref.~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf} for an overview. The phenomenology of this model includes a strongly enhanced and non-Gaussian contribution to the scalar and tensor power spectra~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf,Barnaby:2011qe,Barnaby:2011vw,Shiraishi:2013kxa,Cook:2013xea}, which may lead to a distortion of the CMB black body spectrum~\cite{Meerburg:2012id}, primordial black hole (PBH) production~\cite{Linde:2012bt, Domcke:2017fix,Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw} and an enhanced chiral gravitational wave signal in the frequency band of LIGO and LISA~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Barnaby:2011qe,Barnaby:2011vw,Anber:2012du,Domcke:2016bkh,Bartolo:2016ami}. Furthermore, the effective friction induced by the gauge field allows for inflation on rather steep potentials~\cite{Anber:2009ua}. The interplay of the gauge fields with the production of charged fermions has been studied in~\cite{Domcke:2018eki} and validity of the perturbative analysis has been scrutinized in~\cite{Ferreira:2015omg, Peloso:2016gqs}. 
The coupling to non-abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge fields, dubbed chromo-natural inflation (CNI) in~\cite{Adshead:2012kp}, allows for inflationary solutions on steep potentials in the presence of a non-vanishing isotropic background gauge field configuration. An analysis of the perturbations~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012st,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka} revealed an enhanced tensor power spectrum, however to the degree of excluding the model as an explanation for the anisotropies in the CMB. The same conclusion holds in the regime where the scalar field can be integrated out~\cite{Namba:2013kia}, referred to as  gauge-flation~\cite{Maleknejad:2011jw,Maleknejad:2011sq} (see also~\cite{Adshead:2012qe,SheikhJabbari:2012qf}). 
Modifications to the original model can evade this conclusion by employing different inflation potentials~\cite{Caldwell:2017chz,DallAgata:2018ybl}, by enlarging the field content of the model~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2016fuu,McDonough:2018xzh} or by considering a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry~\cite{Adshead:2016omu}. 


In this paper we study the possibility of a dynamical emergence of CNI, under plausible assumptions that we will discuss in due course. In CNI, the gauge field background is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic and have a sufficiently large vacuum expectation value, so that the background evolution of the inflaton is dominated by the gauge friction term.  We show how such an isotropic background may develop from the regular Bunch--Davies initial conditions in the far past, providing justification for what is commonly taken for granted in CNI.\footnote{We emphasize that the mechanism presented in this paper is not a definitive solution to the problem of generating a background in CNI models: our arguments are based on a separation of length scales whose validity varies throughout the parameter space and should be explicitly verified in a dedicated lattice simulation.} For small gauge field amplitudes, the non-abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ dynamics reduce to three copies of an abelian gauge group. As the inflaton velocity increases over the course of inflation, the tachyonic enhancement of the gauge fields in the abelian regime triggers a classical, inherently non-abelian background evolution. In this background, only a single helicity component of the gauge field features a regime of tachyonic instability. Contrary to the abelian case, each Fourier mode experiences this instability only for a finite time interval. 
We provide analytical results which make only minimal assumptions about the values of the parameters involved.
For the explicit parameter example which we study numerically, we find the gauge friction term to be subdominant in the non-abelian regime, contrary to the usual assumption in CNI. We emphasize that the transition from an effectively abelian to a non-abelian regime is generic in single field axion inflation models, and naturally removes the tension of the original CNI model with the Planck data by delaying the enhancement of the tensor power spectrum to smaller scales. Moreover, this dynamical transition implies that the catastrophic instability in the scalar sector, arising in part of the parameter space as pointed out in~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew}, is generically avoided.




Throughout most of the paper we restrict ourselves to the linearized system of perturbations (see also~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012st,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka}). We however point out the importance of higher-order contributions to the scalar perturbation sector, taking into account that two enhanced helicity 2 gauge field perturbation can source helicity 0 (i.e.\ scalar) modes. We estimate the impact of this on the scalar power spectrum, finding an enhancement which is exponentially sensitive to the inflaton velocity, similar to what was found in the abelian case~\cite{Linde:2012bt}.\footnote{While this paper was being finalized, Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2018xnn,Papageorgiou:2018rfx} appeared, which also study the effects of the nonlinear coupling between the helicity $2$ and helicity $0$ perturbations. We briefly comment on these completely independent results in Sec.~\ref{sec:example}, finding overall good agreement within the expected uncertainties.}


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We begin with an executive summary in Sec.~\ref{sec:ExecutiveSummary}, to help  guide the reader through the different points discussed in this paper, followed by an overview on our notation in Sec.~\ref{sec:notation}. In Sec.~\ref{sec:axioninflation}, we review some of the key results and equations of abelian and non-abelian axion inflation, setting the notation for the following sections. Sec.~\ref{sec:background} is dedicated to the study of the emerging non-trivial homogeneous isotropic gauge field background. In Sec.~\ref{sec:linearized} we study the linearized system of perturbations in a general homogeneous isotropic gauge field background. This is applied to a specific parameter example in Sec.~\ref{sec:example}, showing explicitly the transition from the abelian to the non-abelian regime. We compute the resulting scalar and tensor power spectrum, taking into account non-linear contributions. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}. Six appendices deal with the derivation of the linearized perturbation equations, including the gravitational modes not included in the main text (App.~\ref{app:fulleom}), the explicit gauge field basis used in our linearized analysis (App.~\ref{app:basis}) details on the computation of the non-linear contributions to the scalar power spectrum (App.~\ref{app:variance_computation}), technical details supporting the analysis of the gauge field background (App.~\ref{app:sec3}), mathematical properties of homogeneous isotropic gauge fields (App.~\ref{app:gaugefields}) and analytical approximations of the Whittaker function describing the enhanced perturbation mode of the non-abelian regime (App.~\ref{app:asymptotics}).



\subsection{Executive summary \label{sec:ExecutiveSummary}}

To help guide the reader through the different aspects of our analysis, we give a preview of our key equations and results in this section, skipping all technical details. These results will be derived in the subsequent sections.

Our main focus will lie on the linearized regime of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ axion inflation. The pseudo-scalar (axion-like) inflaton $\phi$ is coupled to the field strength tensor of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge fields through the derivative coupling $\phi F_{\mu \nu} \tilde F^{\mu \nu}$. In the linearized regime, the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field\footnote{We adopt a common abuse of notation by referring to the gauge potential $A^a_\mu$ as the \emph{gauge field}.} $A_\mu^a$ can be decomposed into a homogeneous isotropic background $f(\tau)$ and perturbations $\delta A_\mu^a$:\footnote{See Sec.~\ref{sec:notation} for our index conventions.} 
\begin{equation}
 A_\mu^a(\tau, \vec x) = f(\tau) \delta^a_\mu + \delta A^a_\mu (\tau, \vec x) \,.
\end{equation}
The classical evolution of the background gauge field is governed by
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\textrm{d}^2}{\textrm{d} \tau^2}(e f) + 2 (e f)^3 - \frac{2 \xi}{(- \tau)} (e f)^2 = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
where $e$ denotes the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge coupling and $\xi$, encoding the velocity of the inflaton and defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_xi}, is typically taken to be ${\cal O}(1 - 10)$ during the last 60 e-folds of inflation. 

For a slowly evolving inflaton, $\xi \simeq const.$, the classical background evolution is focused around two attractor solutions\footnote{In Sec.~\ref{subsec:dynamical_background} and~\ref{subsec:gaugefluctuations} we comment on the difference between the background evolution studied in this paper and the ‘magnetic drift regime’ of~\cite{Adshead:2012kp,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew, Adshead:2013qp,  Adshead:2013nka}.},
\begin{equation}
 e f(\tau) = c_i \, \xi (- \tau)^{-1} \quad \text{with  } c_0 = 0 \,, \quad c_2 = \tfrac{1}{2} (1 + \sqrt{1 - 4/\xi^2}) \,,
\end{equation}
where the latter is only possible for $\xi \geq 2$. 
Beyond this classical motion, the background is also sourced by the fluctuations $\delta A^a_\mu$. These dominate the background evolution around the $c_0$-solution, and eventually trigger the transitions from the $c_0$ to the $c_2$ solution. For details see Sec.~\ref{sec:background}.

Out of the six physical degrees of freedom of the gauge field, the most important is the helicity $+2$ mode $w_{+2}$, which couples directly to the metric tensor mode, sourcing chiral gravitational waves (see also~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp}). In the $c_2$ background solution, its equation of motion 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\textrm{d}^2}{ \textrm{d} x^2} w_{+2}(x) + \left(1 - \frac{2 \xi}{x} + 2 \left(\frac{\xi}{x} - 1 \right) \frac{c_2 \xi}{x} \right) w_{+2}(x) = 0 \,,
 \label{eq:eom2Intro}
\end{equation}
(where $x = - k \tau$ with $k$ the momentum of the Fourier mode $w_{+2}$) has an exact solution in terms of the Whittaker function in the limit of constant $\xi$:
\begin{equation}
w_{+2}^{(e)}(x)=e^{(1+c_{2})\pi\xi/2}W_{-i \kappa,\,-i\mu}\left(-2ix\right) \,,
\label{eq:AnalyticalSolutionIntro}
\end{equation}
with $\kappa = (1 + c_2) \xi$ and  $\mu = \xi \sqrt{2 c_2 - (2 \xi)^{-2}}$. Due to a tachyonic instability in Eq.~\eqref{eq:eom2Intro} in between $x_\text{max,min} = (1 + c_2 \pm \sqrt{1 + c_2^2})\xi$, this solution is strongly enhanced just before horizon crossing. At and after horizon crossing, Eq.~\eqref{eq:AnalyticalSolutionIntro} is well approximated by
\begin{equation}
  \, w_{+2}(x) \simeq 2 e^{(\kappa - \mu) \pi} \sqrt{\frac{ x}{ \mu}} \cos\left[\mu \ln(2 x) + \theta_0 \right] \,.
\end{equation}
With this solution at hand, we can approximately analytically solve the 
coupled system of helicity $+2$ gauge fields and gravitational waves 
(see Eq.~\eqref{eq:+2mode}), obtaining for the gravitational wave amplitude $w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}$ after freeze-out on super-horizon scales
\begin{equation}
 x \, w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x) \big|_{x \geq 1} \simeq -  \frac{2 H \xi^{5/2}}{e } 2^{3/4} e^{(2 - \sqrt{2}) \pi \xi} \,,
\end{equation}
and consequently for the amplitude of the chiral stochastic gravitational wave background (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWapprox} for details),
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq \frac{1}{24} \Omega_r \left( \frac{\xi^3 H}{\pi M_P} \right)^2_{\xi = \xi_\text{cr}}  \left( \frac{2^{7/4} H}{e} \xi^{-1/2} e^{(2 - \sqrt{2}) \pi \xi}  \right)^2_{\xi = \xi_\text{ref}} \,.
\end{equation}

The scalar perturbations are not enhanced at the linear level in the parameter space in the focus of this work. However, non-linear contributions, sourced by two enhanced helicity $+2$ gauge field modes, yield an exponentially enhanced contribution to the scalar power spectrum. We report analytical estimates for the resulting contribution to the scalar power spectrum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ds_2nd}. 

Combining the results on the background evolution and the analysis of the perturbations, the following picture emerges: At early times, deep in de-Sitter space with small values of $\xi$, the non-abelian axion inflation model reduces to the abelian regime. Two factors are necessary to trigger the transition to the inherently non-abelian regime: The $c_2$ solution of the classical background emerges at $\xi \geq 2$ and the gauge field fluctuations have to reach a sufficient amplitude to trigger initial conditions for the classical motion which actually lead to the $c_2$ solution. We emphasize that the linearized description of this transition is based on two assumptions, which we will justify in Secs.~\ref{sec:axioninflation} and \ref{sec:linearized}, respectively: (i) the gauge fields sourced in the abelian regime are approximately homogeneous over a Hubble patch and (ii) the gauge field fluctuations in the non-abelian regime are small compared to this homogeneous background.\footnote{A quantification of the resulting uncertainties on our final results most likely requires a lattice simulation of the full non-linear theory in de Sitter space. Current state-of-the-art techniques~\cite{Adshead:2015pva,Cuissa:2018oiw} can however only evolve this system for a few Hubble times, insufficient to address this question. We hope that this work will trigger future research in this direction. }

As a proof of concept, we study a parameter example in Sec.~\ref{sec:example} in which the CMB scales exit the horizon in the abelian regime at relatively small $\xi$ (thus ensuring agreement with all CMB observations), whereas smaller scales exit the horizon after the transition to the inherently non-abelian regime. The resulting scalar and tensor power spectra are strongly enhanced at small scales, see Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraPS} and \ref{fig:spectraGW}.

\subsection{Notation and conventions \label{sec:notation}}
We summarize here the main conventions used throughout this paper. The metric signature is $(-,+,+,+)$ and we mostly employ conformal time $\tau$ instead of cosmic time $t$. Derivatives with respect to the conformal time are denoted by a prime, while derivatives with respect to the cosmic time are denoted by a dot. We often use the dimensionless variable
\begin{equation}
x = - k \tau \,.
\end{equation}
The first (second) derivative of the functional 
$\mathcal{S}(\phi)$
with respect to the field $\phi$ is denoted by 
$\mathcal{S}_{, \phi}$ ($\mathcal{S}_{, \phi \phi}$). 
The Fourier transform of the function  
$F(t,\vec{x})$
(or similarly for
$F(\tau,\vec{x})$)
is given by
\begin{equation}
F(t,\vec{x}) = \int \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k}}{\left(2 \pi\right)^{3/2}} \, \tilde{F}(t,\vec{k}) e^{-i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{x}} \,.
\end{equation}
(Anti-)Symmetrization is defined as
\begin{equation}
S_{(ij)} = \frac{S_{ij} + S_{ji}}{2} \,, \qquad A_{[ij]} = \frac{A_{ij} - A_{ji}}{2} \,.
\end{equation}
Greek letters refer to space-time indices ($\mu = 0, 1, 2, 3$), roman letters from the beginning of the alphabet refer to gauge indices (e.g. $a = 1, 2, 3$ for a $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge group) and roman letters from the middle of the alphabet refer to spatial indices ($i = 1, 2, 3$). We use the usual conventions for $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge fields $\mathbf{A}_\mu = A^a_\mu \mathbf{T}_a$. The field strength tensor is defined as 
\begin{equation}
	F^a_{\mu\nu} \mathbf{T}_a \equiv \mathbf{F}_{\mu\nu} \equiv \frac{i}{e}[\mathbf{D}_{\mu},\mathbf{D}_{\nu} ] = \partial_\mu \mathbf{A}_{\nu} - \partial_\nu \mathbf{A}_{\mu} - i e[\mathbf{A}_{\mu},\mathbf{A}_{\nu}]  \; ,
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the coupling constant, $\mathbf{T}_a$ is the $a$-th generator of the group, $\mathbf{A}_{\mu} \equiv A^a_{\mu} \mathbf{T}_a$ and where we have used the definition of covariant derivative:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{D}_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} - i e \mathbf{A}_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} - i e A^a_{\mu} \mathbf{T}_a\; .
\end{equation} 
With the commutation relation
\begin{equation}
	 [\mathbf{T}_a, \mathbf{T}_b] = i \varepsilon_{abc}  \mathbf{T}_c \; ,
\end{equation}
 the field strength can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:field_strength}
	F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A^a_{\nu} - \partial_\nu A^a_{\mu} + e \varepsilon^{abc} A^b_{\mu}A^c_{\nu} \; .
\end{equation}
The dual tensor to the field strength is defined as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}_a^{\mu \nu} = \frac{\varepsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}}{2 \sqrt{-g}} F^a_{\rho \sigma} \,,
\end{equation}
where we use the convention $\varepsilon^{0123} = 1$ for the anti-symmetric tensor. Additional conventions related to the computation of the equations of motion in the ADM formalism are reported in App.~\ref{app:fulleom}.

\section{Introduction}
One of the most important parameters of the homogeneous Friedman-Lemaitre-Robinson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological scenario is the spatial curvature of the universe $k=0,\pm 1$, which provides a model independent contribution to the energy density $\Omega_k=-k/(aH)^2$ for  a scale factor $a$ and Hubble parameter $H$. Current observations favour an almost flat universe with the Planck data 2018~\cite{Planck:2018jri} reporting $\Omega_k=-0.0007\pm 0.0019$. Combined with BAO observations this lead to a universe consistent with exactly flat but with a margin of error slightly preferring a closed universe. The statistical significance and error bar of these results is a question of current debate
 (see for instance \cite{Handley:2019tkm,DiValentino:2020hov} and  \cite{Efstathiou:2020wem} for  opposing views). As further observations improve with time, the parameter range for $\Omega_k$ could be determined with higher precision. 

Determining the value of $k$ is of crucial importance to understand the early and late stages of the universe. For the early stages, simple solvable models of quantum cosmology assume that the universe has a  closed geometry, amongst them the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal~\cite{Hartle:1983ai} and the tunnelling proposal~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de,Vilenkin:1984wp}, Whereas the standard interpretation of Coleman-De Luccia vacuum transitions hints at an open universe (however see for instance~\cite{Cespedes:2020xpn} 
%I do not see any reason to cite FMP here - they do not discuss closed universes.
for an alternative proposal). For the later stages of the universe, if it is closed ($k=+1$) its spatial volume is finite, whereas if it is flat or open the spatial volume is infinite and therefore the future evolution of the universe would be substantially different.

Despite the fact that the universe appears to be very close to being flat, and that we may never get the precision to be good enough to disentangle its curvature, it is still important to establish to what extent the curvature of the universe may lead to observable implications. If inflation is the correct description of the early universe and the number of e-foldings is much larger than the minimum needed to solve the horizon problem this task may be hopeless. However there is a possibility if the number of e-foldings is close to critical that we may be able to observe signatures of the curvature.

It is a well known fact that curvature perturbations produced during inflation are very close to Gaussian. Deviations from this are called non-Gaussianities and are constrained to be very suppressed by observations~\cite{Planck:2019kim}.  Even so, their detection would reveal crucial information about the physics of the early universe and there are a number of currently running and planned experiments looking for them, including CMB experiments such as CMB-S4~\cite{CMB-S4:2016ple}, The Simons Observatory~\cite{SimonsObservatory:2018koc} and PICO~\cite{Alvarez:2019rhd}; large scale structure surveys including for instance DESI~\cite{Font-Ribera:2013rwa}, SKA~\cite{Maartens:2015mra}, Vera-Rubin telescope~\cite{LSSTScience:2009jmu} and SPHEREX~\cite{Dore:2014cca}.

There has been a large amount of progress in understanding non-Gaussianities from inflation. A particularly important point is that, for a flat universe, single field  attractor models of inflation predict a very weak local non-Gaussianity, which is phrased  as  $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = \frac{5(n_s-1)}{12}$~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr}, with $n_s$ the spectral index. This result shows that measuring a $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = \mathcal{O}(1)$ would mean that at least one of the assumptions behind the derivation of this result is violated, e.g. the single field inflation assumption. Other models of inflation can produce a larger signal  in different limits of the bispectrum shape and so non-Gaussianity becomes a way of distinguishing between different  mechanisms. For instance adding higher derivative interactions can modify the action for the perturbations starting at the quadratic level. This is usually parametrised in terms of the speed of sound $c_s$ at which the perturbations propagate. A low speed of sound can produce a large non-Gaussianity signal $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim c_s^{-2}$ which for low $c_s$ can be much larger than the one produced gravitationally~\cite{Chen:2006nt,Cheung:2007st}. Interactions with other fields can also produce different signals, particularly in the squeezed limit~\cite{Sasaki:2006kq,Chen:2009zp,Arkani-Hamed:2015bza}. 
 
Another alternative, which we will explore in this work, is through the presence of curvature in the early universe. The presence of a remnant curvature breaks the scale invariance at large scales producing a particular signal. Since curvature is diluted due to the expansion of the universe this effect is expected to be small, but there may still be room for a possible observational effect, given the fact that current bounds still allow for a detectable effect \cite{Handley:2019tkm,DiValentino:2020hov} (however see \cite{Efstathiou:2020wem}).
 
In this work we develop the formalism to compute the power spectrum of density perturbations for a closed universe and determine the Bunch-Davis vacuum, two-point and higher functions.\footnote{See\cite{Halliwell:1984eu,Seery:2010kh, Ratra:2017ezv,Handley:2019anl,Avis:2019eav}  for related work on closed universes and  \cite{Bucher:1994gb,Yamamoto:1996qq,Sugimura:2013cra} for works on the perturbations on a open Universe} In particular we will compute the non-Gaussian signatures of a closed universe. To do so we will start from a mini-superspace model which can be solved by assuming slow-roll evolution. Using this solution we will build a Schr\"odinger equation for the perturbations which allows us to compute correlation functions of the perturbations at any order. Since the solutions are expressed in terms of spherical harmonics, instead of Fourier modes, they look very different. Nevertheless it is possible to define a flat space limit in which the spherical harmonic modes reduce to Fourier modes. Doing so, we will show that at large scales there are large differences between different geometries. Moreover, since the background evolution is different, if the curvature has not been totally diluted at the time of the CMB, there are interesting observable signals. In particular there is a topological term, i.e. one that depends on whether the Universe is closed or not,  with a three-point function which is not slow-roll suppressed although it is negligible at small scales.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Formalism} we consider a minisuperspace model of inflation along with the scalar perturbations for a closed universe. By using the WKB method we show how to solve the equations to find the wave-function  to arbitrary order expanding on $S^3$ harmonics. In Sec.~\ref{sec:PNG} we employ this method to find the primordial non-Gaussian three-point function and we compute a generalisation of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ valid on a closed universe. We also study a generalisation of the effective field theory of inflation valid for a closed universe. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusions} we analyse the potential observability of our results and we conclude. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Notation:}}
We will use the global de Sitter metric $ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2d\Omega_3^2$ where $t$ is cosmic time, $a(t)$ the scale factor and $d\Omega_3^2$ the metric on $S_2$. This metric covers the whole spacetime and $t$ runs from $-\infty$ in the past to $\infty$ in the future.. We will encounter other notions of time whose notation we summarise here  for easy reference.
\begin{itemize}
\item[$t$]: cosmic Lorentzian time.
\item[$\eta$]: conformal Lorentzian time, running from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$.
\item[$\tau$]: Euclidean time.
\item[$T$]: conformal Euclidean time, running from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
\end{itemize}
We define spherical harmonics in $S_3$ as $Y_{p, l m} $ are spherical harmonics labelled by $p$, $l$ and $m$ with $p \geq l \geq 0$ and $-l \geq m \geq l$. 
The Laplacian obeys $\nabla^2_{\mathrm{S}^3}Y_{p, l, m}=-p(p+2)Y_{p, l, m}$, and the functions are normalised such that $\int d\Omega Y_{p, l, m}Y^*_{p', l', m'}=\delta_{pp'}\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}$. Also  $Y_{p, l, -m} = (-1)^{m}Y^*_{p,  l, m}$.

\section{Inflation and interactions in a closed universe}
\label{sec:Formalism}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hamiltonian Approach}

We will start the discussion with a model of  a scalar field coupled to gravity with action given by,
\begin{equation}
S=\int d^4 x\sqrt{-g} \left[M_{Pl}^2 R-\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi-V(\phi)\right] \,.
\end{equation}
Assuming that there is a time-dependent homogeneous background with the (FLRW or minisuperspace) metric 
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=-N^{2}(t)dt^{2}+a^{2}(t)(dr^{2}+\sin^{2}rd\Omega_{2}^{2}) \,. \label{eq:minimetric}
\end{equation}
For convenience we will separate the action for the scale factor $S_g$ from the action for the scalar field $S_m$. In terms of Eq.~\eqref{eq:minimetric} we have that the action becomes $S=S_{g}+S_{m}$, 
with 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{g} & = &M_{Pl}^2\int dt d^3 x\left(-N^{-1}3a\dot{a}^{2}+3aN\right) \,,\label{eq:Sg}\\
S_{m} & = & \int dt d^3 x\left(N^{-1}\frac{1}{2}a^{3}\dot{\phi}^{2}-Na^{3}((\partial_i\phi)^2+V(\phi))\right) \,.
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the metric assumes a closed universe, with the curvature component appearing in the last term of $S_g$.
We will be interested in potentials that achieve inflation. The equations of motion for the background field $\phi=\phi(t)$ and the scale factor are,
\begin{align}
H^2\equiv\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2&=\frac{1}{3M_{Pl}^2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2+V(\phi)\right)-\frac{1}{a^2} \,,\\
0&=\ddot\phi+3H\dot\phi+V_{,\phi} \,.
\end{align}
Inflation is achieved when the comoving horizon $1/(aH)$ shrinks. This is obtained when $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{aH}\right)<0$, which is equivalent to $\ddot a>0$. This condition can be written as,
\begin{align}
\frac{\ddot a}{a}=H^2\left(1+\frac{\dot H}{H^2}\right) \,,
\end{align}
so inflation lasts as long as $-\dot H/H^2 <1$. This can be phrased in terms of the scalar field using the equations of motion, 
 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:Epsilon}
\frac{\vert\dot H\vert}{H^2}-\frac{1}{a^2H^2}=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}^2}\frac{\dot\phi^2}{2H^2} \equiv \epsilon \,.
 \end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is the slow-roll parameter. Note that in contrast to flat space, there is an extra term that corresponds to the curvature, but both definitions coincide once the curvature dilutes away. Moreover, initially  $\epsilon$ being small does not necessarily imply that the comoving horizon  is shrinking. This puts a  lower bound on the duration of inflation to satisfy current bounds on the curvature.   To avoid confusion  we will  assume that after the curvature dilutes inflation lasts as long as $\epsilon\ll 1$.
In fact at horizon exit for the longest CMB modes the curvature $1/(a^2H^2)\lesssim 0.001$ so  in the region of interest the two definitions are essentially the same.

We will be interested in the perturbations of the scalar field during the slow-roll evolution. This can be obtained by using the ADM formalism and we refer the reader to Appendix~\ref{sec:ADMPert} for a derivation. In terms of the field perturbation $\varphi$ and in flat gauge, the action is given by,

\begin{equation}
S_\varphi=\frac{1}{2}\int dt\ d^3 x\  a^{3}\sqrt{\gamma}\left(N^{-1}\dot\varphi^2-\frac{N}{a^2}\gamma^{ij}\partial_i\varphi\partial_j\varphi+\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}(N,\varphi)\right) \,,\label{eq:PertAction}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the metric over the unit 3-sphere and $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}(N,\varphi)$ parametrises higher order interactions. As it is shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:ADMPert}, in flat gauge  the dependence on $M_{Pl}^2$ does not appear explicitly. Instead, when the action is  in the comoving gauge the factor of $M_{Pl}^2$ reappears (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:actioncomovinggaguge}).  The action for the perturbations in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PertAction} is then   proportional to $M_{Pl}^2\dot\phi$, which implies that the  perturbation field  only makes sense when the slow-roll parameters are small but non vanishing.

 In order to study the dynamics of this system we will first need the   conjugate momenta,
\begin{align}
&\pi_{N}=0\,, \qquad \pi_{a}=-M_{Pl}^2 N^{-1}6a\dot{a} \,,\label{eq:momenta}\nonumber\\
&\pi_{\phi}=N^{-1}a^{3}\dot{\phi} \,, \qquad \pi_{\varphi}=N^{-1}a^3\sqrt{\gamma}\dot\varphi \,.
\end{align}
The Hamiltonian is $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_0+\mathcal{H}_\varphi$, ${\cal H}_0$ is the Hamiltonian from the background (minisuperspace) and ${\cal H}_\varphi$ is the Hamiltonian for the perturbations
\begin{align}
{\cal H}_0&=N\left(-\frac{1}{M_{Pl}^2}\frac{\pi_{a}^{2}}{12a}+\frac{\pi_{\phi}^{2}}{2a^{3}}-3aM_{Pl}^2+a^{3}V(\phi)\right) \,,\label{eq:calH}\nonumber\\
{\cal H}_\varphi&=N\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}}\frac{\pi_\varphi^2}{2 a^3}+\sqrt{\gamma}a\gamma^{ij}\partial_i\varphi\partial_j\varphi\right)+{\cal H}_{\mathrm{int}} \,.
\end{align}
We will be interested in solving the Wheeler-de Witt (WDW) equation (the quantum version of the classical Hamiltonian constraint) which, in this case, can be written as $\left(\mathcal{H}_0+\mathcal{H}_\varphi\right)\Psi=0$ and where we need to make the identification,
\begin{equation}
\pi_a=-i\frac{\delta}{\delta a},\qquad\pi_\phi=-i\frac{\delta}{\delta\phi},\qquad\pi_\varphi=-i\frac{\delta}{\delta\varphi}.
\end{equation}

Note that we are neglecting tensor and vector perturbations. For general models  vector perturbations decay during inflation. Tensor perturbations are decoupled up to second order from scalar perturbations. Its action can be studied using similar methods as those that we will describe below.

We will now transform the WDW equation into a Schr\"odinger equation for the perturbations. To do this we will first need to solve the equation for the background. This can be achieved by using the slow-roll conditions.
Indeed, (for a closed universe with $1/(aH)^2\ll 1$) we have that,
\begin{align}
\epsilon= \frac{1}{M_{Pl}^2}\frac{\dot\phi^2}{2H^2}=3 a^2M_{Pl}^2\frac{\pi_\phi^2}{\pi_a^2}\ll 1 \,,
\end{align}
hence in the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_0$ we can neglect the scalar field  momentum since it is negligible compared to $\pi_a$. We solve using the Born-Oppenheimer procedure as used in this context for example in~\cite{Banks:1984cw}. This amounts to expanding in powers of $M_{\rm Pl}^2$ and solving  up to terms $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Pl}^0)$. In doing so it is necessary to take the potential to scale as $M_{\rm Pl}^2$ so that in the decoupling limit $M_{\rm Pl}^2\rightarrow\infty$ one has a de Sitter solution for the background. The solution  then takes the form  $\Psi=\psi(a)\chi(a,\varphi)$ where 
$\psi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{dS_0/da}}\exp\left(iM_{Pl}^2 S_0\right)$ corresponds to the  minisuperspace semi-classical wave-function (with pre-factor) and $\chi(a,\varphi)$ corresponds to the perturbations in that background.

$S_0$ is the solution of
\begin{equation}
-\frac{M_{Pl}^2}{12a}\left(\frac{\delta S_0}{\delta a}\right)^2 +a^3 V(\phi)-3aM_{Pl}^2=0 \,,
\end{equation} 
which is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for minisuperspace. 
Here the function $f(a,\phi)=a^3 V(\phi)-3aM_{Pl}^2$ can be considered as an effective scalar potential for $a$ and $\phi$. For $V>0$ this has a barrier in the $a$ direction for $a<\sqrt{3/V}M_{Pl}$ (remembering that $a$ has the wrong sign of the kinetic term).
In the under the barrier region $a^3V<3a M_{Pl}^2$ we get \footnote{A factor $2\pi^2$ corresponding to the volume of the unit three sphere has been inserted in the formulae for $S_0$.},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:S0underthebarrier}
S_0=\pm 12\pi^2i \int da a \sqrt{1-\frac{a^2 V}{3M_{Pl}^2}}=\mp i \frac{12\pi^2M_{Pl}^2}{V}\left(1-\frac{a^2V}{3M_{Pl}^2}\right)^{3/2} \,.
\end{equation}
In the over the barrier region $a^3V>3aM_{Pl}^2$ we have instead
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:S0overthebarrier}
S_0=\pm 12\pi^2 \int da a \sqrt{\frac{a^2 V}{3M_{Pl}^2}-1}=\pm  \frac{12\pi^2M_{Pl}^2}{V}\left(\frac{a^2 V}{3M_{Pl}^2}-1\right)^{3/2} \,.
\end{equation}
The two classical solutions imply that $\psi$ is a superposition of two components: under the barrier one has an exponentially rising and an exponentially falling component, while in the classically allowed region the solution is a superposition of expanding and contracting components.
 
\begin{equation}
\pi_a=M_{Pl}^2\frac{\partial S_0}{\partial a}=-12\pi^2M_{Pl}^2N^{-1}a\dot a \,.\label{eq:pi}
\end{equation} 
At $\mathcal{O}(M_{Pl}^0)$ we have a Schr\"odinger equation for $\chi$
\begin{equation}
\frac{i}{12\pi^2 a} \frac{\delta S_0	}{\delta a}\frac{\delta\chi}{\delta a}+\mathcal{H}_\varphi\chi=0 \,, \label{eq:NLO}
\end{equation}
provided that $a$ plays the role of time. In fact from Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi} we see that the first term of this equation is 
$-i\partial /\partial t$ so that we have 
\begin{equation}
\left(i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\mathcal{H}_\varphi\right)\chi=0 \,, \label{eq:Schrodinger}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to the Schr\"odinger equation in real time for the modes over the barrier.

For the under the barrier modes there is a factor of $\pm i$ in the expression for $\frac{\partial S_0}{\partial a}$ so that in order to have real $a$ we need to put $t=\pm i \tau$.  Hence Eq.~\eqref{eq:NLO} in the under barrier case becomes
\begin{equation}
\left(\mp\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}+\mathcal{H}_\varphi\right)\chi=0 \,, \label{eq:EucSchrodinger}
\end{equation}
which is a Euclidean  Schr\"odinger equation for the perturbations. The solutions for $a$ can be obtained by assuming that $\epsilon\ll 1$, which implies that the potential is approximately constant. This of course  reduces to the Euclidean and Lorenzian versions of de Sitter space i.e. \footnote{It is possible to obtain the contracting branch of global de Sitter by a different choice of initial conditions}
\begin{align}
a&= \sqrt{\frac{3M_{Pl}^2}{V}}\sin{\left(\sqrt{\frac{V}{3}}\frac{\tau}{M_{Pl}}\right)},\qquad\mathrm{for}\ a^3V<3aM_{Pl}^2,~0<\sqrt{\frac{V}{3}}\frac{\tau}{M_{Pl}}<\pi/2 \,,\label{eq:a_underthebarrier}\\
a&= \sqrt{\frac{3M_{Pl}^2}{V}}\cosh{\left(\sqrt{\frac{V}{3}}\frac{t}{M_{Pl}}\right)},\qquad\mathrm{for}\ a^3V>3aM_{Pl}^2,\,~t>0 \,.
\label{eq:a_overthebarrier}
\end{align}

 Now the fact that we observe an expanding universe led Vilenkin~\cite{Vilenkin:1986cy} to propose that the wave function in the classical region should have just the outgoing wave component. This is the so-called tunneling wave function. However the WKB matching conditions then imply that one needs both components (the rising as well as the falling) exponentials inside the barrier with equal amplitude (apart from a phase). It appears that this is incompatible with choosing the Bunch-Davies vacuum for the fluctuations. Instead one needs to choose the Hartle-Hawking (HH) wave function~\cite{Hartle:1983ai}\footnote{For a recent discussion see \cite{deAlwis:2018sec, DiTucci:2019bui}  where it is shown that the tunneling wave function while it has Gaussian fluctuations as is the case for the HH wave-function, is unstable to quartic fluctuations unlike the HH one.}.

 In the classically allowed region the latter is a cosine function, implying that it is a superposition of expanding and contracting universes. Thus we need to assume that the two components de-cohere and so we may just focus on the expanding one where the Schr\"odinger equation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Schrodinger} is satisfied. On the other hand in the classically forbidden region one has only the rising component (corresponding to the lower sign in Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0underthebarrier}) which is effectively exponentially suppressed at $a=0$.  We note therefore for future reference that going from the real time Schr\"odinger equation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Schrodinger} to the Euclidean version in Eq.~\eqref{eq:EucSchrodinger} (with the lower sign) corresponds to putting $t=+i\tau$.
 
 \subsubsection{Bunch-Davies vacuum}

To find the vacuum let us first solve the equations of motion for the quadratic actions for the perturbation. We assume that spacetime is a fixed de Sitter such that the metric is given by \begin{align}
a^2(t)=\frac{1}{H^2}\cosh^2 (H t) \,,
\end{align}
where $t$ is cosmic time and we defined $M_{Pl}^{2}H^2=V/3$.
It is convenient to decompose $\varphi$ in terms of spherical harmonics
\begin{equation}
\varphi(x)=\sum _{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, m}(t)Y_{p, l, m}(\Omega) \,,
\end{equation}
where $Y_{p, l m} $ are spherical harmonics labelled by $p$, $l$ and $m$ with $p \geq l \geq 0$ and $-l \geq m \geq l$. 
The Laplacian obeys $\nabla^2_{\mathrm{S}^3}Y_{p, l, m}=-p(p+2)Y_{p, l, m}$, and the functions are normalised such that $\int d\Omega Y_{p, l, m}Y^*_{p', l', m'}=\delta_{pp'}\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}$. Also  $Y_{p, l, -m} = (-1)^{m}Y^*_{p,  l, m}$.

In this section we will find the solution which corresponds to the Bunch-Davies vacuum both in the Euclidean region (i.e. under the barrier) and in the Lorentzian region (i.e. over the barrier).

\subsubsection*{Euclidean region}

Let us first solve the region under the barrier.
Due to the spherical symmetry the Euclidean action becomes, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EuclideanQuadraticAction}
S_2=\sum_{p, l, m}\int d\tau \ a^3\left(|\varphi'_{p, l, m}|^2+p(p+2)\frac{|\varphi_{p, l, m}|^2}{a^2}\right) \,.
\end{equation} 
Where $'$ denotes derivative with respect to Euclidean time $\tau$.
The Hamiltonian density is then
\begin{align}
H=\sum_{p, l, m} \bigg[\frac{\pi_\varphi^2}{a^3}+p(p+2)a \varphi_{p, l, m} \bigg] \,.
\end{align}
Let us assume the Gaussian ansatz for the wave-function 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi}
\chi=\exp\bigg(\sum_{p, l, m}c_p(\tau)\varphi_{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m}\bigg) \,,
\end{equation}
so the time dependence is in the coefficient $c_p$ whereas $\varphi_p$ is a field profile, and where $\varphi_{p, l, m}^*=\varphi_{p, l, -m}$. By making the identification
\begin{align}
\pi_\varphi\to-i\frac{\delta}{\delta\varphi} \,,
\end{align}
in the Hamiltonian of Eq.~\eqref{eq:EucSchrodinger} then gives, using the ansatz in Eq.~\eqref{eq:chi},
\begin{align}
\partial_\tau c_p=-a^{-3}c_p^{2}+a p(p+2) \,.
\end{align}
It is also convenient to write the equations in term of conformal Euclidean time such that, $ds^2=a(T)^2(dT^2+d\Omega_3^2)$ where $T$ goes from $-\infty$ in the past to $\infty$ in the future. Then the scale factor in Eq.~\eqref{eq:a_underthebarrier} becomes,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EuclideanScaleFactor}
a(T)=H^{-1}\sech(T) \,,
\end{equation}
and the Schr\"odinger equation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Schrodinger} becomes
\begin{equation}
\partial_T c_p +a^{-2} c_p^2-a^{2}p(p+2)=0 \,.
\end{equation}
To solve this equation we put $c_p=a^2\partial_T f_p/f_p$ where $f_p$ satisfies the linear eqn.
\begin{equation}
\partial_T\left(a^2 \partial_T f\right)=a^2(p(p+2))f \,.
\end{equation}
This is in fact the ‘radial’ equation coming from the 4D Laplace equation in the metric of Eq.~\eqref{eq:minimetric} in Euclidean conformal coordinates in the gauge $N=1$, i.e. $ds^2=a^2(T)(dT^2+d\Omega_3^2)$. To solve this equation we take  the scale factor  given by the de Sitter solution  $a(T)=H^{-1}\sech(T)$. Imposing the solutions to be regular at $a=0$ which in these coordinates correspond to $T\to-\infty$, we get that the mode function is,\footnote{In the case the field has a mass $m_\phi$ the equation  changes to $\partial_T\left(a^2 \partial_T f\right)=a^2(p(p+2))f+ a^4 m_\phi^2 f$ the solutions are
\begin{align}
f_p(T)&=C_1 \left(\frac{\sech(T)}{2}\right)^{p/2} \, _2F_1\left(p+\Delta,p+3-\Delta;p-1;\frac{1}{2} -\frac{\tanh (T)}{2}\right)\nonumber\\&+C_2 \left(\frac{\sech(T)}{2}\right)^{p/2} \, _2F_1\left(p+\Delta,p+3-\Delta;p+2; \frac{\tanh (T)}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $\Delta=3/2-\nu=3/2-\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}-\frac{m_\phi^2}{H^2}}$.
\begin{align}
f_p(T)=C_1(\sinh(T)-(p+1)\cosh(T))e^{(p+1)T} \,.
\end{align}
The normalization factor $C_1$ can be found by imposing the canonical commutation relations (we will show it explicitly in the Lorentzian case below).}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:modefunctionEuclid}
f_p(T) = \frac{H (\sinh(T)-(p+1)\cosh(T))e^{(p+1)T}}{\sqrt{2p(p+1)(p+2)}} \,.
\end{equation}
For future reference, given Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunctionEuclid}, one can compute the functions $c_p = a^2 \partial_T f_p/f_p$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clE}
c_p = \frac{1}{H^2} \frac{p (p+2)\sech^2 T}{\cosh^2 T (1 + p - \tanh T)} \,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Lorentzian region}

In the over the barrier region the wave-function is given by $\chi \simeq\exp(i\sum_{p, l, m}c_p(\eta)\varphi_{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m})$. The scale factor is now given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:a_overthebarrier}, which in conformal time $\eta$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LorentzianScaleFactor}
a(\eta)=H^{-1}\sec(\eta) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ runs from $0$ to $\pi/2$ which corresponds to the classical  expanding phase that starts  at $\eta=0$. The equation for the perturbations is,
\begin{equation}
-\partial_\eta(a^2\partial_\eta f_p)=a^2p(p+2)f_p \,, \label{eq:Lorentizanequation}
\end{equation}
where  $c_p=- a^2\partial_\eta f/f$. We find the solution to this equation in Appendix~\ref{sec:solution_eq} to be  given by
\begin{equation}
f_p=C_1((1+p)\cos\ \eta+i\sin\ \eta )e^{-i(p+1)\eta}+C_2 ((1+p)\cos\ \eta-i\sin\ \eta )e^{+i(p+1)\eta} \,.
\label{eq:generalsolutionLorentzian}
\end{equation}
In order to define a vacuum let us recall that in flat de Sitter this is defined by picking an incoming wave  deep inside the bulk. In this limit the physical momenta $k/aH\gg 1$ and the spacetime can be well approximated by Minkowski spacetime. In other words the Bunch-Davies vacuum is defined as the one that reduces to the Minkowski vacuum in the sub-horizon limit. For a closed universe we cannot take arbitrarily small values of $a$ without going under the barrier. A solution that leads to a Bunch-Davies vacuum  is to impose that the mode function in Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalsolutionLorentzian} has to be also a solution in the Euclidean region~\cite{Laflamme:1987mx}. From Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunctionEuclid} we find that this can only happens when $C_2=0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalsolutionLorentzian} since the Euclidean limit correspond to $\eta\to iT$ the choice of sign being that corresponding to the Hartle-Hawking choice for the wave function $\psi$ - see paragraph below Eq.~\eqref{eq:a_underthebarrier}.\\

In order to fix the remaining constant we impose the Klein-Gordon normalization over the mode function.
This reduces to $\vert C_1\vert^2(2p(p+1)(p+2))=H^2$ so we finally find that 
\begin{equation}
f_p=H \frac{((p+1)\cos\ \eta+i\sin\ \eta )e^{-i(p+1)\eta}}{\sqrt{2p(p+1)(p+2)}} \,. \label{eq:modefunction}
\end{equation}
We would like to compare this result to the flat space mode function $f_k\sim\frac{e^{-ik\eta}}{k^{3/2}}(i+k\eta)$ where $\eta$ is conformal time and $a=-1/(H\eta)$. The analogy  is not exact but if we look at the limit $\eta\to\pi/2$ then both scale similarly at large $l$: $f_k \sim k^{-3/2}$ and $f_p \sim p^{-3/2}$. Moreover when $\eta$ is close to zero the closed mode function scales similarly as the Minkowski vacuum. For future reference we also write down the expression for the functions $c_p = - a^2 \partial_\eta f_p/f_p$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clL}
c_p = i \frac{p (p+2) \sec^2 \eta}{H^2 (1 + p + i \tan \eta)} \,.
\end{equation}
Let us now make some comments about these results. Notice that in getting Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunction} we need to impose conditions over Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalsolutionLorentzian} at $a=0$. In the more general case that the condition is imposed at other value of the scale factor it will imply that there are growing and decaying modes at $\dot a=0$ instead of only decaying. This then translates into a more general solution for the coefficients of Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalsolutionLorentzian}.\\

Before continuing, let us stress again  that  the  derivation of the mode functions assumed that under the barrier the scalar field was almost static. This assumption can in principle  be dropped provided that there is a  classical solution. This is because, in the end to form a Schr\"odinger equation all that we need is to use a classical solution to introduce a clock. Generalisations to other potentials have been considered  in~\cite{Banks:1984np,Halliwell:1984eu}. The fact that there it is possible to define a WKB expansion in the context of slow-roll  inflation has  explained more recently in~\cite{Janssen:2020pii}.

\subsubsection*{Wave function and two-point correlators}

Let us now compute  the wave-function.\footnote{Alternatively it is possible to define the fields in the Schr\"odinger picture~\cite{Luscher:1985iu,Long:1996wf} where the fundamental object is the wave-function coefficient rather than the mode function.} Plugging back Eq.~\eqref{eq:clL} into the wave-function we have that,
 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:WaveFunction1}
 \chi=\exp\left(-i\sum_{p, l, m}   \frac{\sec \eta}{2H^2} \frac{p (p+2)}{i(p+l)\cos \eta-\sin \eta}\varphi_{p,l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m}\right)\,.
 \end{align}
Expanding for $\eta$ close to $\pi/2$ we find
 \begin{align}
 \chi=\exp\left(i\sum_{p,l,m}\frac{1}{2H^2}\left(-\frac{p(p+2)}{\eta-\pi/2}+i p(p+1)(p+2)+\mathcal O(\eta-\pi/2)\right)\varphi_{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m}\right) \,.
 \label{eq:wavefunction_latetime}
 \end{align}
Notice that the divergent piece is a pure phase while the leading order quadratic contribution is given by $\chi \simeq \exp(-\sum_{p,l,m}p(p+1)(p+2)\vert\varphi_{p, l, m}\vert^2)$. Notice that picking the other Euclidean solution (which corresponds to the analytic continuation $T\to-i\eta$) the real piece picks an overall plus sign and the perturbations grow. 

From the wave-function we can compute the two point function to be,
 \begin{align}
 \langle\varphi_p^2\rangle= \frac{H^2}{2p(p+1)(p+2)} \,.
 \label{eq:2point_function}
 \end{align}
 In order to compare it to observations we need to compute the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, which at linear order  and after horizon crossing is given by $\zeta_*=-(H/\dot\phi) \varphi_*$ where the asterisk denotes horizon crossing.\footnote{This corresponds to transforming to the  comoving gauge which is  explained in Appendix~\ref{sec:ADMPert}.} Then we have
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{ \langle \zeta_p\rangle^2=\frac{H^4}{\dot\phi^2}\frac{1}{2p(p+1)(p+2)}=\frac{H^4}{2M_{Pl}^2 (\dot H-\frac{1}{a^2})}\frac{1}{2p(p+1)(p+2)}}
 \label{eq:2point_function2}
\end{equation}
which for large $p$ leads to the flat space power spectrum (which scales as $H^2/(\epsilon  k^{3})$).

Both, the wave function in Eq.~\eqref{eq:wavefunction_latetime} and the two point function generalise the results obtained for a flat universe in~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr}.
In general to compute the correlation functions we use the relation
 \begin{equation}
 \langle \chi\vert \mathcal{O}[\varphi,\pi]\vert\chi\rangle=\int\mathcal{D}\varphi\ \chi^*[\varphi]\mathcal{O}\left[\varphi,-i\frac{\delta}{\delta\varphi}\right]\chi[\varphi]\label{eq:pathintegral}
\end{equation}
where we are assuming that the wavefunciton $\chi$ is implicitly normalised by a factor $\sqrt {N}$. Using this relation we find
\begin{align}
\langle\varphi_{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m}\rangle&=N\int\mathcal{D}\varphi |\varphi_{p, l, m}|^2e^{i {(S-S^*)}}\nonumber\\
&=N\int\mathcal{D}\varphi |\varphi_{p, l, m}|^2 e^{\sum_{p, l, m}-2\mathrm{Im}{c_p}|\varphi_{p, l, m}|^2}=\frac{1}{2\mathrm{Im}{c_p}} \,.
\end{align}
Note that this does not depend on $l, m$ so we can write
 \begin{align}
 \langle\varphi_p\varphi_{p}\rangle'=\frac{1}{2\text{Im}\  c_p}=H^2\frac{(1+p)^2\cos^2\eta+\sin^2\eta}{2p(p+1)(p+2)} \,,
 \label{eq:2pointfunction}
 \end{align}
 which implies that at $\eta=\pi/2$ becomes, $\langle\varphi_p^2\rangle\sim 1/(p(p+1)(p+2))$ as we saw before. The scale dependence at large scales can have an effect on the large angular distances of the CMB, which will be similar to the one described in~\cite{Cespedes:2020xpn}. This will depend on the duration of inflation as well as  whether there are higher derivative interactions that change the two point function. We will discuss a modified speed of sound effect in Sec.~\ref{sec:EFT}.

Generalising Eq.~\eqref{eq:chi} to include terms beyond the quadratic order, we can write $\chi=\exp\left(i\Gamma\right)$ and 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Gamma}
\Gamma=\sum_{p, l,m} c_p(\tau)\varphi_{p, l, m}\varphi_{p, l, -m}+\frac{1}{6} \sum_{p_i, l_i, m_i}G_{123} c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}\varphi_{p_1, l_1, m_1} \varphi_{p_2, l_2, m_2} \varphi_{p_3, l_3, m_3}+... \,,
\end{equation}
where $G_{123} =\int d\Omega \, Y_{p_1, l_1, m_1} Y_{p_2, l_2, m_2}Y_{p_3, l_3, m_3}$ (this can be expressed in terms of 3j symbols).

One can compute higher order correlation functions following the same procedure that we used for the power spectrum. The three-point function and four-point function coefficients are given by

 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:3PointCF}
 &\langle\varphi_{p_1, l_1, m_1}\varphi_{p_2, l_2, m_2}\varphi_{p_3, l_3, m_3}\rangle'=\frac{2\text{Im}c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}}{\prod_i 2 \text{Im} c_{p_i}} \,,
 \end{align}
 \begin{footnotesize}
 \begin{align}
  \label{eq:4PointCF}
  &\langle\varphi_{p_1, l_1, m_1}\varphi_{p_2, l_2, m_2}\varphi_{p_3, l_3, m_3}\varphi_{p_4, l_4, m_4}\rangle'=\frac{1}{8}\left(\prod_{i=1}^{4}\frac{1}{\text{Im} c_{p_i}}\right)\left( \text{Im}c^{(4)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4}-\sum_{j=i}^{4}\frac{\text{Im}c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_j}\text{Im}c^{(3)}_{p_3,p_4,p_j}}{\text{Im}c_{p_j}}-\mathrm{perms.}\right) \,, \nonumber
 \end{align}
 \end{footnotesize}
where the prime denotes geometric factors.\\

Note that in order for the wave-function to be normalisable all the higher-order interactions should be regarded as small corrections to the Gaussian wave-function.

\subsection{Interactions}

Adding interactions is straightforward in the Schr\"odinger picture (see for example ~\cite{Cespedes:2020xqq} for a recent implementation in the case of a flat universe). In order to compute the higher order coefficients it is better to write the Hamiltonian as
 \begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}[\varphi, \pi] =\mathcal{ H}_{\rm{free}}[\varphi, \pi] + \mathcal{H}_{\rm{int}}[\varphi, \pi] \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}_{\rm{free}}$ is the free Hamiltonian from Eq.~\eqref{eq:calH}. From now on we will drop the $l$ and $m$ indices from the scalar field.

Let us start assuming that we have a cubic interaction $H_{\rm{int}}=a^3 \lambda \varphi^3$. Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:Schrodinger} with $\Gamma$ given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Gamma} and taking  functional derivatives we get up to third order in the fields~\cite{Cespedes:2020xqq}
\begin{equation}
\left(-\partial_\eta+3 a^{-2}\sum_{i=1}^3c_{p_i}(\tau) \right)c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=a \frac{\delta^3 \mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}}{\delta\varphi_{p_1}\delta\varphi_{p_2}\delta\varphi_{p_3}} \,,\label{eq:3HJ}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}$ is also re-written in term of spherical harmonics such that the coefficient $G_{123}$ factors out from the equation.
It is best to transform into the interaction picture performing an unitary transformation at each time to define a new operator, $\phi_p^I=\phi_p/f_p$. This corresponds to rescaling  the wave-function coefficients,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:InteractionPictureCoefficients}
c^I_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=f_{p_1}f_{p_2}f_{p_3}c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3} \,.
\end{equation}
The interaction picture Hamiltonian is defined as $\mathcal{H}^{I}_{\rm{int}}[\phi^I]=\mathcal{H}_{\rm{int}}[f_p\phi_l^p]$. This greatly simplifies the equations, for example for a cubic interaction as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:3HJ} it becomes,
\begin{equation}
-\partial_\eta c^I_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=a\frac{\delta^3H_\mathrm{int}^I}{\delta\varphi_{p_1}^I\delta\varphi_{p_2}^I\delta\varphi_{p_3}^I}=a^4 \lambda  f_{p_1}f_{p_2}f_{p_3} \,,
\label{eq:cubicHJ}
\end{equation}
where we have used that $c_p=-a^2\partial_\eta f_p/f_p$. The resulting expression is simpler to integrate. Indeed we have that the interaction coefficient is given by

\begin{align} c^I_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&=\lambda \int_{-\infty}^\eta  d\eta'\  a^4 f_{p_1}f_{p_2}f_{p_3}\\
 &=\frac{\lambda}{H^4}\int_{-\infty}^{\eta} d\eta' \sec{\eta'}^4\prod_{i=1}^3 \frac{((1+p_i)\cos\ \eta'+i\sin\ \eta' )e^{-i(p_i+1)\eta'}}{\sqrt{2p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}} \,.
\end{align}
Note that  $\eta<0$ corresponds to the Euclidean region  which we get by tha continuation $\eta\to i T$. In this region the mode functions are given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunctionEuclid} and the scale factor by Eq.~ \eqref{eq:EuclideanScaleFactor}. In the end, since the mode function has a factor of $\exp(i(p(p+1)T))$, the integrand goes to zero  in the limit $T\to\infty$. This is similar to the contour rotation done in the in-in computations on a flat universe~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr}, where the integrals vanish at $a=0$. 
After performing the integral we find,
\begin{align}
c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&=\frac{\lambda}{H^4}\prod_{p=1}^3\frac{1}{(p_i+1)\cos\eta+i\sin\eta}\nonumber\\
  & \left(-\frac{i\sec (\eta )}{3} \sum_{\mathrm{perm}}^3\left(\frac{\sec^2\eta}{3}-i (p_1+1)\tan\eta+p_1^2-p_1 p_2-1\right)\right. \nonumber\\
   &\left.+\frac{2 i e^{i \eta }\sum_i p_i (p_i+1)
   (p_i+2)}{3 (p_T+2) } \, _2F_1\left(1,\frac{1}{2}
   (-p_T-2);\frac{1}{2} (-p_T);-e^{2
   i \eta }\right)\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $p_T = p_1 + p_2 + p_3$. Note that the piece that contains the hypergeometric function diverges at $\eta=\pi/2$, so this expression needs to be regularised before taking the limit. To see this let us expand around $\eta_0$ with $\pi/2-\eta_0\ll1$. We get
\begin{align}
c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&=\frac{\lambda}{H^4}\left(\frac{1}{9} \left(\frac{24}{(\pi -2 \eta_0 )^3}+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 (9 p_i (p_i+2)+4)}{\pi -2 \eta_0 }\right)\right.\nonumber\\
&+\left.\frac{i}{9} (p_T+3) \left(6 p_T+2+\sum_{\rm{perm}} p_1(4 p_1-(p_2+p_3))\right)\right.\nonumber\\
&\left. - \frac{i}{3} \, \sum_i p_i (p_i+1)
   (p_i+2)\left(\gamma_E+\frac{1}{3}+i\pi/2+\log(\pi-2\eta_0)+\psi ^{(0)}\left(-\frac{p_T}{2}-1\right)\right)\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $\psi^0$ is the digamma function, $\gamma_E$ the Euler-Mascheroni constant and   we have been careful in first taking the limit in $c_{p_1,p_2,p_3}^I$ and then divide by the mode functions evaluated at $\eta=\pi/2$. Notice that  $\eta_0$ acts as a cutoff up to where the correlation function is valid.
The fact that there are IR divergencies in de Sitter correlation functions is a known fact~\cite{Weinberg:2006ac,Burgess:2009bs,Seery:2010kh,Burgess:2010dd,Giddings:2011ze,Anninos:2014lwa, Cespedes:2020xqq}. It has been studied extensively for a flat universe in the past so it is not surprising that it also appears on closed universes.  

Now let us compute the correlation function close to the conformal boundary. First notice that the first two pieces are real so they don't contribute to the correlation function. Indeed we have,
\begin{align}
\langle\varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle'&=\frac{2\lambda}{H^4}\prod\frac{1}{2p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\left( \frac{2(p_T+3)}{9} \left(6p_T+2+\sum_{\rm{perm}}p_1(4p_1-(p_2+p_3))\right)\right.\nonumber\\
&\left.+\frac{2}{3} \,\sum_i p_i (p_i+1)
   (p_i+2)\left(\gamma_E+\log(\pi-2\eta_0)+\psi ^{(0)}\left(-\frac{p_T}{2}-1\right)\right)\right) \,,
&
\label{eq:coeffphi3}
\end{align} 
which is similar to the expression computed for a flat universe~\cite{Creminelli:2011mw},
\begin{align}
\langle\varphi_{k_1}\varphi_{k_2}\varphi_{k_3}\rangle'&\propto \frac{1}{\prod_i k_i^3}\left(\sum_ik_i^3(-1+\gamma_E+\log(-k_T\eta_*))+k_1k_2k_3-\sum_{i\neq j}k_i^2k_j\right) \,,
\end{align}
where now  $\eta_*$ is evaluated in the Poincaré patch coordinates and so is close to zero. Furthermore notice that for large $p_T$ one has that  $\psi_0(-1-p_T)\sim\log (-p_T)$. This suggests that both  expressions coincide for large $l$ which can be shown explicitly by assuming that $p_1,p_2,p_3\gg 1$.

\subsection{Non-Gaussianities in a flat universe}

%\section{Primordial non Gaussianity}
We will be interested in computing correlation functions  of the curvature perturbation $\zeta$. In this section we will collect some useful results in flat space. First, the two and three point functions are usually written as,
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta(\k_1)\zeta(\k_2)\rangle&=(2\pi)^3\delta(\k_1+\k_2)P(k_1) \,, \label{eq:PowerSpectrumFlat}\\
\langle\zeta(\k_1)\zeta(\k_2)\zeta(\k_3)\rangle&=(2\pi)^3\delta\left(\sum \k_i\right)B(k_1,k_2,k_3) \label{eq:BispectrumFlat}\,,
\end{align}
where $P(k)$ is the power spectrum and  $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$ the bispectrum. The power spectrum is also written in terms of the scale invariant power spectrum through
\begin{align}
\Delta_\zeta^2=\frac{k^3}{2\pi^2}P(k) \,.
\end{align}
The value of $\Delta_\zeta$ can be obtained from  CMB observations  and is  $\Delta_\zeta^2= 2.09\times 10^{-9}$~\cite{Planck:2018jri}.
Non-Gaussianity is usually parametrised in terms of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ defined as,
\begin{align}
B(k_1,k_2,k_3)=\frac{18}{5}\frac{f_{\mathrm{NL}}(k_1,k_2,k_3)}{(k_1 k_2 k_3)^2}\Delta_\zeta^4 \,.
\end{align}
Bounds on $f_\mathrm{{NL}}$ depends on  the relative size of the wavenumbers. Since  they form a triangle, $f_\mathrm{{NL}}$  is usually constrained depending on the shapes they form. For instance, when all three $k$ are equal, the shape is called equilateral. Non-Gaussianity is also constrained from CMB observations, for instance the equilateral shape is bounded to be  $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{equil}}=-26\pm 47$ whereas for the orthogonal shape $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{ortho}}=-38\pm 24$~\cite{Planck:2019kim}. Notice that since the bispectrum is proportional to $\Delta_\zeta^4$ non-Gaussianity is extremely suppressed. 


\subsection{Non-Gaussianities in a closed universe}


After understanding how to compute higher order correlation functions, let us now obtain the bispectrum due to primordial non-Gaussianities. In flat gauge the action at cubic order is given\footnote{To the authors' knowledge this action was obtained first in~\cite{Clunan:2009ib}. There is an effective mass term there i.e. $\partial^2\rightarrow \partial^2+3$ which we ignore since in the regime of interest $3\ll p(p+2)$.} by,
\begin{align}
S_3=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\int dt d^3 x \sqrt{\gamma} \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\varphi^3+a^5\sqrt{2\epsilon} H\dot\varphi^2 \partial^{-2}\dot\varphi +\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}_2}{\delta\varphi}f(\varphi)\right) \,,
\label{eq:cubic_action}
\end{align}
with $\epsilon = -\frac{\dot\phi^2}{2H^2}$ and where $f(\varphi)$ is  given by,
\begin{align}
f(\varphi)= \frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{8}\varphi^2-\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{4}\partial^{-2}(\varphi\partial^{2}\varphi)-\frac{3\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{8}(\partial^{-2})\varphi^2 \,.
\label{eq:def_fieldrd}
\end{align}
The terms proportional to the equations of motion can be removed by a field redefinition, 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FieldRedefinition}
\varphi=\varphi_c+f(\varphi_c) \,.
\end{align}
In term of $\varphi_c$ the action becomes,
\begin{align}
S_3=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\int d^4x \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\varphi_c^3+a^5\sqrt{2\epsilon} H\dot\varphi_c^2(\delta)^{-2}\dot\varphi_c \right) \,.
\end{align}
The first term only appears when there is curvature. Its appearance comes from the fact that $V'''$ has a factor of $a^{-2}$ due to the curvature term in the Friedmann equation,
\begin{equation}
V'''(\phi)=\frac{6H}{a^2\dot{\phi}}+O(\sqrt{\epsilon}) \,. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Moreover, notice that this term is not slow-roll suppressed and it appears only on a closed (or open) universe and it dilutes with the expansion of the universe. 
Including all the terms the Hamiltonian is given by,
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}_{\rm{int}}=-\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\int  d^3 x\left(\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\varphi_c^3+\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon}H}{a^3}\pi_\varphi^2\partial^{-2}\pi_\varphi\right) \,.
\label{eq:IntHamPNG}
\end{align}
Expanding the fields into spherical harmonics, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is the following\footnote{We write explicitly the expressions in the Lorentzian region, using the conformal time $\eta$. Analogous expressions can be found in the Euclidean regions, using conformal Euclidean time $T$.},
\begin{align}
\left(\partial_\eta-\frac{1}{a^2}\sum_i c_{p_i}\right)c^{(3)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}+\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon}H}{a^3}\sum _{\rm{perm}}c_{p_1}c_{p_2}\partial^{-2}c_{p_3} \,.
\end{align}
Since we will only compute the cubic coeffcient $c^{(3)}$ from now on we will remove the superindex on the coefficient and we will only keep the subindices.
Written in terms of the interaction picture this equation simplifies to,
\begin{align}
\partial_{\eta}c^I_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}\prod_{i}f_{p_i}+\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon} H}{a^3}\prod_{i}f_{p_i}\sum _{\rm{perm}}c_{p_1}c_{p_2}\partial^{-2}c_{p_3} \,,
\label{eq:IntegraPNG}
\end{align}
where the expressions for the functions $f_p$ and $c_p$ are given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunction} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:clL} respectively. In Eq.~\eqref{eq:IntegraPNG}, the second term is the standard contribution that also appears in the spatially flat Universe case. The second term however, is specific to a spatially closed geometry.\\

We can compute third order coefficient applying the  the machinery developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Formalism}. We will call the first term in  Eq.~\eqref{eq:IntegraPNG} $c^{a}$, whereas the second term will be denoted $c^{b}$: the result of this will have to match with the flat case result in an appropriate limit that will be discussed below. Replacing the Laplacian operator by its eigenvalue $-p(p+2)$, the third order coefficient is given by,
\begin{align}
c^{(b)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&=\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_*} H_*}{\prod_{i}f_{p_i}}\int_{-\infty}^{\pi/2} d\eta \, a^{-3}\prod_{i}f_{p_i}\sum_{\rm{perm}}c_{p_1}c_{p_2}\frac{1}{-p_3(p_3+2)}c_{p_3}\,,\nonumber
\end{align}
where, in computing the integral, in the $-\infty < T < 0$ region we have used the Euclidean expressions for $a$, $f_p$, $c_p$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:EuclideanScaleFactor}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunctionEuclid} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:clE}), while we have used Lorentzian expressions (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:LorentzianScaleFactor}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunction} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:clL}) in the region $0 < \eta < \pi/2$. Note that the contribution to the integral from the Euclidean region vanishes, hence evaluating the result at $\eta = \pi/2$ we are left with,
\begin{equation}
c^{(b)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3} = i\frac{1}{M_{Pl}}\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_*}}{H_*^2} \,  \times \frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i(p_i+2)p_j(p_j+2)}{p_T+3} \,,
\end{equation}
where the asterisk denote the value at horizon crossing. This is equivalent to the flat space case, where the contour is rotated in the past, $\eta\to-(1+i\epsilon)\infty$ to select the interacting vacuum. Notice that the cubic coefficient has an overall $i$, which implies that there it is a small contribution in the wave function since it appears schematically as $\chi\sim\exp(- l^3 \varphi^3)$. Finally, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:3PointCF}, the three point function is given by 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\langle\varphi_{c, p_1}\varphi_{c, p_2}\varphi_{c, p_3}\rangle'=\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_*}}{4}\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}}\prod_{i}\frac{1}{p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\times\frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i(p_i+1)p_j(p_j+1)}{p_T+3}} \,.
\end{equation}
where the $'$ denotes that we have to multiply the right hand side by $G_{123}$.
At this point we can compute the coefficients from the field redefinition in Eq.~\eqref{eq:FieldRedefinition}. In order to do so, we need to use Wick's theorem: for instance the first term in the field redefinition gives the following contribution to the three point function,
\begin{align}
\langle \varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)\varphi(x_3)\rangle=\langle \varphi_c(x_1)\varphi_c(x_2)\varphi_c(x_3)\rangle+\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{4}\left(\langle\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)\rangle\langle\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_3)\rangle+\mathrm{perm.}\right) \,.
\end{align}
The first two terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_fieldrd} also appear on a flat universe. For a closed universe their contribution is~\cite{Clunan:2009ib},
\begin{align}
\label{eq:3pfFR12}
\langle  \varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle_{\rm{fr}}'=\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_*}}{32}\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}}\prod_{i}\frac{1}{p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\times\left(\sum_i p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)+\sum_{i\neq j}(p_i+1)p_j(p_j+2)\right)
\end{align}
where  the subscript denotes that are terms from the field redefinition.
Finally, the last term from the field redefinition gives,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:3pfFR13}
\langle \varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle_{\rm{fr}}'=\frac{3\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{32}\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}}\prod_{i}\frac{p_T+3}{p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)} \,.
\end{align}
Summing all the terms, the three point function is given by,
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
\langle \varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle'&=\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}}\frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_*}}{32\prod_{i}p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\\
&\times\left(\sum_i p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)+\sum_{i\neq j}(p_i+1)p_j(p_j+2)+8\frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i(p_i+2)p_j(p_j+2)}{p_T+3}+3(p_T+3)\right) \,. \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{small}
In order to compare with observations we  need to change to  $\zeta$ gauge. The relation between the two gauges simplifies after horizon crossing and it can be written using~\cite{Sasaki:1995aw},
\begin{align}
\zeta (t,\x)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(\frac{\partial ^nN(t,t^*)}{\partial\phi_*^n}\right)(\varphi_*(t_*,x))^n \,,
\end{align}
where $t$ is some time after horizon crossing $t^*$,  and  $N$ is the number of efolds between the spatial slices labelled by $t_*$ and $t$. Note that this formula is written in real space and the transformation to spherical harmonics  has to be treated carefully \cite{Clunan:2009ib}.  In the end this means that there  are extra terms in the  bispectrum of $\zeta$. Indeed we have,
\begin{align}
\langle \zeta_{p_1}\zeta_{p_2}\zeta_{p_3}\rangle'=\left(\frac{\delta N}{\delta\phi_*}\right)^3\langle\varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\delta N}{\delta\phi_*}\right)^2 \frac{\delta^2 N}{\delta \phi_*^2}\left(\sum_{\rm{perm}}\langle \varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_1}\rangle\langle \varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_2}\rangle\right) \,.
\label{eq:3pfZetaCoV}
\end{align}
Given that $\delta N=H dt$ we finally have  that,
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta N}{\delta \phi_*}=-\frac{H_*}{\dot\phi_*} \,,\qquad \frac{\delta^2 N}{\delta\phi_*^2}=\frac{H_*\ddot \phi_*}{\dot\phi^3_*}+\frac{1}{2M_{Pl}^2}-\frac{1}{\dot\phi_*^2 a^2} \,,
\end{align} with all of this we finally have,
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:closedBispectrum2V}
\langle \zeta_{p_1}\zeta_{p_2}\zeta_{p_3}\rangle'&=\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}^4}\frac{1}{2\epsilon_*\times 32}\frac{1}{\prod_{i}p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\\
&\times\left(\sum_i p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)+\sum_{i\neq j}(p_i+1)p_j(p_j+2)+8\frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i(p_i+2)p_j(p_j+2)}{p_T+3}+3(p_T+3)\right) \nonumber\\
&+\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}^4}\frac{1}{4\epsilon}\left(\frac{1}{2\epsilon}\left(\frac{\ddot \phi_*}{\dot\phi_*H_*}+\frac{1}{a_*^2 H_*^2}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{1}{\prod_i 2p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)}\sum_i p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2) \,,\nonumber
\end{align}
\end{small}
where in the last line we have used Eq.~\eqref{eq:2point_function}. 
This result is a generalization of Maldacena's computation~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr}, 
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta_{\k_1}\zeta_{\k_2}\zeta_{\k_3}\rangle'=\frac{H^4_*}{M_{Pl}^4}\frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\frac{1}{\prod_i 2k_i^3}\left[\epsilon\left(\sum_i k_i^3+\sum_{i\neq j}k_ik_j^2+\frac{8}{k_T}\sum_{i>j}k_i^2 k_j^2\right)+\frac{2\ddot\phi_*}{\dot\phi_* H_*}\sum_i k_i^3\right] \,,
\label{eq:PNG_flatU}
\end{align}
where a prime here means that we are taking out a factor of $(2\pi)^3\delta(\sum_i k_i)$. Our result for a closed Universe agrees with the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PNG_flatU} for a flat Universe in the limit of large $p$. 

However, as we will see below, the most important difference between the flat Universe and the closed Universe cases is determined by the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:IntegraPNG}, that we have neglected so far. In fact, it gives,
\begin{align}
c^{(a)}_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilonM_{Pl}} \prod_i f_{p_i}}\int^{\pi/2}_{-\infty} d\eta \, a^2\prod_i f_{p_i}\label{eq:ca}\\
&\simeq-\frac{i}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}M_{Pl} H^2}\left(-(p_T+1)+\frac{p_1p_2 p_3}{(p_T+2)(p_T+4)} + \frac{\sum_{i>j} p_i p_j}{(p_T+2)}\right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon} H^2}\frac{1}{\eta-\pi/2} \,, \nonumber
\end{align}
where in the last equation we have expanded in powers of $\eta-\pi/2$. As before, in the Euclidean region $(-\infty, 0)$ we have used Eq.~\eqref{eq:EuclideanScaleFactor}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:modefunctionEuclid} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:clE}, and the contribution to the integral from this region vanishes.
Note that there is no logarithmic divergence in this case, and moreover that the infrared divergence does not appear in the correlation function because the term proportional to $(\eta - \pi/2)^{-1}$ is real. The difference with Eq.~\eqref{eq:coeffphi3} arises because the $\varphi^3$ term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:IntHamPNG} has an extra $a^2$ which appears after integrating by parts the slow-roll coefficients. This changes the degree of the divergence in such a way that the correlation function is now finite. 
Finally, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:3PointCF}, we have that the contribution to the bispectrum by the new terms is given by, 
\begin{align}
\langle \varphi_{p_1}\varphi_{p_2}\varphi_{p_3}\rangle'=\frac{H_*^4}{4\sqrt{2\epsilon_*}M_{Pl}}\frac{1}{\prod_{i}p_i(p_i+2)(p_i+2)}\left(-(p_T+1)+\frac{p_1p_2p_3}{(p_T+2)(p_T+4)}+\frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i p_j}{(p_T+2)}\right) \,.
\label{PNG}
\end{align}
Writing this expression in the comoving gauge we find, 
\begin{align}
\langle \zeta_{p_1}\zeta_{p_2}\zeta_{p_3}\rangle'=\frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}^2}\frac{1}{4(2\epsilon)^2}\frac{1}{\prod_{i}p_i(p_i+2)(p_i+2)}\left(-(p_T+1)+\frac{p_1 p_2 p_3}{(p_T+2)(p_T+4)}+\frac{\sum_{i>j}p_i p_j}{(p_T+2)}\right) +\dots\,.
\label{eq:zeta3prime}
\end{align}
where the dots are terms that depend on the second piece of Eq.~\eqref{eq:3pfZetaCoV} which are already included in Eq.~ \eqref{eq:closedBispectrum2V}.
Notice that the bispectrum  we have  computed is $1/\epsilon$ larger than the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:closedBispectrum2V}. In any case for small scales this contribution vanishes since it  scales as $p^{-8}$ whereas the terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:closedBispectrum2V} scale as $p^{-6}$. Please note that our expressions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:closedBispectrum2V} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:zeta3prime} are valid for any $p$ and they agree with~\cite{Seery:2010kh} at very large $p$.

Before continuing let us comment on the soft theorems in the presence of  curvature. First let us notice  that when one of the modes is much larger than the others $k_3\ll k_1,k_2$, it means that it exits the horizon earlier. Its overall effect over shorter modes is to make them cross the horizon earlier by $\delta t\sim -\zeta/H$. For a flat universe this lead to a consistency condition~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr,Creminelli:2004yq} which is related to the existence of a soft mode. When there is curvature this consistency condition is broken, as it has been pointed out in~\cite{Avis:2019eav}, due to the fact that the curvature breaks the cosmological soft theorems.


\subsection{Computing $f_\mathrm{{NL}}$}

As mentioned before, the bispectrum for a flat universe is usually written as~\cite{Baumann:2014nda},
\begin{align}
B_\zeta(k_1,k_2,k_3)=\frac{18}{5}\frac{f_{\mathrm{NL}}(k_1,k_2,k_3)}{(k_1k_2k_3)^2}\Delta_\zeta^4 \,, \label{eq:flatFnl}
\end{align}
where $f_\mathrm{{NL}}$  depends on the three momenta\footnote{Notice that the definition used in~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr,Clunan:2009ib} is \begin{align}
B_\zeta(k_1,k_2,k_3)=\frac{12}{5}f_{\mathrm{NL}}\frac{\sum k_i^3}{\prod 2 k_i^3}\Delta_\zeta^4 \,.
\end{align} } and $\Delta_\zeta^2=k^3/2\pi^2 \langle\zeta_\k^2\rangle$. This definition removes the overall scale dependence and so $f_\mathrm{{NL}}$ depends only on the ratios between the three comoving momenta. Usually the ratios are then fixed by considering  different shapes, for instance when the momenta form an equilateral triangle. 

In order to generalise this parametrisation let us first note that the definition of $\Delta_\zeta^2$ contains a geometric factor that  does not appear on a closed universe. Instead, let us use the definition
\begin{align}
\tilde{\Delta}_\zeta^2\equiv \frac{H_*^4}{M_{Pl}^2}\frac{1}{4\epsilon}
\end{align}
such that $\tilde{\Delta}_\zeta^2=p(p+1)(p+2)\langle\zeta_p^2\rangle$.
Next, let us notice that there is a factor of $(2\pi)^3\delta(\sum \vec{k_i})$ from the definition of the bispectrum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:BispectrumFlat}. This corresponds to a geometric factor, and for a closed universe it is possible to see from 
\eqref{eq:relation_delta_G}, that it matches the sum of $3js$ functions for large $l$ and small $r$. We can define the bispectrum on a flat universe as,
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta_{p_1}\zeta_{p_2}\zeta_{p_3}\rangle'=B_\zeta(p_1,p_2,p_3)
\end{align} then in analogy with the flat case  we can define  the Non Gaussian parameter $\tilde f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ through the relation,
\begin{align}
B_{\zeta}(p_1,p_2,p_3)=\frac{18}{5}\frac{\tilde f_{\mathrm{NL}}(p_1,p_2,p_3)}{\left(\prod_i p_i(p_i+1)(p_i+2)\right)^{2/3}}\tilde\Delta_\zeta^4 \,, \label{eq:closedFnl}
\end{align}
which reduces to Eq.~\eqref{eq:flatFnl} for large $p$ up to a geometric proportionality constant.
Notice that, since the bispectrum is not scale invariant $\tilde f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ will also depend on the sizes of $p$, not only on their ratios. Nevertheless, as we show in Sec.~\ref{sec:Harmonics}, in the limit when $p\gg 1$ the modes are well approximated by their flat universe counterpart. In this case  $\tilde f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ reduces to the flat space  $f_{\rm NL}$. 

In this sense $\tilde f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ incorporates the scale dependent effects that are relevant at small $p$. From the bispectrum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:closedBispectrum2V} we can see that the scale dependent  contribution scales as $\epsilon^2 p^{-2}$, which is the reason the bispectrum is suppressed at small scales. On the other hand the contribution from Eq.~\eqref{PNG} is not slow-roll suppressed and hence it becomes the dominant term at small $p$.
 
In order to estimate the size of non Gaussianites let us compute the bispectrum in the equilateral limit when all $p's$ have  the same size. We can write the result schematically as, 
 \begin{align}
\boxed{
 \tilde{f}_{\mathrm{NL}}=f_{\mathrm{NL}} - \frac{5}{12} \frac{1}{a^2 H^2} +\frac{85}{162}\frac{1}{p^2}}
 \end{align}
where $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim\mathcal{O}(\epsilon,\eta)$ is the usual non-Gaussianity computed on a flat universe. Corrections from the curvature to those terms will be typically of order $\sim\mathcal{O}(\epsilon,\eta)(1-p^{-2}+\mathcal{O}(p^{-3}))$ and so very small. At large scales there is a larger contribution from the term proportional to $3(p_T+3)$ which scales as $p^{-2}$ but it is slow-roll suppressed. More interesting are the other terms. The second one corresponds to the remnant curvature and it is bounded by Planck to be very suppressed. The last term corresponds the the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:IntHamPNG}, which as we discussed appears because the third derivative of the potential has a leading order piece that depends on the curvature. Depending on the size of the slow-roll parameters, the last term can be the dominant one by several orders of magnitude. This illustrates the fact that curvature effects may eventually have observational implications.

Let us comment on which modes are observable. We can estimate that the largest CMB scale  given the comoving distance to the CMB dipole is around at $\chi_L=.46$. This corresponds to an angular fraction of $p\sim\pi/.46\sim 7$ ~\cite{Seery:2010kh}. Hence the smallest $p$ observed in the sky is $p\sim 7$, by which the largest contribution to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is at most of order $.01$. Nevertheless, notice that assuming only Planck data a closed universe is preferred with $\Omega_k\sim -0.056\pm 0.01$~\cite{Planck:2018jri,Handley:2019tkm}, such a value will imply a larger set of available modes and hence the maximum value of  $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ increases by an order of magnitude.
\subsection{Effective field theory of inflation}
\label{sec:EFT}
With our formalism it is also possible to include other interactions that appear, for example,  when including higher derivative interactions such as in $P(X)$ theories. In order to do so it is better to use the  the EFT of inflation \cite{Cheung:2007st,Creminelli:2013cga}. The idea is to consider the most general action with broken time diffeomorphisms expanded around an FLRW background,
\begin{align}
S=\int &d^4 x \sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{1}{2}M_{Pl}^2R+M_{Pl}^2\left(\dot H-\frac{k}{a^2}\right)\cdot g^{00}-M_{Pl}^2\left(3H^2+\dot H+2\frac{k^2}{a^2}\right)\right.\nonumber\\
&\left.+\frac{1}{2!}M(t)(g^{00}+1)^2+\frac{1}{3!}c_3(t)M(t)^4(g^{00}+1)^3+...\right] \,.
\end{align}
The Goldstone boson $\pi$ associated to broken time translations is introduced through the St\"uckelberg trick, $t\to t+\pi$. Up to cubic order, and  neglecting the mixing with the graviton, this leads to the following action
\begin{align}
S=\int d^4 x\sqrt{-g} \, \frac{\epsilon H^2M_{Pl}^2}{c_s^2}\left[\left(\dot\pi^2-c_s^2\frac{(\nabla\pi^2)}{a^2}\right)+\alpha\dot\pi\frac{(\nabla\pi)^2}{a^2}+\beta\dot\pi^3\right] \,,
\label{eq:EFTOI}
\end{align}
where $g$ is the minisuperspace metric determinant and the speed of sound $c_s$ is defined as,
\begin{align}
c_s^{-2}=1-\frac{2M^4}{M_{Pl}^2(\dot H-ka^{-2})} \,,
\label{eq:cs}
\end{align}
and,
\begin{align}
\alpha=c_s^2-1\,,\qquad \beta=(1-c_s^2)\left(1+\frac{2}{3}\frac{c_3}{c_s^2}\right) \,.
\end{align}
There is an extra term in the quadratic action proportional to $\dot H\pi^2$ which we have ignored since it is subleading order in slow roll. Notice however, that this term  will induce an additional  curvature term  which will act as an effective mass term. As before, we will ignore it since in the regime of interest $3\ll p(p+2)$.
 At cubic order the action will contain in Eq.~\eqref{eq:EFTOI} contain an additional  curvature term, similar to that described in Eq.~\eqref{eq:cubic_action}, since it is not slow-roll suppressed. Its effect will be similar to the one described in the previous section. Even though the parameters of the action look identical to the ones on the flat universe case they are not the same. The difference is due to the fact that they are obtained after expanding around different backgrounds, as  has been pointed out in~\cite{Creminelli:2013cga}. When comparing to the flat universe EFT, it can be shown that the parameters for a closed universe  can depend on higher order coefficients. Notice the explicit dependence on $k$ on Eq.~\eqref{eq:cs}.

In order to compute observables we need to relate the  Goldstone mode to the curvature perturbation. This is done by a  gauge transformation, from unitary gauge to comoving gauge, which on super-horizon scales becomes $\zeta=-H\pi$. Finally, since the action is decoupled from gravity it is possible to  formulate it the problem in terms of a Schr\"odinger equation by assuming that it corresponds to a scalar field $\pi$ coupled to a fixed gravitational background. This is very similar to the action of the perturbations we obtained through the Born-Oppenheimer procedure, although in this case we will not specify the minisuperspace action. 

In order to write the Hamiltonian it is convenient to define the gravitational coupling scale $f_\pi^4\equiv 2M_{Pl}^2 \vert\dot H-1/a^2\vert c_s^{-2}$  . In terms of this the  conjugate momenta is,
\begin{align}
P_\pi\equiv \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\dot\pi}=\sqrt{-g} f_\pi^4\dot\pi \left(1+\alpha \frac{(\nabla \pi)^2}{a^2}+3\beta\dot\pi\right) \,.
\end{align} 
Then the Hamiltonian density is,
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{1}{2f_\pi^4}P_\pi^2+\sqrt{-g}\frac{f_\pi^4c_s^2}{2a^2 }\nabla\pi^2-\frac{\alpha}{2a^2}P_\pi(\nabla\pi)^2+\frac{1}{g}\frac{\beta}{2f_\pi^8}P_\pi^3 \,.
\end{align}
Let us first solve the free part of the Schr\"odinger equation. Expanding the fields in spherical harmonics we have that 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}_0=\sum_{p, l, m}\frac{1}{2f_\pi^4}\frac{P_\pi}{a^3}+c_s^2a p(p+2)\pi_{p, l, m}^2 \,.
\end{align}
In order to solve the Schr\"odinger equation, again we assume a Gaussian wave-function
\begin{equation}
\chi=\exp(i\sum_{p, l, m} c_p(\eta)\pi_{p, l, m} \pi_{p, l, -m}) \,,
\end{equation}
and we make the replacement
$P_\pi\to i\frac{\delta}{\delta_\pi}$. Doing so we obtain the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_p}{\partial\eta}=\frac{1}{a^2f_\pi^4} c_p^2+c_s^2a^2 p (p+2) \,,
\end{align}
which can be  solved by assuming a Bunch-Davies vacuum. We find that the solution is,
\begin{align}
c_p= \frac{f_\pi^4 c_s^2}{H^2} \frac{ p(p+2)\sec\eta}{i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p(p+2)}\cos\eta - \sin\eta} \,.
\label{eq:cl_EFT}
\end{align}
We are interested in the two point function of $\zeta$ at $t\to\pi/2$ which is  
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta^2\rangle&=H^2\langle\pi^2\rangle=\frac{H^4}{2c_s^2 f_\pi^4}\frac{1}{p(p+2)\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p (p+2)}}\nonumber\\
&=
\frac{H^4}{4 M_{Pl}^2(\dot H-1/a^2)}\frac{1}{p(p+2)\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p(p+2)}} \,.
\end{align}
This result generalises Eq.~\eqref{eq:2point_function2} to the case with a modified speed of sound. In order to compare with a flat universe we have that for large $p$ the power spectrum is given by,
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta^2\rangle= \frac{H^4}{4M_{Pl}^2(\dot H-1/a^2)c_s}\frac{1}{p^3}\left(1-\frac{3}{p}+\frac{15 c_s^2-1}{2c_s^2}\frac{1}{p^2}+\mathcal{O}\left(p^{-3}\right)\right) \,.
\end{align}  notice that in for large $p$ we recover the usual  enhancement of  a factor of $c_s^{-1}$. We can also see that there is a further enhancement which appears  for low $p$ modes. Notice that in the case of small $c_s$ the second term can be of order $c_s^{-1}$ changing the large scale power spectrum. This behaviour  has been highlighted before~\cite{Avis:2019eav} but using an approximated version of the mode functions. 
\subsubsection*{Non-Gaussianities}
Let us now compute the three point function from the EFT. Since we are interested in the scaling behaviour it will be enough  to compute the $\dot\pi^3$ This can be done in a similar fashion to how we computed non-Gaussianities in Sec.~\ref{sec:PNG}, but with the difference that the wave-function coefficients are different. Let us start by computing the  cubic coefficient for $\mathcal{H}_{\rm{int}}=\frac{\beta}{2f_\pi^4}\frac{\pi_\varphi^3}{a^6}$. 
The Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the cubic coefficient is,
\begin{align}
\left(\partial_\eta -\frac{1}{a^2}\sum_i c_{p_i}\right)c_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=\frac{\beta }{2 f_\pi^4a^5}\prod_{i=1}^3 c_{p_i} \,,
\end{align}
 where $c_p$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:cl_EFT}. As usual it is easier to  compute the cubic coefficient in the interaction picture,
\begin{align}
c^I_{p_1,p_2,p_3}&= \frac{\beta }{2 f_\pi^8} \int_{-\infty}^{\eta} d\eta'\  a^{-5}\prod_{i=1}^3 f_{p_i}(\eta')c_{p_i}(\eta') \,,
\end{align}
where in this case the mode function is given by,
\begin{equation}
f_p\sim(\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p(p+2)}\cos(\eta)+i\sin(\eta))e^{-i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p(p+2)}\eta} \,,
\end{equation}
and $f_\pi^2a^2\partial_\eta(\log f_p)=c_p$.
Performing the integral as we have done in Sec.~\ref{sec:PNG} and using Eq.~\eqref{eq:InteractionPictureCoefficients}, we find that the cubic coefficient evaluated at $\eta = \pi/2$ is given by,
\begin{align}
c_{p_1,p_2,p_3}=\frac{if_\pi^4  c_s^6 \beta}{H}\frac{p_1(2+p_1)p_2(2+p_2)p_3(2+p_3)}{(-2+\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_i+2)})(\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_i+2)})(2+\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_i+2)})} \,,
\end{align}
where we have used that in the $\eta\leq 0$ the mode function is given by its analytic continuation $\eta\to-iT$ such that the integral converges  at $a=0$. The cubic coefficient has an additional dependence on the speed. At leading order in the small parameter $1-c_s \ll 1$ we find,
\begin{equation}
c_{p_1,p_2,p_3} \simeq \frac{i f_\pi^4 \beta}{H}\frac{2 p_1 (p_1+2) p_2 (p_2+2) p_3
   (p_3+2)}{(p_T+1) (p_T+3)
   (p_T+5)} \,.
\end{equation}
Notice that the result coincides with one obtained in~\cite{Cespedes:2020xpn} for large $p$. Nevertheless the structure is different from flat space where correlation functions contain single poles. These poles have been related to the flat space limit of the correlation functions~\cite{Maldacena:2011nz,Raju:2012zr}. In this case we see that the poles are displaced due to the curvature. It will be interesting to investigate this issue further. Moreover it seems that for large curvature there are no single poles.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.55,trim=2.1cm 10cm 1cm 4cm,clip]{fnl_cs}
\caption{We plot the ratio between the curved space $\tilde {f}_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and the flat space $ f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. The black line corresponds to $c_s=0.9$, the orange line to $c_s=0.2$. and the grey line to $c_s=0.05$. We see that the effect of the curvature is enhanced when $c_s$ decreases. This is due to the fact that a lower speed of sound lowers the scale at which modes cross the horizon. Since the impact of the curvature is larger on large wavelength modes the the three point function is greatly modified.   \\}
\label{Fig:fnl_cs}
\end{figure}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:3PointCF} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:Epsilon} we find the three point function,
\begin{align}
\langle\zeta_{p_1}\zeta_{p_2}\zeta_{p_3}\rangle&=\frac{\beta c_s^4 H^4}{8 M_{Pl}^4\epsilon^2}\prod_{i=1}^3\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_i+2)}}\\
&\times\frac{1}{(-2+\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_1+2)})(\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_1+2)})(2+\sum_i\sqrt{1+c_s^2 p_i(p_1+2)})} \,. \nonumber
\end{align}

Notice that this expression scales as $\Delta_\zeta^4\beta$ for large $l$, which coincides with the flat space result~\cite{Senatore:2009gt}. Nevertheless for $1\ll p\lesssim 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ the scaling is different. For instance for the equilateral shape, we have that $\tilde f_{\rm NL}$ behaves as
\begin{align}
\tilde{f}^{\beta}_{\mathrm{NL}}=\beta\frac{9c_s^2 p^2(p+1)^2(p+2)^2}{(1+c_s^2 p(p+2))^2(5+9 c_s^2 p(2+p))}\sim \frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(1+\left(1-\frac{23}{9c_s^2}\right)\frac{1}{p^2}+\mathcal{O}(p^{-3})\right) \,.
\end{align}
Let us unpack this formula. We first have that there is an  overall scaling $c_s^{-2}$, which as has been pointed out before~\cite{Chen:2006nt,Cheung:2007st} can imply a larger signal than the gravitational coupling we have discussed. Moreover for small $c_s$ there is an extra contribution at small $p$ which suppresses the value of $\tilde{f}_{\mathrm{NL}}$.  This is a feature particular to the  curvature of the universe,  notice that the overall scaling is $c_s{-n}p^{-n}$  which implies that  at $c_s$ decreases other terms in the expansion also become relevant. The suppression depends heavily on $c_s$, as it can be seen from the plot in  Fig. \ref{Fig:fnl_cs}, for $c_s\sim 1$ the signal $\tilde{f}_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is  suppressed at $p \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ similarly than for the gravitational couplings. More interesting a small speed of sound causes an important effect which last up to $p\sim 100$.  Note that the speed of sound has to satisfy the bound $c_s\gg 0.003$ in order the EFT to not become strongly coupled. In any case even for mild values of $c_s$ there is a large effect of the curvature on primordial non-Gaussianity.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



In this paper we have computed correlation functions of density perturbations generated during inflation in a closed universe. Even though it is well known that the inflationary expansion dilutes the curvature, it is still an important question to ask whether it leads to any signature.

The most important part of the paper is the developing of the formalism to compute the density perturbations in a closed form. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Formalism} we were able to solve the equations determining the Schr\"odinger wave-function for a closed universe in a closed form. This differs from the flat universe case, as in a closed universe the wave-function is determined in terms of spherical harmonics relevant for the $S^3$ symmetries rather than the Fourier expansion which is typical of flat case. Yet we were able to compare with the flat space limit and agreement was found. The importance of having a closed form is that our results hold for any value of the modes $p$. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Formalism} we determined the corresponding Bunch-Davis vacuum, the two-point function and interactions after computing the wave-function in the Schr\"odinger formalism. In general we find that curvature effects may play a relevant role specially at large scales for values of $p\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$, even though in terms of observations, this regime is limited due to cosmic variance.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:PNG} we concentrated on non-Gaussianities, generalising the result of Maldacena to closed universes, illustrating the differences at large scales and checking that the two results agree at small scales as they should. Computing $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ allowed us to explicitly see how its expression includes explicit dependence on the curvature.
We have shown that the cubic order contains a term which is larger than the usual slow roll non-Gaussianity, and might lead to interesting observable consequence. 

Some of the results obtained here were discussed previously in the literature \cite{Seery:2010kh}. Nevertheless most of them had to take the approximation of small curvature (and large $p$) at the cost of not being able to accurately compute the largest contribution from the curvature. We checked that our results reduce to the results of~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr,Seery:2010kh} for large values of $p$ as expected. Furthermore, using the effective field theory of inflation we computed the effects on non-Gaussianities of a low speed of sound as it happens in higher derivative theories.

Overall, the curvature effects on non-Gaussianities are small but not totally negligible. We found terms that contribute to non-Gaussianities that may lead to observable consequences even if a long period of inflation dilutes the curvature. It may be interesting to explore these potential observational implications in more detail. One of the most promising tests of non-Gaussianity is the scale dependence of the halo bias. Since this an effect important over large scales, one could expect that our results here will lead to an enhanced signal. Still more work is needed to disentagle the scale dependent signal from the curvature, but importantly our results show that for gravitational interactions the leading non-Gaussian  signal comes from the curvature, which further suggest the importance of understanding the imprints of the curvature on large scale structure observables. 

The techniques used in this article may be generalised in several ways, if the universe is an expanding bubble, the boundary effects may be relevant, furthermore extending our results to the open universe case should be doable, noting that the underlying symmetries are different and the nature and mode expansion of the wave-function will require a separate calculation.
 It will also be possible to study interactions with other particles. The effect of the curvature at large scales suggest that there might be important effects on the cosmological collider~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2015bza} which will be interesting to explore.

\section{Introduction}
Moduli fields, scalar fields describing the size and shape of extra dimensions, are generic in string theory. It is well-known that moduli are displaced from their low-energy minimum during and after inflation~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci,Banks:1993en,deCarlos:1993wie}. As it is expected that there are $\mathcal{O}(100)$ moduli fields, it is a natural question to ask for phenomenological consequences of moduli displacement in the early Universe. For example, it has been argued that these moduli lead to a deviation from the standard thermal history of a radiation dominated Universe shortly after inflation. An additional period of matter (i.e.~moduli) domination takes place. This can lead to additional contributions of dark radiation~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}, baryogenesis~\cite{Allahverdi:2016yws} and a non-thermal production of dark matter~\cite{Allahverdi:2013noa} (see~\cite{Kane:2015jia} for a review).

Moduli fields $\phi$ become dynamical when the relevant scales in the potential $V(\phi)$ are of order the Hubble scale $H$, in particular when the friction term $3H\dot{\phi}$ is of order $V'(\phi_{\rm displaced}).$ 
Phenomenologically, the absence of a cosmological moduli problem~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci,Banks:1993en,deCarlos:1993wie} sets a lower scale of roughly 30 TeV to the masses of moduli. Advances in our understanding of moduli potentials allow us to address the relevance of moduli in the early Universe. By now there are well worked out scenarios of moduli stabilisation in various corners of string theory and much attention has been devoted to the type IIB scenarios of KKLT~\cite{Kachru:2003aw} and the Large Volume Scenario (LVS)~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx,Conlon:2005ki}. For concreteness we concentrate in this paper on these scenarios of type IIB string theory. Here, the moduli masses are hierarchically below the string scale and are described within a four dimensional effective ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity field theory.

This property is generic in string compactifications with low-energy supersymmetry for which the presence of such light moduli can be understood from general field theory arguments in supergravity~\cite{deCarlos:1993wie, 0804.3730, 0804.1073,0706.2785,hep-th/0602246,hep-th/0606273}. The lightest non-axionic modulus, is associated to the scalar partner of the Goldstino. Its mass is lower or equal to the gravitino mass of a given setup. In string theory, the consistency of the four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ effective field theory requires that the gravitino mass and hence at least one modulus has a mass below the compactification and the string scale.

In this article we consider  a possible phenomenological consequence of moduli displacement: the production of oscillons. Oscillons are spatially localised oscillating scalar field configurations which are long-lived with respect to the characteristic time scale of oscillations. In these regions the modulus oscillates with large amplitude. They have been studied in the context of field theory models (of inflation)~\cite{Gleiser:1993pt,Copeland:1995fq,Copeland:2002ku,Broadhead:2005hn,Farhi:2005rz,Fodor:2006zs,Graham:2006vy,Gleiser:2007te,Amin:2011hj,Achilleos:2013zpa,Gleiser:2014ipa,Antusch:2015nla,Antusch:2015ziz,Bond:2015zfa,Liu:2017hua,Antusch:2016con} including potentials that appear in axion monodromy inflation in string theory~\cite{1304.6094} (although neglecting moduli stabilisation). The production of oscillons depends on whether the shape of the potential supports such localised scalar field configurations as well as the sufficient growth of perturbations\footnote{For a review on the non-perturbative dynamics during preheating after inflation, see e.g.~\cite{Amin:2014eta}.} and  the corresponding cosmological history. 

Oscillons have been found to be present in many field theories for single real scalar fields  for which the corresponding scalar potential flattens out close to its minimum. This causes an effective attractive interaction among the scalar field particles that triggers these time-dependent energy lumps to form. When present, oscillons can substantially affect the cosmological evolution of the Universe. They can dominate the energy density  before decaying and delay thermalisation. They could also catalyse the implementation of second and relatively weak first order phase transitions, be a source of baryon asymmetry, gravitational waves, etc. It is then important to see if they have a role in string cosmology during and after inflation.

 In this article we start exploring the role of oscillons in the rich structure of scalar potentials for string theory moduli. Given the magnitude of the energy landscape with hundreds  of scalar fields,  quasi-stable field configurations could play an important role in the cosmological dynamics of the theory.
 With respect to moduli displacements in the early Universe, we present two examples where we find the production of oscillons numerically. The first example is that of a displaced volume modulus in KKLT. The second example is based on the LVS where we find oscillons from displacing so-called blow-up moduli.\footnote{For this example, our analysis extends the work in~\cite{Barnaby:2009wr} in which reheating after K\"ahler moduli inflation was studied in detail although the presence of oscillons was not discussed.}
 We also find that in the context of string moduli the production of oscillons is model dependent. Some moduli potentials do not give rise to oscillons such as the overall volume  or K\"ahler moduli associated to fibrations in the LVS. In the current analysis, which should serve as a proof of concept, we treat the initial displacement as a phenomenological parameter. Connecting with a fully-fledged UV setup including an early inflationary period (or alternatives) the initial displacement would be explicitly determined. Here we will not assume a  particular model of string inflation but consider only the dynamics of moduli fields when relaxing towards their zero-temperature vacuum. 

Depending on the type of  configuration, oscillons can produce gravitational radiation, which has been studied in the context of axion monodromy inflation~\cite{1304.6094} and more recently during preheating after hilltop inflation~\cite{Antusch:2016con}, and leads to a distinct phenomenological signal of oscillons. In general, the frequency of gravitational waves (GWs) is related to the energy scales involved in the scalar (moduli) potential. This scale can be distinct from the energy scales responsible for GWs from preheating after inflation. This hence can lead to GWs produced at lower frequencies, potentially in the range experimentally tested by current experiments (e.g.~LIGO). Both of our examples lead to a production of stochastic gravitational waves which can feature a peak at the characteristic oscillon frequency. More generally, each moduli potential has its characteristic GW spectrum from various GW production mechanisms and carries a rich information about the field dynamics in this period. We also comment on how a subsequent period of moduli domination (until the lightest modulus decays before BBN) affects the stochastic gravitational wave background produced from earlier phases of ``moduli preheating''.

In the context of hilltop inflation, it has been found in \cite{Antusch:2015nla} that the strong amplification of the perturbations can lead to localised regions which overshoot over the barrier that separates the considered minimum from other minima in the potential. For the hilltop model it turned out that such an overshooting is unproblematic since the overshooting bubbles quickly collapse. A similar situation can in principle appear for moduli potentials, e.g.\ the KKLT scenario and the LVS are examples where such overshooting over the barrier could be present.  For these two examples, we find that such overshootings do not occur and hence provide an additional check on the longevity of these metastable configurations. 

In Section~\ref{sec:general} we summarise the basic requirements for the production of oscillons, then comment on how moduli potentials provide a very promising arena to the production of oscillons, and finally we introduce the common numerical methods used for studying the evolution of the perturbations. In Section~\ref{sec:example} we present explicit examples for the production of oscillons, before concluding in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}. In Appendix~\ref{sec:discussion and other models} we discuss further moduli potentials which only lead to a homogeneous field evolution.


\section{Introduction to Oscillons}
\label{sec:general}


Before studying the appearance of oscillons in string theory, let us first recall some conditions on the production of oscillons. We then comment on when we expect to produce oscillons from string moduli.
\subsection{Oscillons in effective field theories}
\label{sec:oscillonproduction}

We concentrate on the case of a single scalar field $\phi$ with a potential $V(\phi)$ with a Langrangian of the form:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}= \int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{M_{\rm Pl}^2}{2}\, R -\frac{1}{2}\,\partial^\mu\phi\,\partial_\mu \phi - V(\phi)\right).
\end{equation}
Here $M_{\rm Pl}$ is the reduced Planck  mass and $R$ the Ricci scalar. We will study the cosmological evolution of the field $\phi$ on a FLRW background:
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t)\, d{\bf x}^2\,,
\end{equation}
with $a(t)$ the scale factor.

In order to study the production of oscillons, it is convenient to express the scalar field $\phi$ involved in the process as the sum of a (spatially averaged) homogeneous background and a perturbation: $\phi(t,\vec{x})=\phi(t) + \delta\phi(t,\vec{x})$. The homogeneous component obeys the equations of motion
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:homogeneousEOM}
\ddot{\phi}(t) + 3 H \dot{\phi}(t) + V'(\phi(t)) = 0\,,\quad\textrm{with}\quad H^2(t)=\frac{1}{3\,M^2_{\rm Pl}}\left(\frac{\dot{\phi}^2(t)}{2}+V(\phi(t))\right).
\end{equation}
The perturbation $\delta\phi$ can, in turn, be decomposed into Fourier modes $\delta \phi_k$: \begin{equation}
\delta\phi(t,\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{\rm D}k}{(2\pi)^{\rm D}}~ \delta \phi_k(t)~e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}}\,,
\label{eq:fourier}
\end{equation}
where D is the number of spatial dimensions. In $D = 3$ the equation of motion for the Fourier modes takes the familiar form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:perturbationEOM}
\delta \ddot{\phi}_k + 3 H \delta \dot{\phi}_k + \left(\frac{k^2}{a^2(t)} + V''(\phi(t))\right) \delta \phi_k = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
with initial conditions set by vacuum fluctuations
\begin{equation}
\delta\phi_k \simeq \frac{H}{\sqrt{2k^3}}\left(i+\frac{k}{a\,H}\right)e^{i\,k/(aH)}\,.
\label{eq:IC_fluctuations}
\end{equation}
Three necessary conditions for the formation of oscillons are (see for instance~\cite{Gleiser:1993pt,Amin:2010dc}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The field perturbations $\delta\phi$ grow as the field oscillates about the minimum of the potential.
\item The growth of the field perturbations is sufficiently strong for non-linear interactions to become important.
\item The potential \textit{opens up} away from the minimum or in other words it is \textit{shallower than quadratic} in some field space region relevant for the field dynamics\footnote{A precise condition for small amplitude oscillons including also non-canonical kinetic terms has been discussed in \cite{Amin:2013ika}}.
\end{enumerate}
The third requirement is necessary for the potential to support localised configurations of the scalar field: if this condition is not satisfied the fragmentation of the scalar field obtained as a consequence of the growth of the perturbations does not lead to the formation of oscillons (as e.g.\ in \cite{Felder:2006cc}). Intuitively, contrary to a quadratic potential, a potential shallower than quadratic (e.g. $V=m^2\phi^2-\lambda\phi^4+\cdots$ for small $\phi$) implies that there is an attractive interaction ($\lambda>0$) among the scalar particles implying that boson condensation leading to oscillon production is energetically favoured. 

In order to study the formation of oscillons it is always crucial to check the production explicitly, e.g.~through lattice simulation (see Section~\ref{sec:numerical methods}). The growth of perturbations though can be obtained in various ways. 
Discussions in the literature typically consider preheating after inflation. The same mechanisms can also occur in moduli preheating. 
The mechanisms can be classified in terms of the region of the potential probed by the background field during the growth of perturbations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Tachyonic preheating.} Tachyonic preheating occurs if the scalar field is initially displaced beyond the inflection point near the minimum and takes place when the field rolls in the region of the scalar potential where $V''(\phi(t)) < 0$ toward the minimum of the potential.  
As the field rolls through the tachyonic region, all the infrared modes $\delta \phi_k$ such that $k^2/a^2 + \partial^2 V/\partial\phi^2<0$ grow exponentially.  
The importance of tachyonic preheating depends, of course, on the initial displacement of the modulus field. It is in principle possible that non-linear interactions between different modes $\delta \phi_k$ become important already at this stage, however, for the models considered in this paper it turns out that this mechanism is subdominant. Especially for the models in which oscillon production takes place, tachyonic preheating is always followed by another, more efficient mechanism for the growth of fluctuations.
\item \textit{Tachyonic oscillations.} Tachyonic oscillations happen when the field crosses periodically the inflection point $\partial^2V/\partial\phi^2=0$ as it oscillates about the minimum, probing both the region where $V''(\phi(t)) > 0$ and the region where $V''(\phi(t)) < 0$. During each oscillation, the field perturbations grow in the tachyonic region as the field accelerates toward the minimum (downhill) and decrease as the field decelerates toward the plateau (uphill). This, combined with the expansion of the Universe and the periodic crossing of the inflection point, leads to a net growth of the field perturbations peaked at a characteristic wavenumber
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Kpeak}
k_p \lesssim \left.\sqrt{\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^2}}\right|_{\rm min} \equiv ~ m \,,
\end{equation}
closely related to the frequency of the oscillations of the homogeneous mode at the time of production~\cite{Brax:2010ai,Antusch:2015nla}. When the expansion rate is small compared to the frequency of the background oscillations (weak damping of oscillations) and it hence allows for a sufficient number of tachyonic oscillations, non-linear interactions between fluctuations with different wavenumbers become important, and the system enters a non-perturbative phase. Heuristically, the larger the ratio $m/H$ the smaller the damping becomes. In case the damping is large, the field quickly relaxes to the minimum and this mechanism for the growth of perturbations is not efficient (see Appendix~\ref{sec:discussion and other models}).

\item \textit{Parametric resonance.} Parametric resonance can occur when the background field $\phi(t)$ oscillates around the minimum of its potential for fluctuations $\delta\phi_k$ which have a time-dependent frequency
\begin{equation}
\omega^2_k(t)  = \frac{k^2}{a^2} + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial\phi^2}\,.
\end{equation}
Especially, if $\omega_k(t)$ varies non-adiabatically, i.e.\ when the adiabatic condition
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{\dot{\omega}_k(t)}{\omega^2_k(t)}\right|\ll1\,,
\end{equation}
is violated, a window of modes can experience exponential growth and the scalar field eventually fragments. This mechanism of amplification of the perturbations is extensively explored in the literature~\cite{Kofman:1994rk,Kofman:1997yn} and the growth of perturbations in the case of axion monodromy is an example of parametric resonance at work~\cite{Zhou:2013tsa}.
\end{itemize}
Let us briefly comment on the production of gravitational waves from preheating with oscillons: During an early phase of tachyonic preheating, gravitational waves with comparatively low $k$ (limited by $H$ at this time) can be produced. When, on the other hand, the zero mode survives for several (or many more) oscillations, then tachyonic oscillations can generate a rather broad peak in the spectrum of gravitational waves around $k \sim k_p$, which then gets redshifted as the Universe expands. E.g.\ via tachyonic oscillations, or via parametric resonance, oscillons can be produced which then further contribute to the gravitational wave spectrum. In addition to gravitational waves generated during oscillon production \cite{Zhou:2013tsa}, oscillons can provide a continuous source for gravitational waves as long as they are asymmetric \cite{Antusch:2016con}. In this phase, oscillons can generate a pronounced peak in the gravitational wave spectrum at the oscillation frequency of the oscillons ($k \sim m$, with $m$ being the mass at the minimum of the potential) and also further subdominant peaks from higher harmonics at multiples of this frequency. Finally, when oscillons decay, additional gravitational waves are produced. Details will be discussed later in this Section and in Section \ref{sec:example}.  


\subsection{Potential for oscillon production in string theory}
By now there is a whole plethora of moduli potentials known from string theory, in parts motivated by the construction of models of de Sitter moduli stabilisation and inflation in string theory~\cite{Baumann:2014nda}. This includes polynomial type potentials for complex structure moduli, periodic potentials for axions, and exponential potentials for K\"ahler moduli, just to name a few. In general it is expected that there are many $\mathcal{O}(100)$ moduli fields and that their dynamics are encoded in their multi-field scalar potential. The aim of this paper is only to provide a first survey of this rich class of potentials.

The standard picture is that (one of) the moduli fields will drive inflation, while the other fields are trapped at their minimum of the potential. However, the minimum during inflation $\langle\phi_{\rm inf}\rangle$ for these moduli fields depends on the position of the inflaton field and generically is different from the post-inflationary minimum. After inflation ends, these moduli fields are displaced from their minimum and locked at these displaced values until Hubble friction $3H\dot{\phi}$ becomes comparable to $V'(\phi).$
The displacement is set by the inflationary potential and can be calculated in a UV model (see for instance~\cite{Cicoli:2016olq} for an example). To be independent from inflationary model building, we keep the initial displacement as a free parameter. For simplicity we also restrict ourselves to single field examples. The cartoon picture is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:potentialsketch}.

\caption{Sketch of a moduli potential near its post-inflationary minimum $\phi_{\rm final}.$ If the initial displacement $\phi_{\rm initial}$ is in the yellow region the modulus is displaced in the tachyonic region of the potential and tachyonic preheating (oscillations) can take place.}
\label{fig:potentialsketch}
\end{figure}

For concreteness let us concentrate on IIB string compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds that lead to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry in 4-dimensions. The set of (closed string) moduli fields are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\it Dilaton and complex structure moduli.} The model independent dilaton field $S$ and the many (usually of order $10^2-10^3$) complex structure moduli $U_\alpha$ measuring the size of Calabi-Yau 3-cycles. Their scalar potential is determined by fluxes of the two 3-form fields of IIB strings: $F_{MNP}, H_{MNP}$. Fluxes of these fields are quantised from Dirac quantisation condition with integers bound by general tadpole conditions but otherwise arbitrary. Varying the corresponding integers is the source of the huge landscape of string vacua. The potential for these fields is determined by the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential $W=\int G_3\wedge \Omega$ where $G_{MNP}= F_{MNP}+SH_{MNP}$ and $\Omega $ is the unique $(3,0)$ form of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Their K\"ahler potential is $K_{\rm cs}+K_S$ with $K_{cs}=-\log{\left(\int\Omega\wedge \Omega^*\right)}$ and $K_S=-\log(S+S^*)$. They give rise to a scalar potential of order string scale (or below) and are minimised by the condition $D_UW=D_SW=0$. We will assume these fields are sitting in their minimum but in a more general discussion they may be considered as potential sources of oscillons during their cosmological evolution.

\item{} {\it K\"ahler moduli.} These are $T_i=\tau_i+{\mathrm i} a_i$ where $\tau_i$ measure the size of the 4-cycles of the Calabi-Yau manifold and $a_i$ are axion-like fields. For concreteness we will only concentrate on the potential for the fields $\tau_i$ where $i=1,\cdots, h_{11}$ where the Hodge number $h_{11}$ measures the number of non-trivial 4-cycles which ranges from one up to several hundreds for known manifolds. Among these fields there are three classes that are usually distinguished: the overall volume modulus, blow-up modes (measuring the size of cycles that can be collapsed to zero size) and fibre moduli (measuring the size of fibrations which are generic in Calabi-Yau manifolds). We will discuss potentials for each of these classes generated by non-perturbative superpotentials and K\"ahler potentials that will be written explicitly below. Again their axionic partners could also be sources of oscillons that we will not consider at this stage.

\end{itemize}
To be specific, let us focus on the dynamics of K\"ahler moduli in type IIB string theory. For such moduli, the potential takes the schematic form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=\sum_{j=0}^n C_j e^{-a_j  \phi}+\ldots~,
\end{equation}
where the number of relevant terms $n,$ the coefficients $C_j$ and $a_j$ are model dependent,  the dots include terms with multiple exponentials $e^{-e^\phi}.$ The coefficients $C_j$ and $a$ can have a mild (i.e.~polynomial) dependence on the moduli. The characteristic exponential structure for the potential arises due to two distinct reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The shift symmetry of the K\"ahler moduli forbids perturbative terms in the superpotential depending on the K\"ahler moduli. Only non-perturbative contributions, hence exponentials, can arise in the superpotential. An example of such a generation of terms is the case of blow-up moduli in the LVS which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:KMI}.
\item The K\"ahler potential of the overall volume modulus $K/M^2_{\rm Pl}=-2\log{{\mathcal V}}$ leads to a canonically normalised volume of the form $\phi/M_{\rm Pl}\simeq \log{{\mathcal V}}.$ Although ${\cal V}$ appears polynomially in the potential, the potential for the canonically normalised field is exponential. Examples of such terms arise in our discussion of the overall volume modulus in KKLT (cf. Section~\ref{sec:KKLT}) and in the LVS (cf. Section~\ref{sec:LVS}).
\end{enumerate}
The minimum in these potentials arises from a balancing of various effects which scale differently with respect to moduli (e.g.~$\alpha'-$corrections and non perturbative corrections in the LVS). This distinct scaling on both sides of the potential generically leads to the appearance of asymmetric potentials. For example in the context of blow-up moduli in the LVS (cf.~Section~\ref{sec:KMI}), the potential schematically takes the following form:
\begin{equation}
V=V_0(1-\kappa e^{-\alpha\phi})^2~.
\label{eq:pkm}
\end{equation}
This potential is asymmetric about the minimum, features an inflection point at $\phi_{\rm inf}\simeq\ln(2\kappa)/\alpha$ and is clearly shallower than quadratic.\footnote{Note that a similar opening up is expected in the case of flux potentials for complex structure moduli where the back-reaction of the fluxes on the geometry leads to an effective flattening of the potential~\cite{Landete:2017amp}.} The precise form of the prefactor, e.g.~a polynomial moduli dependence of $\kappa$, and the coefficient in the exponential $\alpha$ are model dependent. In fact the potential shape is qualitatively similar to the case of hilltop-like potentials of the form:
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=V_0\left(1-\left(\frac{\phi}{v}\right)^p\right)^2\,.
\label{eq:phi}
\end{equation} 
Such potentials have been studied in the context of inflation~\cite{Linde:1981mu,Izawa:1996dv,Izawa:1997df,Senoguz:2004ky,Boubekeur:2005zm} and are known to support oscillons in large regions of their parameter space~\cite{Antusch:2015nla,Antusch:2015vna,Antusch:2015ziz,Antusch:2016con}. Given the similar qualitative features of potentials (\ref{eq:pkm}) and (\ref{eq:phi}), we expect (and will show) similar conclusions to be valid for K\"ahler moduli. 

In potentials of the form of Equations~(\ref{eq:pkm}) and (\ref{eq:phi}) the necessary conditions that we have listed above are satisfied. For a sufficient initial displacement, the growth of field perturbations happens via tachyonic preheating and tachyonic oscillations: the amplitude of the Fourier modes $\delta \phi_k$ grows when the homogeneous field $\phi(t)$ accelerates through a tachyonic region of the potential, i.e.~for regions of the potential such that $k^2/a^2(2) + V''(\phi(t)) < 0$. In particular, for the potential in Equation~\eqref{eq:pkm} the growth of perturbations takes place for field values $\phi > \log(2 \kappa)/\alpha$.

Generically such regions where perturbations grow can be found in potentials for K\"ahler moduli near the minimum. Whether the perturbations grow sufficiently large depends on the coefficients in the potential $C_j,~a_j$ and is hence model dependent. Similarly whether the conditions for parametric resonance are satisfied depends on the parameter in the moduli potential.

In the case that perturbations grow sufficiently, gravitational radiation is produced. After its production, the spectrum of gravitational radiation is redshifted according to the subsequent evolution of the Universe. The presence of many moduli in string models could lead to a modification of the standard big bang picture, that features a single period of radiation domination lasting from reheating after inflation to radiation/matter equality. In fact, a modulus $\Phi$ oscillating around its minimum can lead to a phase of matter domination which lasts until the modulus decays when the Hubble parameter becomes comparable to the decay rate of the modulus itself $\Gamma_\Phi\simeq m_{\Phi}^3/M_{\rm Pl}^2$. To avoid the cosmological moduli problem this lightest modulus has to decay before BBN, setting an upper bound on the duration of this phase of matter domination. Given the existence of many moduli in string models, in general there can be many periods of matter domination. Concerning oscillon and GW production, we can have two different situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Oscillons and consequently GWs are produced by the dynamics of the lightest mod- ulus and are followed by a radiation dominated phase.
\item After oscillon and GW production, there is at least one additional displaced lighter modulus which can dominate the energy density of the Universe, leading to at least one additional epoch of matter domination.
\end{itemize}
Since during matter domination the Universe expands more rapidly than during radiation domination, the abundance of GWs produced by oscillons is more diluted when matter domination lasts longer. In order to compute the actual dilution, it is necessary to evaluate the evolution of the scale factor. For concreteness, let $\Phi$ be the lightest modulus. Oscillons and GWs are produced either by $\Phi$ itself or by a heavier modulus. Let us also assume that matter domination lasts from GW production to the decay of $\Phi$\footnote{In the most generic picture there could be several alternate matter and radiation domination eras.}. We denote by $t_{\rm e}$ the time of production of GWs, by $t_{*}$ the time of decay of $\Phi$ determined by $\Gamma_\Phi \simeq m_\Phi^3/M_{\rm Pl}^2 \sim H(t_{*})$ and by $t_0$ the current epoch. We assume that after the decay of $\Phi$ the thermal bath of relativistic particles obeys entropy conservation, so that $g(T) a^3 T^3 \sim \rm const.$, where $g(T)$ is the number of relativistic degreees of freedom at temperature $T$. Then, the evolution of the scale factor can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scalefactorevolution}
\mathcal{R} \equiv \frac{a\left(t_{\rm e}\right)}{a\left(t_{0}\right)} = \frac{a\left(t_{\rm e}\right)}{a\left(t_{*}\right)} \frac{a\left(t_{*}\right)}{a\left(t_{0}\right)} = \frac{\rho_{*}^{1/3}}{\rho_{\rm e}^{1/3}} \left(\frac{g_{ 0}}{g_{*}}\right)^{1/3} \frac{T_{0}}{T_{*}} = \left(\frac{g_{0}}{g_{*}}\right)^{1/12} \frac{\rho_{*}^{1/12}}{\rho_{\rm e}^{1/3}}~\rho_{0, \rm rad}^{1/4}\,,
\end{equation}
where we have used that during matter domination $\rho \sim a^{-3}$, while during radiation domination $\rho \sim g(T) T^4$. In general $\rho_{\rm e}$ can be inferred by the numerical simulations, while $\rho_{*}$ is determined by the reheating temperature $\rho_{*} = \frac{\pi^2}{30} g(T) T_{*}^4$, where $T_{\rm dec} = \sqrt{\Gamma_\Phi M_{\rm Pl}}$. Finally $\rho_{0, \rm rad}$ is the energy density in radiation in the current epoch, and can be written in terms of the critical density $\rho_{\rm crit} \sim 10 \,\rm GeV/m^3$: $\rho_{0, \rm rad} = 4.3 \times 10^{-5} \, \rho_{\rm crit}$. From Equation~\eqref{eq:scalefactorevolution} it is evident that the longer the matter domination epoch (i.e. the smaller the energy density at the decay of the lightest modulus $\Phi$) the smaller is the ratio between the scale factors at the GW production epoch and today.

Since GWs redshift as radiation, the abundance of GWs today is suppressed by the fourth power of the ratio $\mathcal{R}$
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} = \mathcal{R}^4 \, \Omega_{\rm GW, e}\,.
\label{eq:rescaling1}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the frequency $f$ of GWs gets redshifted as usual
\begin{equation}
f_0 = \mathcal{R} \, f_{\rm e}\,.
\label{eq:rescaling2}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Numerical methods}
\label{sec:numerical methods}
The dynamics of a scalar field in an expanding Universe essentially depends on the exact shape of its potential. For the various models considered in this paper, the latter typically depends on multiple parameters. Although the shape of the potentials can be qualitatively similar for different choices of parameter sets, the overall dynamics can vary significantly. While for some regions of the parameter space, the field may be well described by the homogeneous evolution, others may support a strong amplification of scalar field perturbations eventually leading to non-perturbative dynamics.

To study the evolution of the scalar field perturbations we use different common methods which we describe below in this section. In general, the procedure is as follows: To determine whether and at which scales the fluctuations can potentially experience a phase of rapid growth, for a given model, we use Floquet theory. To get a rough impression on whether the dynamics are expected to be mild or rather violent we may also consider model specific quantities like, for instance, $m/H$ specifically for models where the situation is less clear (e.g.\ when the parameter space is larger). Based on the results of the Floquet analysis we either solve the fully non-linear equations of motion in an expanding Universe using lattice simulations, or we solve the linearised equations for the perturbations Equation~\eqref{eq:perturbationEOM} in cases where no non-linear effects are expected.  


\subsubsection{Floquet analysis}
\label{sec:floquet analysis}
A Floquet analysis is only applicable during the linear regime, i.e.\ when the fluctuations are small compared to the motion of the background $\phi(t)$ and only if the motion of the background is periodic. The latter is certainly not the case in an expanding Universe. Nevertheless, for a first exploration of the dynamics we can use Floquet theory to compute the growth rate of the fluctuations in Minkowski space. If the growth rate is large compared to the expansion rate of the Universe this is typically a reliable indicator for the perturbations to experience a phase of rapid growth.

In Minkowski space the linearised equations for the modes $\delta\phi_k$ Equation~\eqref{eq:perturbationEOM} reduce to
\begin{equation}
\delta\ddot{\phi}_k(t) + \left(k^2 + \frac{\partial^2V(\phi(t))}{\partial \phi(t)^2}\right)\delta\phi_k(t) = 0\,,
\label{eq:Minkowski_fluct}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(t)$ is the homogeneous background field. Since $\partial^2V(\phi)/\partial \phi^2$ is now periodic, Equation~\eqref{eq:Minkowski_fluct} has the form of Hill's equation and according to the Floquet theorem the solutions can be written as
\begin{equation}
\delta\phi_k(t) = P_+(t)e^{\mu_k\,t} + P_-(t)e^{-\mu_k\,t}\,,
\end{equation}
where the $\mu_k$ are called Floquet exponents and the $P_{\pm}$ are periodic functions with the same period as $\partial^2V(\phi)/\partial \phi^2$. For fluctuations $\delta\phi_k$ for which the Floquet exponent exhibits a non-vanishing real part $\Re[\mu_k]$ the solution will be exponentially growing. Moreover, if the growth rate is much larger compared to the expansion rate $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H \gg 1$, this is a reliable indicator for the corresponding mode to get significantly amplified in an expanding Universe. The Floquet exponents are typically computed numerically via a Floquet analysis. We can rewrite Equation~\eqref{eq:Minkowski_fluct} as a first-order system of linear differential equations 
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}(t)=U(t)x(t)\,,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
U(t) = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ -k^2-\frac{\partial^2V(\phi)}{\partial \phi^2} & 0 \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
and defining $x(t)=(\delta\phi_k , \delta\pi_k)^T$ where
\begin{equation}
\delta\pi_k \equiv \delta\dot{\phi}_k\,.
\end{equation}
The Floquet exponents can then be computed in three steps as follows (see Ref.\cite{Amin:2014eta} for more details)
\begin{enumerate}
\item We first compute the period $T$ of the system assuming that the field is at rest at $t=0$, i.e.\ $\dot{\phi}_{\rm initial}\equiv\dot{\phi}(0)=0$:
\begin{equation}
T = 2\int_{\phi_{\rm minimal}}^{\phi_{\rm maximal}} \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{2V(\phi_{\rm maximal}) - 2V(\phi)}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\rm initial}\equiv\phi(0)=\phi_{\rm minimal}$ (or $\phi_{\rm maximal}$) is the initial field value and the maximal and minimal field amplitudes $\phi_{\rm maximal}$ and $\phi_{\rm minimal}$ are calculated by solving $V(\phi_{\rm minimal}) = V(\phi_{\rm maximal})$. 
\item After having computed the period $T$ we solve the equation for the homogeneous background in Minkowski space and simultaneously Equation~\eqref{eq:Minkowski_fluct} from $t=0$ to $t=T$ and for two sets of initial conditions $\{\delta\phi_{k,1}(0) = 1,\delta\dot{\phi}_{k,1}(0) = 0\}$ and $\{\delta\phi_{k,2}(0) = 0,\delta\dot{\phi}_{k,2}(0) = 1\}$.
\item Finally, the Floquet exponents are computed as
\begin{equation}
\Re[\mu^{\pm}_k] = \frac{1}{T}\ln |\sigma^{\pm}_{k}|
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{\pm}_{k} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\phi_{k,1} + \delta\dot{\phi}_{k,2} \pm \sqrt{\left[\delta\phi_{k,1} - \delta\dot{\phi}_{k,2}\right]^2 + 4\,\delta\phi_{k,2}\delta\dot{\phi}_{k,1}}\right)
\end{equation}
with all quantities being evaluated at $t=T$.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Lattice simulations}
\label{sec:lattice simulations}
To properly capture the evolution of the field in models where we expect a strong growth of perturbations we perform numerical lattice simulations using a modified version of LatticeEasy~\cite{Felder:2000hq}. The program is originally written to solve the fully non-linear equations of motion of scalar fields in an expanding Universe. For the case of a single scalar field the program solves the following set of equations on a discrete spacetime lattice
\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot{\phi}\, + \, 3H\dot{\phi}\, - \,\frac{1}{a^2}\nabla^2\phi\, + \,\frac{\partial V}{\partial\phi} \, = \, 0\,, \label{eq:EOM_fld} \\
H^2\, = \,\frac{1}{3M^2_{\rm{Pl}}}\left( V\,  + \,\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2\, + \frac{1}{2a^2}\left|\nabla\phi\right|^2 \right)\,, \label{eq:EOM_hubble}
\end{eqnarray}
with initial fluctuations given by quantum vacuum fluctuations \cite{Polarski:1995jg,Khlebnikov:1996mc}. On the lattice this is realised by initializing the fluctuations as random variables with a Rayleigh distributed  magnitude and with randomly uniformly distributed phase (see Ref.~\cite{Felder:2000hq}).


In addition to Equation~\eqref{eq:EOM_fld} and \eqref{eq:EOM_hubble} the code has been extended to compute the evolution of the transverse and traceless (TT) part of the metric perturbation in the synchronous gauge, where the line element takes the form
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t)(\delta_{ij} + h_{ij})dx^idx^j\,.
\end{equation}
The gravitational waves, $h_{ij}$, are sourced by TT-part of the anisotropic stress of the scalar field
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{ij}^{\rm TT} =\frac{1}{a^2}\left[\partial_i\phi\partial_j\phi\right]^{\rm TT}\,,
\label{eq:effective_source_term}
\end{equation}
where on the right hand side of Equation~\eqref{eq:effective_source_term} we kept only the terms that are linear in the gravitational coupling. The evolution of the GW is given by
\begin{equation}
\ddot{h}_{ij}\, + \,3H\dot{h}_{ij}\, - \,\frac{1}{a^2}\nabla^2h_{ij}\, = \,\frac{2}{M^2_{\rm Pl}}\Pi_{ij}^{\rm TT}~,
\label{eq:EOM_metric_perturbation}
\end{equation} 
where the initial conditions for the metric perturbations are $h_{ij}(0)=\dot{h}_{ij}(0)=0.$
Instead of directly solving for the $h_{ij}$, however, our code computes the evolution of the (non-transverse and non-traceless) tensor $u_{ij}$ 
\begin{equation}
\ddot{u}_{ij}\, + \,3H\dot{u}_{ij}\, - \,\frac{1}{a^2}\nabla^2u_{ij}\, = \,\frac{2}{M^2_{\rm Pl}}\frac{1}{a^2}\partial_i\phi\partial_j\phi~,
\label{eq:EOM_metric_perturbation_NON-TT}
\end{equation}
and projects out the TT part of $u_{ij}$ only when output is generated. This procedure saves a considerable amount of computation time but is mathematically equivalent to directly solving Equation~\eqref{eq:EOM_metric_perturbation} \cite{GarciaBellido:2007af}. The TT projection is performed in Fourier space according to
\begin{equation}
h_{ij}(\textbf{k},t) = \left(P_{il}(\textbf{\textbf{\^{k}}})P_{jm}(\textbf{\textbf{\^{k}}}) - \frac{1}{2}\,P_{ij}
(\textbf{\textbf{\^{k}}})P_{lm}(\textbf{\^{k}})\right)u_{ij}(\textbf{k},t)~,
\end{equation}
where $P_{ij}$ is the projection tensor defined as
\begin{equation}
P_{ij}(\textbf{\^{k}}) \equiv \delta_{ij} - \hat{k}_i\hat{k}_j\,,\qquad\textrm{with}\quad\hat{k}_i \equiv k_i/|\textbf{k}|\,.
\end{equation}
Ultimately, the spectrum of GW per logarithmic momentum interval is computed
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm GW}(k) \, = \,\frac{1}{\rho_{\rm c}}\,k\,\frac{d\,\rho_{\rm GW}}{dk}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm c} = 3\,M^2_{\rm Pl}H^2\,$ is the critical density of the Universe. The energy density of the GW is 
\begin{equation} 
\rho_{\rm GW}(t) = \frac{M^2_{\rm Pl}}{4}\,\left\langle\dot{h}_{ij}(\textbf{x},t)\dot{h}_{ij}(\textbf{x},t)\right\rangle_{\rm{V}}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\langle...\rangle_{\rm V}$ denoting an average over a sufficiently large volume, containing several wavelengths of the GW.


The spectrum $\Omega_{\rm GW, \rm e}(k)$ refers to the spectrum at the time when the GWs are emitted. In order to get the spectrum which would be observable today $\Omega_{\rm GW,0}(f)$, where $f$ is the frequency in Hz of the GWs, we have to take into account the expansion history of the Universe between the emission of the GWs and today. This leads to the following rescalings for the power spectrum (cf.~Equation~\eqref{eq:rescaling1})
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm GW,0} = \frac{4.3}{10^5}\left(\frac{a_{\rm e}}{a_*}\right)^{1-3w}\,\left(\frac{g_*}{g_0}\right)^{-1/3}\,\Omega_{\rm GW,\rm e}~,
\label{eq:OmegaGW_today}
\end{equation}
where $a_{\rm e}$ is the scale factor at the moment of emission, $a_*$ is the scale factor at the end of reheating and $w$ is the average equation of state parameter between the moment of emission and the end of reheating. We use $g_*/g_0=100$, where $g_*$ and $g_0$ are the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the end of reheating and today, respectively. For the frequency of the GW we have (cf.~Equation~\eqref{eq:rescaling2})
\begin{equation}
f_0 = 4\times10^{10}\,\left(\frac{a_{\rm e}}{a_*}\right)^{\frac{1-3w}{4}} \frac{k}{a_{\rm e}\rho_{\rm e}^{1/4}}\,\textrm{Hz}~,
\label{eq:GW_freq_today}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm e}$ is the energy density at the time where the GWs are emitted.



\section{Oscillons from K\"ahler  moduli}
\label{sec:example}
Let us now turn to the discussion of concrete examples where we find the formation of asymmetric oscillons which lead to a production of a stochastic gravitational wave background. 


\subsection{KKLT}
\label{sec:KKLT}
The first example is that of the overall volume modulus in KKLT~\cite{Kachru:2003aw} with a single overall \Kahler modulus $T.$ After integrating out the complex structure moduli and the dilaton at their supersymmetric minimum, the four dimensional effective supergravity is described by the following K\"ahler and superpotential  
\begin{equation}
K/M^2_{\rm Pl} = -3 \log\left(T + \overline{T}\right) - K_{\rm cs}\,, \quad W/M^3_{\rm Pl} = W_0 + A e^{-a T}\,,
\end{equation}
where $K_{\rm cs}$ denotes the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the complex structure K\"ahler potential and the dilaton, $W_0$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Gukov-Vafa-Witten flux superpotential~\cite{Gukov:1999ya}. The non-perturbative superpotential contribution $A e^{-aT}$ can be generated by gaugino condensation of D7-branes or Euclidean ED3-branes. Both the flux superpotential $W_0$ and the prefactor of the non-perturbative effect $A$ are functions of complex structure moduli and dilaton, while $a$ is a coefficient which depends on the source of the non-perturbative effect (e.g.~$a=2\pi/N$ for a gaugino condensate from $N$ D7 branes). This setup has a supersymmetric AdS minimum at $D_T W=0.$ To obtain a minimum in the region where the effective field theory is applicable ${\rm Re}(T)\gg 1,$ the flux superpotential has to have hierarchically small values. Such hierarchies can be obtained by stabilising complex structure moduli close to so-called conifold points~\cite{Giddings:2001yu}. This potential is uplifted to a dS minimum by adding some additional source (e.g.~anti D3-branes or matter fields), effectively a standard uplifting term $V_{\text{up}} \simeq \left(\frac{T + \overline{T}}{2}\right)^{-2}$ is added to the potential.\footnote{Different uplfiting mechanisms can give rise to different powers of $T$ appearing in the uplifting potential. For simplicity we just consider one example.} The total scalar potential is given by
\begin{equation}
V/M^4_{\rm Pl} = \frac{e^{K_{\rm cs}}}{6\tau^2}\left(a A^2(3+a\tau)e^{-2a\tau}-3 a A e^{-a\tau}W_0\right)~.
\label{eq:potential_KKLT_tau}
\end{equation}
This then leads to a minimum where supersymmetry is broken and the field value is shifted by a factor $\sim \log\left(M_{\rm Pl}/m_{3/2}\right)$~\cite{LoaizaBrito:2005fa} compared to the AdS supersymmetric minimum. Such a shift influences the ratio between the mass of the field at the minimum of the potential and the height of the barrier. As we see in due course, this allows for multiple oscillations in the tachyonic region of the scalar potential. However, as we will discuss below, parametric resonance is the dominant mechanism for the growth of fluctuations (and not tachyonic oscillations). In our numerical analysis of the KKLT potential we concentrate on the following standard parameter ranges
\begin{equation}
10^{-12} \le W_0 \le 10^{-5}\,,\qquad 1\le A \le 10\,,\qquad 1\le a \le 2\pi~.
\end{equation}
$W_0$ is chosen to be hierarchically smaller than unity to allow for a stabilisation with ${\rm Re}(T)\gg 1$ and the lower bound is chosen such that gravitino mass (and hence the moduli masses) are large enough to safely avoid the cosmological moduli problem. The range for $A$ is chosen that we do not assume any hierarchical suppressions from this contribution. For $a$ we start from the largest possible value and the lower limit still corresponds to a moderate number of D7 branes. The prefactor $e^{K_{\rm cs}}$ which rescales the overall potential is set to unity.

The canonically normalised field $\phi$ of the real part of $T$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\phi/M_{\rm Pl}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\log{\left(T+\bar{T}\right)}\,.
\end{equation}
An example of the potential can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_potential} for  $W_0=10^{-5}$, $A=10$, and $a=2\pi$.

\label{fig:KKLT_potential}
\end{figure}

We would like to begin our discussion with the results of Floquet analyses of the KKLT model with $a=2\pi$, $A=10$, and for two different values of $W_0$: $W_0=10^{-12}$ and $W_0=10^{-5}$. In both cases, the Floquet exponents were calculated in Minkowski space, as a function of the initial field value $\phi(0)\equiv\phi_{\rm initial}$ , essentially corresponding to different amplitudes of oscillation. For $\phi_{\rm initial}$ we assumed values within the following range
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\rm min} < \phi_{\rm initial} \le \phi_{\rm min} + \frac{\phi_{\rm max}-\phi_{\rm inf}}{2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\rm min}$ is the field value at the minimum of the potential, $\phi_{\rm inf}$ is the field value at the inflection point, and $\phi_{\rm max}$ the field value at the local maximum of the potential (see Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_potential}).

The results of our analyses are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:floquet_KKLT} for $W_0=10^{-12}$ (left) and $W_0=10^{-5}$ (right). The Figure shows the real part of the Floquet exponent compared to the Hubble parameter $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}$, where
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm initial}=\frac{1}{M_{\rm Pl}}\sqrt{\frac{V(\phi_{\rm initial})}{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
In both cases, there is a broad instability band with $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$ for $k\lesssim0.5m$. Two other thin and weaker  bands are also visible for $k>0.5m$. They are, however, narrower and also weaker than the first band. In view of these results, we would expect a noticeable amount of growth for modes with comoving wavenumbers $k\lesssim0.5m$ in an expanding universe. To investigate the evolution of the fluctuations in greater detail we performed lattice simulations. The results are presented in the next section.

\subsubsection{Results from lattice simulations}
\label{sec:KKLT_lattice simulations}
Lattice simulations of the evolution of \Kahler modulus in KKLT were performed for the two sets of parameters which were also used to perform the Floquet analyses, i.e. for $W_0=10^{-12}$ and $W_0=10^{-5}$, and in both cases with $a=2\pi$ and $A=10$. The initial field value was considered as a phenomenological parameter which we chose to be half way between the field value at the inflection point $\phi_{\rm inf}$ and the field value at the local maximum of the potential $\phi_{\rm max}$. The initial field velocity $\dot{\phi}_{\rm initial}$ was set to zero. In summary, we used the following initial conditions for the homogeneous background
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\rm initial}=\phi_{\rm min} + \frac{\phi_{\rm max}-\phi_{\rm inf}}{2}\,,\qquad \dot{\phi}_{\rm initial}=0\,,\qquad H_{\rm initial}=\frac{1}{M_{\rm pl}}\sqrt{\frac{V(\phi_{\rm initial})}{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
For the initial conditions of the fluctuations $\delta\phi$ of the \Kahler modulus and their derivatives we used quantum vacuum fluctuations as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:lattice simulations}.


\subsubsection*{KKLT setup with $W_0=10^{-12}$}
\label{sec:KKLT_1e-12}

The simulation of the KKLT model with $W_0=10^{-12}$ was performed in three spatial dimensions in a box with \textit{comoving} volume $V_{\rm lattice} = L^3 \simeq (0.7/H_{\rm initial})^3$ and $256$ lattice points per dimension. The results of the simulation are demonstrated in Figures~\ref{fig:mean_variance_KKLT_1e-12} and \ref{fig:KKLT_spec_1e-12}. 

The left part of Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance_KKLT_1e-12} shows the time evolution of the mean $\langle\phi\rangle$ as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$. The solid black line denotes the field value  at the inflection point of the potential $\phi_{\rm inf}$. One can see that the field crosses the inflection point during the first seven oscillations. Modes for which $k^2<|\partial^2V/\partial\phi^2|$ can be amplified during these tachyonic oscillations. However, as can be seen from the evolution of the variance $\sqrt{\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle}$ on the right part of the plot, both the initial phase of tachyonic preheating, while the field rolls down its potential towards the minimum, and also the subsequent phase of tachyonic oscillations, is not very efficient within this model setup. In fact, the amplitude of the fluctuations starts growing rather when the field falls below the inflection point at $a\sim1.5$. The growth happens due to a parametric (self-)resonance which lasts for many oscillations of $\langle\phi\rangle$. As the amplitude of the background decreases the growth becomes less and less efficient (see Figure~\ref{fig:floquet_KKLT}). At some point (roughly at $a\sim8$) the fluctuations eventually stop growing and are subsequently redshifted due to the expansion. When the variance stops growing the amplitude of the homogeneous component is still about three orders of magnitude larger then the amplitude of the fluctuations. Therefore, although the fluctuations grow by five orders of magnitude the field remains dominated by the homogeneous background and the fluctuations remain linear. 

Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_spec_1e-12} shows the spectrum $k^3|\delta\phi_k|^2/(2\pi^2)$ of the field fluctuations as a function of the \textit{physical} momentum in units of the mass of the \Kahler modulus $m$. The spectrum is shown at different moments in time represented by the scale factor $a$. The blue curve corresponds to the spectrum at $a=2.29$, the green curve at $a=5.76$, the orange curve at $a=8.36$, and the red curve shows the spectrum at the end of the simulation at $a=14.03$. The spectrum forms a peak at $k/a\sim0.2 m$ which initially continues to grow until $a\sim6$, while the position of the peak is continuously moved to lower values of $k/a$ due to the expansion. One can see that the shape of the spectrum remains nearly the same which is exactly what is expected if non-linear interactions between different $k$ modes are absent and the resonance becomes inefficient.

\subsubsection*{KKLT setup with $W_0=10^{-5}$}
\label{sec:KKLT_1e-5}

The situation is different in the scenario with $W_0=10^{-5}$. In fact, as we will shortly discuss in greater detail, the dynamics lead to non-linear interactions between fluctuations and ultimately to the formation of oscillons. The results presented in this part of the section were obtained from a three dimensional lattice simulation of the KKLT model with $W_0=10^{-5}$ and $512$ points per spatial dimension. The simulation was performed in a box with \textit{comoving} volume $V_{\rm lattice} = L^3 \simeq (0.7/H_{\rm initial})^3$.

Let us first discuss the evolution of the mean $\langle\phi\rangle$ and the variance $\sqrt{\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle}$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance_KKLT_1e-5}. The left part of the figure shows $\langle\phi\rangle$ as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$ where the solid black line corresponds to the field value $\phi_{\rm inf}$ at the inflection point of the potential. One can see that within this setup, only the first three oscillations are tachyonic. However, similar to the setup with $W_0=10^{-12}$ the initial phase of tachyonic preheating and also the subsequent tachyonic oscillations are not very efficient as can be seen from the variance on the right part of the plot in Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance_KKLT_1e-5}. An efficient growth of fluctuations does not happen until the amplitude of the homogeneous mode falls below the inflection point. As in the setup with $W_0=10^{-12}$, the dominant mechanism which leads to the growth of fluctuations is a parametric resonance which starts to become efficient at $a\sim1.6$. The amplitude of the fluctuations grows by one order of magnitude during the parametric resonance until non-linear effects start to become important at $a\sim5$. As expected from our Floquet analysis (see Figure~\ref{fig:floquet_KKLT}), the fluctuations grow less within a certain period of expansion than in the KKLT setup with $W_0=10^{-12}$. However, since the amplitude of the initial vacuum fluctuations is now considerably larger, while the amplitudes of the averaged fields are comparable in both cases, the necessary growth for fluctuations to become affected by non-linear effects is significantly smaller. 

The non-linear evolution becomes more apparent when looking at the evolution of the field spectrum at different times. The latter is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_spec_1e-5}. Compared to the results in Section~\ref{sec:KKLT_1e-12} (cf.\ Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_spec_1e-12}), where the shape of the spectrum remains nearly unchanged throughout the evolution of the field, the shape of the spectrum changes significantly. The green curve in Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_spec_1e-5}, for example, shows the spectrum at $a=6.41$. Comparing the spectrum to an earlier time at $a=4.98$ (blue curve) one can clearly see that the peak has extended to a larger range of $k$ modes and developed a smaller, second peak at $a^{-1}k \lesssim2 m$. The other two spectra correspond to times when $a=7.07$ (orange curve) and $a=8.3$ (red curve) at the end of the simulation.

Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_KKLT} shows the spatial energy density distribution normalised to the average energy density $\langle\rho\rangle$ at $a=6.41$ (upper left), $a=7.07$ (upper right), $a=7.7$ (lower left), and $a=8.3$ (lower right). The green surfaces correspond to regions where $\rho = 6\langle\rho\rangle$ and blue surfaces to $\rho = 12\langle\rho\rangle$. As one can see, stable overdensities which are present on each of the figures are produced. These overdensities correspond to localised, large amplitude oscillations in field space, i.e.\ oscillons. By looking carefully at Figure \ref{fig:energydensity_KKLT} one can see that sophisticated dynamics take place: individual oscillons interact among each other, non-spherical and non-ellipsoidal structures emerge and disappear. It also seems that the number of oscillons constantly increases with time. We therefore expect that the phase of oscillon production has not ended by the end of our simulation.

Although the fluctuations become sufficiently large for non-linear effects to become important and inhomogeneities develop in the form of oscillons, we observe that the homogenous mode has not yet (completely) decayed, as can be seen from the mean $\langle\phi\rangle$ in Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance_KKLT_1e-5}. Moreover, an overshooting over the potential barrier into the decompactifying vacuum, which can happen when fluctuations are amplified strong enough (see Ref.~\cite{Antusch:2015nla}) was also not observed in the KKLT setups considered in this paper. 

The production of oscillons and the consequent rich dynamics which is apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_KKLT}, bring us to the last result of this simulation. In Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_GW_1e-5} we present the spectrum of GW $\Omega_{\rm GW, \rm e}(k)$ as a function of the \textit{physical} momentum $k/a$. The different colours correspond to different times at $a=5.72$ (blue), $a=6.41$ (green), $a=7.07$ (orange), and at $a=8.3$ (red). The spectrum develops a characteristic peak structure with peaks at $k/a\lesssim m$ and $k/a\lesssim 2m$ and a broad plateau for $k/a<m$. The peaks are attributable to the oscillon dynamics and their position essentially corresponds to the oscillation frequency of the oscillons (and the next harmonic).\footnote{Note that the position of such a peak would be different in a symmetric potential due to the shift in the resonant frequencies.} Oscillons continue to be constantly formed until the end of our simulation and we therefore expect that the the results we show are not yet the final. Moreover, to have successful reheating the oscillons will have to decay. The decay of the oscillons is an additional source for GW production. However, if we assume that the Universe instantly reheats at the end of our simulation i.e.\ that the whole energy content is immediately converted into radiation, we can calculate the spectrum of the GW as it would be observable today according to Equation\eqref{eq:OmegaGW_today} and \eqref{eq:GW_freq_today} with $a_{\rm e}=a_*$. We find 
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm GW,0}(f_{0, \rm peak}) \sim3\times10^{-11} \,,\quad \textrm{with} \quad f_{0, \rm peak}\sim 10^9\,\textrm{Hz}\,.
\end{equation}
Lower frequencies are in principle also possible. For example, we assumed $e^{K_{\rm cs}}=1$ for the overall rescaling of the potential from the VEV of the complex structure \Kahler potential $K_{\rm cs}$. Values smaller than unitiy would lead to smaller frequencies, since 
\begin{equation}
f \propto \frac{m}{\rho^{1/4}_{\rm e}} \propto \frac{(e^{K_{\rm cs}})^{1/2}}{(e^{K_{\rm cs}})^{1/4}}\propto (e^{K_{\rm cs}})^{1/4}\,.
\end{equation}
We note that, however, decreasing $e^{K_{\rm cs}}$ means also decreasing the magnitude of the initial vacuum fluctuations and that too small values of $e^{K_{\rm cs}}$ could lead to milder dynamics, since the fluctuations would have to grow for a longer period of time for non-perturbative effects to show up. This, in turn leads to less GW production.

\subsection{Blow-up moduli in LVS}
\label{sec:KMI}

Next we dicuss the standard potential for K\"ahler moduli in the Large Volume scenario of moduli stabilisation~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx,Conlon:2005ki} in type IIB string theory. It is realised in so-called Swiss-cheese type Calabi-Yau manifolds where the volume can be written as
\begin{equation}
{V} = \alpha \left(\tau_{\rm b}^{3/2} - \sum_{i=2}^N \alpha_{i} \tau_{{\rm s}, i}^{3/2}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha,$ $\alpha_i$ are numerical constants, $\tau_i$ are the K\"ahler moduli which describe the size of four-cycles in the Calabi-Yau threefold. In the following we will focus on the \textit{small} blow-up cycles $\tau_s$ which are cycles that can shrink to zero size while the volume stays finite -- the holes of the Swiss-cheese. As in KKLT, the complex structure moduli and the dilaton are stabilised using fluxes. The potential for the K\"ahler moduli is generated by $\alpha'-$corrections and non-perturbative corrections. The K\"ahler and superpotential are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
K/M^2_{\rm Pl} &=& - 2 \log\left({V} + \frac{\xi s^{3/2}}{2}\right),\\
W/M^3_{\rm Pl} &=& W_0 + \sum_{i=2}^N A_i e^{-a_i T_{s,i}}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\xi \sim\chi({\rm CY})$ is proportional to the Euler characteristic of the CY considered and parametrises the leading $\alpha'-$corrections, $s=1/g_s$ is the inverse string coupling. $W_0$ is the VEV of the flux superpotential, $A_i$ are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, $a_i$ are constants depending on the non-perturbative effects (e.g.~for gaugino condensation caused by $N$ D7-branes,  $a_i = \frac{2 \pi}{N}$).
In the LVS, the scalar potential for the K\"ahler moduli can be organised in an inverse volume expansion and the leading contributions are given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LVSscalarpotential}
\frac{V_{\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)}}{M^4_{\rm Pl}} = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left[\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{8}{3} \left(\frac{a_i A_i}{\alpha_i}\right)^2 \sqrt{\tau_{s, i}} \,\frac{e^{-2 a_i \tau_{s, i}}}{{V}} -  4 W_0  \,a_i A_i \tau_{s, i} \,\frac{e^{-a_i \tau_{s, i}}}{{V}^2} \right) + \frac{3 \hat{\xi} |W_0|^2}{4 {V}^3}\right] + V_{\text{dS}} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\xi}=\xi/g_s^{3/2},$ $V_{\text{dS}}=D/{V}^\gamma$ ($1\leq\gamma< 3$) is an additional contribution from localised sources where $D$ is fine-tuned to uplift the potential to an approximate Minkowski minimum. In addition, there is an overall rescaling of the entire potential arising from the VEV of the complex structure \Kahler potential $e^{K_{\rm cs}}$, which, unless otherwise stated, we set to unity. The minimum with respect to the small moduli is given by
\begin{equation}
a_i A_i e^{-a_i\tau_i}=\frac{3\alpha\alpha_i}{{V}}\frac{(1-a_i\tau_i)}{(1-4a_i \tau_i)}\sqrt{\tau_i}~.
\end{equation}
In the limit ${V}\to \infty$ this gives
\begin{equation}
a_i \tau_i\approx \log{({V})}~.
\end{equation}
The volume and $D$ are fixed by minimising the potential with respect to the volume and demanding the vanishing of the vacuum energy:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial {V}}=0~,\qquad V=0~.
\end{equation}
This leads to an exponentially large value of the volume in the minimum (in string units)
\begin{equation}
\log{{V}}\approx \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\left(\sum\frac{\alpha_i \alpha}{a_i^{3/2}}\right)^{-1}~.
\end{equation}
The value of $D$ can be determined numerically. The masses for the volume and small moduli in the minimum are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\tau_i}^2&\simeq & M^2_{\rm Pl}\frac{W_0^2 (\log{{V}})^2}{{V}^2}~,\\
m_{{V}}^2&\simeq & M^2_{\rm Pl}\frac{W_0^2 }{{V}^{3}\log{{V}}}~.
\end{eqnarray}
The canonical normalisation of the blow-up modulus is given by $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3{\cal V}}}\tau_2^{3/4}$.

Here we consider the case where one of the blow-up moduli is displaced from the minimum, while keeping all the other fields, in particular the volume at its minimum. 

Notice that in terms of the canonically normalised field $\sigma$ this potential is approximately of the form:

\begin{equation}
V\sim V_0\left(1-\kappa(\sigma) e^{-\alpha \sigma^{4/3}}\right)^2\,,
\end{equation}
so its behaviour is similar to the exponential potentials mentioned before. Notice also that the coefficient of the exponential $\alpha$ is hierarchically large since 
$\alpha\sim \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{V}^{2/3})$. In this case the coefficient $k$ is field-dependent: $k(\sigma) \sim \sigma^{4/3}$. This makes the scalar potential for blow-up modes to behave differently from the potentials for other moduli, such as fibre moduli for which $\alpha\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. In particular the ratio $m/H_{\rm initial}\sim \alpha$ plays an important role in the production of oscillons. For instance in the models of ~\cite{Antusch:2016con} oscillons were found for $m/H_{\rm initial}\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$. Having the coefficient of the exponential $\alpha\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ is natural for potentials of blow-up modes but not for other moduli. 


\subsubsection{Results from lattice simulations}
\label{sec:latticesimulations}
We simulate the evolution of the canonically normalised blow-up modulus $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3{\cal V}}}\tau_2^{3/4}$ in its potential Equation~\eqref{eq:LVSscalarpotential} using the following parameter set: $W_0=A_i=\xi=a_2=1$, $a_1=\pi$, $g_s=0.2$, $\gamma=2$ and $N=10$. The corresponding potential for the field $\sigma$, centered around the minimum of the potential at $\sigma_{\rm min}\simeq0.075\,M_{\rm Pl}$, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:potential} in units of the plateau $V(\sigma \gg \sigma_{\rm min})\equiv V_0 \simeq 1.794\times10^{-12}\,M^4_{\rm Pl}$. The simulation was performed in $3+1$ dimensions with 512 points per spatial dimension in a box with \textit{comoving} volume $V_{\rm lattice}=L^3=(15\pi/m)^3$. The homogeneous field and its derivative were initialised as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm initial} = 0.025\,M_{\rm Pl}\,,\qquad \dot{\sigma}_{\rm initial} = 0\,,\qquad H_{\rm initial} = \frac{1}{M_{\rm pl}}\sqrt{\frac{V(\sigma_{\rm initial})}{3}} = 7.477\times10^{-7} M_{\rm Pl}\,.
\end{equation}
The initial field fluctuations were initialised as quantum vacuum fluctuations (cf.\ Section~\ref{sec:KKLT_lattice simulations}) with an ultraviolet (\textit{comoving}) momentum cutoff at $k_{\rm UV} = m$. The reason for the cutoff is simply to avoid an unphysical contribution to vacuum energy while keeping the resolution benefits of a small lattice spacing.


Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance} shows the mean of the blow-up modulus $\langle\sigma\rangle$ (left) and of the variance $\langle\delta\sigma^2\rangle^{1/2}$ (right) both as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$. The solid black line on the left part of the figure denotes the field value at the inflection point of the potential. From the evolution of $\langle\sigma\rangle$ one can clearly see that the field becomes quickly inhomogeneous within the first 3-4 oscillations. The first few oscillations are tachyonic oscillations i.e.\ oscillations during which the field reaches values beyond the inflection point. As can be seen from the evolution of $\langle\delta\sigma^2\rangle^{1/2}$, on the right part of Figure~\ref{fig:mean_variance}, tachyonic oscillations are the dominant mechanism for the growth of fluctuations. The fluctuations stop growing when non-linear interactions become important.

The next result we want to show is the power spectrum of the fluctuations of $\sigma$. It is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KMI_spec} as a function of the \textit{physical} wavenumber $k/a$. The different colours correspond to different times during the evolution of the field. The blue line shows the spectrum at the end of linear preheating at $a\simeq1.16$. While $a\lesssim1.2$ the fluctuations are constantly amplified due to tachyonic oscillations leading to a peak in the spectrum of $\delta\sigma_k$ for modes with $k/a\lesssim 0.5m$. This growing phase stops as different modes eventually start interacting with each other. The energy carried by the fluctuations is then distributed among different modes leading to a widening of the spectrum towards the UV. The green line shows the spectrum shortly after the beginning of the non-linear regime at $a\simeq1.45$. The other two lines show the spectrum at $a\simeq2.1$ (orange), and at the end of the simulation $a\simeq2.5$ (red).

\label{fig:KMI_spec}
\end{figure}

Another, probably the most interesting, result is the three dimensional distribution of the energy density. It is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_3D} in units of the average energy density $\langle\rho\rangle$, for different moments in time. The green areas correspond to regions with $\rho = 6\,\langle\rho\rangle$ and the blue ones to regions with $\rho = 12\,\langle\rho\rangle$. One can see that the energy density starts fragmenting once non-linear interactions become important ($a\sim1.2$) leading to highly energetic regions. As the Universe expands the dynamics between field fluctuations eventually become less violent, leading to stable, highly energetic, bubbly regions. These bubbly regions represent localised, large amplitude oscillations in field space, i.e.\ oscillons. Although the snapshots shown in Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_3D} are most likely still representing a phase of oscillon formation, one can see that for $a\ge1.78$ there are already bubbles which persist at least until the end of our simulation. 
Compared to the oscillons we found in KKLT (see Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_KKLT}) the oscillons for blow-up moduli look more deformed and also many smaller inhomogeneities are present. Similar to the model studied in \cite{Antusch:2016con}, the tachyonic oscillations lead to violent field dynamics and the homogeneous mode decays quickly into inhomogeneous fluctuations within the first four oscillations of the condensate. 
The fluctuations in KKLT, however, are gradually amplified over many oscillations of the background and over a larger period of expansion. By looking at Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_KKLT} and Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity_3D}, it seems as if inhomogeneities in KKLT are directly generated in the form of oscillons, while the formation of stable oscillons for blow-up moduli happens indirectly through the fragmentation of previously generated, unstable inhomogeneities.
Another impression of the formation and dynamics of oscillons can be seen in two-dimensional simulations where we show snapshots of the evolution of the energy density in Figure~\ref{fig:energydensity}.

The rich dynamics within this blow-up moduli setup lead also to the production of GWs. The stochastic background of GWs produced during the early stage of preheating is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KMI_GW_spec} at different moments in time. After the end of linear preheating $a\gtrsim1.16$ the spectrum forms a flat plateau for $k/a\lesssim m$ which falls off for larger values of $k/a$. The peaky structure in the GW spectrum, which is typically formed in the presence of oscillons, is not visible by the end of our simulation. This, however, does not mean that oscillons do not produce GW. One possible reason for the (yet) absent peaky structure could be that the latter is simply hidden by the stochastic background produced during and shortly after the tachyonic oscillations. This background is produced once during the early stage of preheating and is subsequently redshifted due to the expansion of the Universe. Oscillons, however, are an active source of GW production until they decay. If they live for a sufficiently long period and efficiently produce GWs, the peaky structure in the spectrum of GWs will eventually become visible at some later stage of the evolution. The final spectrum shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KMI_GW_spec} (red curve), is not expected to be the final result since oscillons continue to be produced. If the universe would instantly reheat at that time the frequencies of the plateau (corresponding to $a^{-1}k/m \sim 0.1-1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:KMI_GW_spec}) would lie today at
\begin{equation}
f_0\sim10^8\,\rm{Hz} - 10^9\,\rm{Hz}\,,\qquad \textrm{with}\qquad\Omega_{\rm{GW},0} \sim 10^{-10} - 5\times10^{-10}\,.
\end{equation}
Similar as in KKLT, an overall rescaling of the potential from complex structure moduli which is smaller than unity would also lead to lower frequencies. Altering, other model parameters could in principle also alter the frequencies of the stochastic GW background. Furthermore, the volume modulus being the lightest modulus in this scenario, will at some point start to dominate the energy density of the Universe. This, in turn, leads to an additional period of matter domination and thus pushing not only the frequencies but also $\Omega_{\rm{GW},0}$ to lower values.

\section{Conclusions and open questions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Moduli fields may be the only stringy remnants that survive at low energies and particularly after a period of inflation. It is usually stated that the dilution effect of inflation makes it difficult to test any fundamental theory at scales larger than the inflation scale. Even though this is the case for string theory, moduli fields survive after inflation and can play a crucial role in the relatively late post-inflationary cosmology, improving the probability to allow us to identify cosmological signatures of string theory. 

In this article we studied the potential for moduli fields to produce oscillons during ``moduli preheating'', i.e.\ independent of the particular mechanism that drives inflation. We may summarise our results stating that:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}
Oscillons can be produced from moduli in string theory. For two very well motivated examples of moduli potentials, the overall volume in KKLT and the blow-up moduli in the LVS we find the production of oscillons. 

\item{} The mechanisms producing oscillons in our examples are distinct (parametric resonance and tachyonic oscillations) and lead to subsequently different oscillon dynamics. The shape of the gravitational wave spectra shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KKLT_GW_1e-5} and~\ref{fig:KMI_GW_spec} are different as well, which provides an -- in principle -- observable distinction of the moduli potentials. Compared to previous studies of blow-up moduli preheating, where oscillons were not discussed, we showed that oscillon production can take place via the tachyonic oscillation mechanism. On the contrary, oscillon production in KKLT happens via parametric resonance.  

\item{}
In both cases a distinct stochastic gravitational wave background is produced, which includes contributions from oscillon effects. Contrary to the case of GWs produced during preheating after inflation, the frequency of the GWs can in principle be lower due to the lower energies allowed in moduli potentials. For the examples studied in this paper the frequencies of the GWs are still high. It is an open question whether the relevant scales for other moduli potentials can be such that GWs are produced at frequencies within the reach of current and planned GW detectors such as LIGO \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2014jea} and the Einstein Telescope \cite{ET}. 


\item{}
We also find that oscillon production is model dependent and it depends on the shape and the scale of the potential. In particular, for the considered parameter ranges, we find that no oscillons and sufficiently large inhomogeneities are produced for the volume modulus in the LVS and for fibration moduli in fibred Swiss cheese Calabi-Yau manifolds. Even though scalar  potentials for canonically normalised fibre moduli have the well studied exponential dependence with a flat plateau and an asymmetric structure around the minimum, due to the fact that the coefficient of the exponential is of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$, long-lived oscillons are not produced. Similarly, for the volume modulus for which the scalar potential is a sum of exponentials, with the coefficient of the exponential of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we do not have a production of long-lived oscillons. 

\item{}
The absence of large non-perturbative effects, in particular of oscillons, also implies the absence of ``overshooting effects'' of the modulus field into the decompactification region. This provides additional support for the stability of the metastable KKLT and LVS minima. It will be interesting to study whether overshooting happens in other moduli potentials and what the possible consequences are. 

\end{itemize}

These results are opening several future directions of research; let us mention a few:
\begin{itemize}

\item{} The general case of multi-field potentials needs further study. This will allow us to determine the phenomenological parameter capturing the phase of matter domination from the UV perspective. In particular the displacement of the volume modulus after the blow-up mode relaxes to its own minimum provides one example of such a dilution. Aiming further, one might ask what is the phenomenology of multi-field displacements. Which displacements are compatible with explicit models of string inflation. Concretely, is it possible to keep lighter moduli at their minimum?

\item{} Another aspect a study of multi-field potentials can answer is the coupling to other fields, i.e.~moduli and Standard Model degrees of freedom. This will allow to explicitly study the decay of oscillons. Global string models of chiral matter with inflation such as those recently studied in \cite{Cicoli:2017shd} could be a good laboratory for these investigations.

\item{} Note that in a situation where several moduli are displaced and undergo a significant growth of fluctuations, the possible gravitational radiation produced adds up. It might be worth investigating further on how generic it is that $\mathcal{O}(100)$ moduli are displaced from their minimum and what the generic size of such a gravitational wave signal would be.

\item{} In this article we have focused on potentials for K\"ahler moduli in type~IIB string theory. It will be very interesting to see whether other moduli potentials also support oscillons and which dynamics can be obtained. 
For example, they could lead to oscillons which might even trigger the formation of primordial black holes.

\end{itemize}
Clearly, further studies are needed to fully explore the  implications of oscillons in post-inflationary string cosmology. We hope to return to these exciting phenomenological and theoretical directions in the near future.

\section{On inhomogeneities in other models}
\label{sec:discussion and other models}


Moduli displacement beyond the inflection point around a minimum seems to be fairly generic. Such a displacement makes a phase of tachyonic preheating unavoidable. As explained in Section~\ref{sec:oscillonproduction}, tachyonic preheating leads to the growth of perturbations. Independently of the formation of oscillons, the enhanced spectrum of perturbations leads to the production of a plateau-like gravitational wave spectrum. In this section we discuss this growth of perturbations for other moduli potentials.


\subsection{Volume modulus in LVS}
\label{sec:LVS}

Here we analyse the displacement of the volume modulus of the LVS beyond the inflection point in the scalar potential from Equation~\eqref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}. The structure of the potential for this field is different compared to the potential for the volume modulus in KKLT. In particular we observe that the height of the barrier and the mass of the field at the minimum are always roughly of the same order, with their ratio $\lesssim 20$. As a consequence, after the first tachyonic preheating phase, the field does not cross the inflection point anymore. We also find that parametric resonance is an inefficient mechanism for the growth of fluctuations in this scenario. 

The potential of the canonically normalised volume modulus $\phi$ in the LVS can be expressed as~\cite{Cicoli:2016olq}
\begin{equation}
\frac{V(\phi)}{M^4_{\rm Pl}}=\frac{-3\,P\,W_0^2}{4}e^{-\frac{3\sqrt{3/2}\phi}{M_{\rm Pl}}}\left[2\,\left(\tfrac{3}{2}\right)^{3/4}\,\frac{\phi^{3/2}}{M^{3/2}_{\rm Pl}} -\frac{\hat{\xi}}{P} - 3\,\left(\tfrac{3}{2}\right)^{1/4}\,\frac{\phi_*^{1/2}}{M^{1/2}_{\rm Pl}}\,e^{\frac{\sqrt{3/2}(\phi -\phi_*)}{M_{\rm Pl}}}  \right]\,,
\label{eq:potential_LVS_1}
\end{equation}
where the canonically normalised modulus $\phi$ is related to the volume of the CY manifold by
\begin{equation}
\phi/M_{\rm Pl} = \sqrt{2/3}\log{\mathcal{V}}\,\quad\textrm{and}\quad P=\alpha\sum_{i}\alpha_i a_i^{-3/2}\,,
\end{equation}
and $\phi_*$ is the minimum of the potential satisfying 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat{\xi}}{P} = 2\,\left[\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{3/4}\frac{\phi_*^{3/2}}{M^{3/2}_{\rm Pl}} - \frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\phi_*^{1/2}}{M^{1/2}_{\rm Pl}} \right]\,.
\label{eq:phi_star_xiP_relation}
\end{equation}
By replacing $\hat{\xi}/P$ in Equation~\eqref{eq:potential_LVS_1} with the relation~\eqref{eq:phi_star_xiP_relation} we can express the volume modulus potential in a way that the only free parameters are the value of the minimum $\phi_*$ and the overall normalization of the potential $3\,P\,W_0^2/4$: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{V(\phi)}{M^4_{\rm Pl}}=3\left(\tfrac{3}{2}\right)^{1/4}V_0\,e^{-\frac{3\sqrt{3/2}\phi}{M_{\rm Pl}}}\,\left[\frac{\phi_*^{1/2}}{M^{1/2}_{\rm Pl}}\,e^{\frac{\sqrt{3/2}(\phi -\phi_*)}{M_{\rm Pl}}} - \,\left(\tfrac{2}{3}\right)^{1/2}\,\frac{(\phi^{3/2}-\phi_*^{3/2} )}{M^{3/2}_{\rm Pl}}- \frac{\phi_*^{1/2}}{M^{1/2}_{\rm Pl}}\right]\,,
\label{eq:potential_LVS_2}
\end{equation}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
V_0 \equiv M^4_{\rm Pl}\frac{3\,P\,W_0^2}{4}\,.
\end{equation}
Since $V_0$ is simply an overall rescaling of the potential, it does not have an effect on the evolution of the homogeneous volume modulus. Generic values for the underlying UV parameters lead to a value for $V_0\lesssim  M^4_{\rm Pl}$. For the purpose of this paper we set $V_0=M^4_{\rm Pl}$. By fixing $V_0$, the only free parameter that remains is the value of the vacuum expectation value of the \Kahler modulus $\phi_*$.

An example plot of the potential with $V_0=M_{\rm Pl}^4$ and $\phi_*\simeq28.2 M_{\rm Pl}$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_potential}. The solid black lines correspond to the field value at the local maximum of the potential $\phi_{\rm max}$, the field value at the inflection point of the potential $\phi_{\rm inf}$, and the field value at the minimum of the potential $\phi_*$.

The solid black lines denote the value of the canonically normalised volume modulus at the minimum of the potential $\phi_*$, at the inflection point of the potential $\phi_{\rm inf}$, and at the local maximum of the potential $\phi_{\rm max}$. }
\label{fig:LVS_potential}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Floquet analysis}
\label{sec:floquet_LVS}
For two different realizations of the potential~\eqref{eq:potential_LVS_2}, corresponding to two different choices for $\phi_*$, we performed a Floquet analysis in Minkowski space. We computed the real part of Floquet exponents $\Re[\mu_k]$ as a function of the initial field value of the homogeneous background field $\phi_{\rm initial}$. The results of our analyses are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:floquet_LVS}. The figure shows the real part of the Floquet exponent $|\Re[\mu_k]|$ in units of the Hubble parameter $H_{\rm initial}=1/M_{\rm Pl}\sqrt{V(\phi_{\rm initial})/3}$, for $\phi_* \simeq 5.64 \,M_{\rm Pl}$ (left) and for $\phi_* \simeq 28.2 \,M_{\rm Pl}$  (right).

The Floquet diagram exhibits three distinct instability bands, the strongest and broadest of which at values of $k/m\lesssim0.5$. On the basis of these results, we do not expect a strong growth of fluctuations, since the largest values of $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}$ are of order unity, which in turn means that the growth rate of the fluctuations is comparable to the expansion rate of the Universe. To confirm our expectations, we solved the linearised equations for the fluctuations in an expanding Universe.

The instability bands are represented by the Floquet exponent $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H$ as a function of the initial field value $\phi_{\rm initial}$. The analysis was performed for two different values of $\phi_*$: $\phi_* \simeq 5.64 \,M_{\rm Pl}$ (corresponding to $\mathcal{V}_{\rm min}=10^{3}$) (left) and for $\phi_* \simeq 28.2 \,M_{\rm Pl}$ (corresponding to $\mathcal{V}_{\rm min}=10^{15}$) (right).}
\label{fig:floquet_LVS}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Homogeneous field evolution and linear perturbations}
\label{sec:linear_LVS}
We computed the evolution of the fluctuations for the potential~\ref{fig:LVS_potential} with $\phi_* \simeq 28.2\,M_{\rm Pl}$ by numerically solving Equation~\eqref{eq:perturbationEOM} with initial conditions for the fluctuations given by Equation~\eqref{eq:IC_fluctuations}. At the same time we solved Equation~\eqref{eq:homogeneousEOM} for the homogeneous component $\phi(t)$. We used the following initial conditions for the homogenous background field $\phi$, its velocity $\dot{\phi}$ and the Hubble parameter $H$:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\rm initial} \simeq 28.61\,M_{\rm Pl}\,, \qquad\dot{\phi}_{\rm initial} = 0\,\,,\qquad H_{\rm initial}=\sqrt{\frac{V(\phi_{\rm initial})}{3\,M^2_{\rm Pl}}} \simeq 1.39\times10^{-23}\,M_{\rm Pl}\,.
\end{equation}

The numerical results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_spec} and~\ref{fig:LVS_hom_var}. Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_spec} shows the spectrum of the fluctuations of the canonically normalised volume modulus as a function of the \textit{comoving} momentum $k$ at different moments in time: the initial spectrum (blue), before the first oscillation of $\phi$ at the end of tachyonic preheating (green), after eight oscillations (orange), and after 47 oscillations (red). 
Initially we have a phase of tachyonic preheating during which the infrared tail is amplified by roughly one order of magnitude. The phase of tachyonic preheating is subsequently followed by a weak self-resonance during which modes with $k\sim 0.5 m$ are amplified. The amplification of these modes leads to a tiny peak in the final spectrum shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_spec}.

Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_hom_var} shows the evolution homogeneous field $\phi(t)$ (right) and the evolution of the variance $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle$ (left) as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$. The variance was calculated from the spectrum of the linear perturbations according to
\begin{equation}
\langle \delta\phi^2\rangle = \int d\log k\,\frac{k^3}{2\pi^2}|\delta\phi_k|^2 = \int dk\,\frac{k^2}{2\pi^2}|\delta\phi_k|^2\,.
\end{equation}
One can see that the variance decreases continuously since no significant amplification of the perturbations takes place. However, since the homogeneous field $\phi(t)$ is damped and its amplitude of oscillation decreases as well, a net growth of fluctuations with respect to the amplitude of $\phi(t)$ is in principle possible. In order to estimate the relative growth of fluctuations with respect to the amplitude of the field we can consider the following quantity
\begin{equation}
\gamma(t) \equiv \frac{\sqrt{\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle(t)}}{\Phi(t)}\frac{\Phi(0)}{\sqrt{\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle_{\rm vac}}}\,,
\label{eq:def_gamma}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(t)$ is the envelope of $\sqrt{[\phi(t)-\phi_*]^2}$ and $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle_{\rm vac}$ is the variance obtained from the initial vacuum spectrum. As long as the evolution of the fluctuations is linear, $\gamma(t)$ is a measure for the growth of the fluctuations relative to the amplitude of the field which is independent of the absolute value of the vacuum fluctuations (i.e.\ independent of $V_0$).

The left part of Figure~\ref{fig:LVS_gamma} shows $\sqrt{[\phi(t)-\phi_*]^2}$ (blue) and $\Phi(t)$ (red) both as a function of $a(t)$, where $\Phi(t)$ was calculated at times at which $\dot{\phi}=0$. The right part of the Figure shows the evolution of $\gamma(t)$. One can see that in the case of the volume modulus the fluctuations grow only by a factor of $\sim3.5$ relative to the field amplitude and that the relative growth rate decreases with time. Provided that initially the fluctuations are small compared to the amplitude of homogeneous field $\phi(t)$, this means that always $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle \ll\Phi(t)$. For the considered parameter ranges, we do not find significant inhomogeneities or non-perturbative effects. In turn, the absence of significant inhomogeneities implies that GWs are expected to be only marginally produced. 


The mild and perturbative dynamics prevent the field from overshooting over the potential barrier into the decompactification minimum, thus supporting the stability of the LVS minimum.

\subsection{Fibre inflation}
\label{sec:fibre inflation}


The last example we want to consider is \textit{fibre inflation}~\cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Burgess:2016owb}. This is a model of large field inflation which gives rise to a tensor-to-scalar ratio in the experimentally accessible window $r \in (10^{-3}, 10^{-2})$~\cite{Cicoli:2016chb}.\footnote{A consistent string embedding of fibre inflation with an explicit orientifolded Calabi-Yau manifold and brane setup can be found in~\cite{Cicoli:2016xae}.} The inflaton corresponds to a K\"ahler modulus describing the `fibre' volume in a fibred Calabi-Yau manifold of Swiss-cheese type. In its simplest version the scalar potential of fibre inflation in terms of the canonically normalised field $\phi$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = V_0 \left(c_0 + c_1 e^{-\frac{k \phi}{2}} + c_2 e^{- 2 k \phi} + \epsilon e^{k \phi}\right)\,,
\label{eq:fibre_potential}
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ and $\epsilon$ are coefficients that depend on the underlying parameters of the compactification, and can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fibrecoefficients}
c_0 = 3 - \epsilon \,,\quad c_1 = -4 \left(1+ \frac{\epsilon}{6}\right)\,, \quad c_2 = \left(1 + \frac{2 \epsilon}{3}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
$\epsilon$ is naturally small (it is proportional to $g_s^4$), preserving the flatness of the inflationary plateau.
Similarly, $V_0$ is set by the overall stabilisation of the Calabi-Yau volume and hence hierarchically smaller than unity. The coefficients are adjusted such that $V(0) = 0$. $k = 2/\sqrt{3}$ is a coefficient that arises from the canonical normalization of the field $\phi$.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Floquet analysis}
\label{sec:floquet_fibre}

For the fibre potential~\eqref{eq:fibre_potential} we performed two different Floquet analyses in Minkowski space. In the first analysis we kept the initial field value (i.e.\ the amplitude of oscillation) $\phi_{\rm initial}$ constant and computed the Floquet exponents  for different values of $\epsilon$ ranging from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$. A second analysis was  performed with a fixed value of $\epsilon$ where the Floquet exponents were computed as a function of $\phi_{\rm initial}$. 

The results of the analyses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:floquet}. The left part of the figure shows the Floquet exponents $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}$ as a function of $k/m$ and $\epsilon$. On the right we show $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}$ as a function of the amplitude of oscillation $\phi_{\rm initial}$ for a fixed $\epsilon = 10^{-7}$. The Hubble parameter is calculated according to
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm initial}=\sqrt{\frac{V(\phi_{\rm initial})}{3\,M^2_{\rm Pl}}}\,.
\end{equation}
For the maximum $\phi_{\rm initial}$ we chose the value at the end of slow-roll inflation, when\footnote{$\varepsilon_\phi \equiv M^2_{\rm Pl}/2(V'(\phi)/V)^2\simeq1$ for $\phi \simeq 0.91$ holds for all values of $\epsilon$ between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$. For larger values of $\epsilon$ the potential becomes steeper. Hence, within our Floquet anlyses the field lies always outside the slow-roll regime.} $\varepsilon_\phi \equiv M^2_{\rm Pl}/2(V'(\phi)/V)^2\simeq1$, $\phi \simeq 0.91\ge\phi_{\rm initial}$.

One can see that the Floquet exponents are always small compared to the expansion rate of the Universe, since $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial}\lesssim0.4$ for all values of $k$, $\phi_{\rm initial}$ and $\epsilon$. Therefore the fluctuations are not expected to grow significantly throughout the evolution of the field in an expanding Universe. In order to confirm this we compute the evolution of the perturbations $\delta\phi_k$ in an expanding Universe by solving the linearised equations of motion~\eqref{eq:perturbationEOM}.

\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{fibre_mu_eps.pdf}}

One can see that in none of the cases $|\Re[\mu_k]|/H_{\rm initial} > 0.4$ which is a strong indication that no significant growth of fluctuations occurs in an expanding Universe.}
\label{fig:floquet}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Homogeneous field evolution and linear perturbations}
\label{sec:linear_fibre}
We solved the equation of motion for the homogeneous field $\phi(t)$ Equation~\eqref{eq:homogeneousEOM} and at the same time the equations for the perturbations of the field Equation~\eqref{eq:perturbationEOM}. The initial conditions for the homogeneous field and the Hubble parameter are set to\footnote{We also checked explicitly that the results do not change significantly when replacing the initial field velocity with the slow-roll velocity $\dot{\phi}_{\rm initial} = -V'(\phi_{\rm initial})/(3\,H_{\rm initial})$.}
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\rm initial} = 0.8\,M_{\rm Pl}\,,\qquad\dot{\phi}_{\rm initial} = 0\,\,,\qquad H_{\rm initial}=\sqrt{\frac{V(\phi_{\rm initial})}{3\,M^2_{\rm Pl}}} \simeq 0.46\,M_{\rm Pl}\,.
\end{equation}
The fluctuations $\delta\phi_k$ are initialised as vacuum fluctuations according to Equation~\eqref{eq:IC_fluctuations}.

The results for the homogeneous field evolution and for the spectrum of the perturbations are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fld_and_specs}. The left part of the figure shows the homogeneous field $\phi(t)$ as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$. One can clearly see that the amplitude of the field is strongly damped due to the expansion. On the right part of the figure the spectrum $\frac{k^3}{2\pi^2}|\phi_k|^2$ is shown in dependence of the \textit{comoving} wavenumber $k$ at different moments in time: the initial spectrum (blue), after the first oscillation of $\phi$ (green), after four oscillations (orange), and after eight oscillations (red). One can clearly see that none of the modes is significantly excited, as already expected from the Floquet analysis. The spectrum is redshifted due to the expansion and the field can be considered to stay practically homogeneous.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

Testing physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) of particle physics is extremely challenging, especially for energies much higher than the TeV scale. Proton decay, tensor modes from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and possibly cosmic strings are  some of the very few potential signatures that can be searched in order to explore very high energies, like those of the Grand Unification scale, which are beyond reach of collider experiments, even in the long future. Gravitational waves, especially at ultra high frequencies, may provide a new tool to explore physics beyond the Standard Model at very high energies, as well as the early stages of the universe and it is worth exploring this potential.\vspace{0.1cm}


The Cosmic Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) is an irreducible background of Gravitational Waves (GWs), sourced by the interactions of the constituents of a plasma in thermal equilibrium. Its shape was computed in~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa,Ghiglieri:2020mhm} to leading-log and full leading order, respectively, for the Standard Model (SM) particles and interactions. This approach was later generalised in~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} to the spectrum of an arbitrary weakly coupled renormalisable gauge theory with couplings to scalars and fermions. In these papers, it was shown that the shape of the CGWB is determined mostly by gauge interactions at the hottest moment of the evolution of the plasma. In other words, the CGWB carries a snapshot of how the Universe looked like right after reheating. \vspace{0.1cm}

The shape of the CGWB is therefore a direct probe for physics much further than the last scattering surface, which bounds electromagnetic astronomy. Due to its characteristic frequency, around $80$ GHz, the CGWB is an example of an ultra high frequency source of GWs, which are attracting the attention of a growing community of both theorists and experimentalists~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq}. It is becoming increasingly clear that early Universe processes release backgrounds at these high frequencies, and that their potential detection provides a window for the direct study of high energy physics that is not achievable through electromagnetic astronomy or collider physics. \vspace{0.1cm}

In this paper, we study the general implications of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) on the spectrum of the CGWB. 
In particular, we study modifications of the CGWB due to the presence of general hidden sectors\footnote{
We focus on hidden -thermally independent- sectors 
defined as  particles coupled to the visible sector only through couplings with interaction rate satisfying $\Gamma \ll H$, so that they cannot reach equilibrium. Examples are gravitational and other non-renormalisable couplings to the SM  that generically appear in string theory.}.
In standard cosmology with inflation followed by radiation and matter domination,
we find that the sector dominating the energy density at reheating determines the peak of the CGWB spectrum.
However, despite the presence of hidden sectors,
it turns out that generically the SM dominates the spectrum of the CGWB, thereby generalising the findings of~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}.  \vspace{0.1cm}


Further, we explore non-standard cosmologies and observe that, if there are periods where the background energy density is governed by a fluid with a stiff equation of state $\omega >1/3$ such as in kination domination,
then the contributions from BSM physics dominates. We show that the shape of the CGWB can carry information about the interactions among hidden sectors, and we manage to rule out part of a parameter space described in terms of the number of e-folds of kination and maximum temperature.  \vspace{0.1cm}

More concretely, we focus on GWs sourced by a thermal bath in the early Universe due to particle collisions.
The amount of produced GWs is characterised by a fraction of the total energy density $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}}, 0}(f)$.\footnote{We use the subscript $``0"$ to indicate that quantities are evaluated in the present Universe.}
When considering only the SM, the GW spectrum $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}}, 0}(f)$ features a peak frequency around $80 \, $ GHz \footnote{Since the frequency tracks the CMB case and falls in the microwave range reference~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} called this radiation CGMB. We prefer to slightly deviate from this notation since we will explore other frequency ranges and chose the more general CGWB. } and an amplitude which is linear in the reheating temperature $T_{\text{max}}$, corresponding to the maximum temperature the thermal bath has experienced.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SMcase}, we report\footnote{We do not consider additional processes becoming relevant at very high temperatures~\cite{Ghiglieri:2022rfp}.} the GW spectrum obtained with $T_{\text{max}}=10^{-4}M_{P}, \, T_{\text{max}}=10^{-6}M_{P}$ and $T_{\text{max}}=10^{-8}M_{P}$, assuming that the entire particle content is attributed to the SM.
At the peak frequency, the energy density $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0} (f_{\rm peak}) \sim 10^{-11}$ is well below the BBN bound $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0}^{\text{\tiny{BBN}}} \sim 10^{-6}$.
It has already been shown in~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} that, for a given $T_{\text{max}}$, it is challenging to enhance the amplitude of such a peak, at least in weakly coupled extensions of the SM with a standard cosmological history: despite the enhanced GW emission from additional interactions, the spectrum also experiences more red-shifting due to the emission happening earlier.
Indeed, since $H^2\sim g_{\tiny{*}} T^4$, for fixed $T$ the Hubble scale of emission is minimised by the SM because any hypothetical extension of the SM involves additional degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Executive summary}\label{sec:ExecutiveSummary}

This work investigates the general potential for the CGWB to explore physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. 
We study general extensions of the SM including an arbitrary number of hidden sectors. In this vein, we write the energy density $\rho$ as $\rho = \sum_i \rho^{(i)}$ where $\rho^{(i)}$ corresponds to the energy density of the \textit{i}$^\text{th}$ sector.
In principle, each sector can have a different temperature $T_i$ as long as the constraint on dark radiation at BBN is satisfied.
The thermal bath in each decoupled sector produces a different GW background with energy density $\rho^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny{GW}}}$.
The position of the peak in each spectrum is determined by the temperature of the corresponding sector. Close to this peak, the time-dependent part of $\rho^{(i)}_{\tti{GW}}$ produced per e-fold in the sector $i$ at time $t$ is approximated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fraction}
    \frac{d}{d\log a}\lr{\frac{d \rho^{(i)}_{\tti{GW}}}{d \log k}} \sim T_i \; \frac{\rho^{(i)}a(t)^4}{\sqrt{\dof{tot}}}F(\hk)\,.
\end{equation}
Here, $a$ is the scale factor, $k$ the physical wavenumber of the GW, $g_{*, \tiny{tot}}$ the effective number of massless degrees of freedom and $F(\hat{k}_i)$ a function of $\hat{k}_i\equiv k/T_i$ which encodes the interactions that source GWs.

There are two main lessons to learn from Eq.~\eqref{eq:fraction}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assuming  that $g_{*, \tiny{tot}}=\text{const.}$ 
    Then, because $\rho^{(i)}\sim a(t)^{-4}$ and both $k$ and $T$ redshift as $1/a$, the only non-constant term in the right hand side is $T_i$. 
    Therefore, the amount of GWs released is larger at early times, when the sector was hotter, and these contributions dominate the GW energy density, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:scenario1}. 
    In other words, the CGWB carries an imprint of the Universe during its hottest phase and can be used as a thermometer of the hot big bang~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}.
    \item Once hidden sectors are taken into account, several spectra of the schematic type shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SMcase} for the SM overlie each other, thereby potentially resulting in novel shapes. 
    From Eq.~\eqref{eq:fraction}, we note that the dominant contribution to GWs at every time will be sourced by the sector dominating the energy density at that time. 
\end{itemize}
Putting both arguments together, because for every sector the amplitude of the CGWB is dominated at early times, the shape of the CGWB will be dictated by the sector carrying the most energy density after reheating.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{"scenario_standard".pdf}  
\caption{

As explained below Eq.~\eqref{eq:fraction}, and illustrated by the red and yellow line, GWs sourced later, when the bath is colder, are sub-dominant. 
}
\label{fig:scenario1}
\end{figure}

Throughout the paper, we study how this shape is modified in the presence of a hot hidden sector in the early Universe.
In order for such a scenario to be compatible with the BBN bound, the hidden sector energy density $\rho_h$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BBNBound} 
\text{BBN bound: }\quad\rho_h \lesssim  \frac{\pi^2}{30}\times \frac{7}{4}\Delta N_{\text{\tiny{eff}}} T_{\rm vis}^4 \,,
\end{equation}
when the temperature of the visible sector is $T_{\rm vis}\sim 1 $ MeV. 
The latest Planck results~\cite{Planck:2018vyg} constrain $\Delta N_{\text{\tiny{eff}}} \leq 0.30$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which is a tight constraint on the existence of hot hidden sectors at BBN. 
A way to reconcile an early hot sector meeting Eq.~\eqref{eq:BBNBound} is through fast dilution of the energy density. 
This happens for instance if the relevant sector undergoes a phase with a stiff equation of state $\omega >1/3$, such as a period of kination, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:scenario3}.
We will study this example more thoroughly in Sec.~\ref{sec:kination}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{"scenario_kination".pdf}
\caption{Evolution of the energy densities in the kination scenario as a function of redshift. Solid lines represent massless degrees of freedom, and dashed lines the respective dominant contribution to $\Omega^{(i)}_{\tti{GW},0}$. The figure illustrates a hidden sector with a variable equation of state. During the period $\log(z/z_{\tti{BBN}})\in (5,35)$, the hidden sector undergoes kination, $\rho(t) \sim a(t)^{-6}$. For a sufficiently long kination era, GWs from the hidden sector can saturate the BBN bound while the energy content in massless degrees of freedom avoids it.}
\label{fig:scenario3}
\end{figure}


To summarise, our main goal is a model independent study of the CGWB, establishing the robustness of the SM spectrum, even in the presence of general BSM physics, and exploring variations from it. We consider alternative cosmological histories  and perform a detailed analysis of such largely unexplored scenarios  by putting constraints on their parameters, such as reheating temperatures or the duration of kination eras. We find regions of parameter space saturating the BBN bound by obtaining $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}}, 0} \sim 10^{-6}$ at the peak of the spectrum and regions which are already ruled out by the BBN bound.

\subsection*{Plan for the paper}

This paper is organised as follows.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:CGWBThermalPlasma},
we review the production of GWs from weakly coupled thermal plasmas, and their subsequent propagation through spacetime. 
We emphasise the effects of hidden sectors, and compute the shape of the CGWB sourced by each sector. 
For each of these spectra, we analyse the behaviour of the amplitude and peak frequency, thereby concluding that the behaviour of the total amplitude is controlled by the sector dominating the energy density after reheating.
We also show how our framework reproduces the \textit{standard scenario} considered in~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa,Ghiglieri:2020mhm,Ringwald:2020ist}, in which the energy density of the Universe is dominated by the SM (or a minimal extension thereof) and the equation of state of the background is that of radiation.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:results},
we illustrate two ways in which a hidden sector may have dominated the energy density of the early Universe while respecting the BBN bound in Eq.~\eqref{eq:BBNBound}. These processes consist of injection of entropy through annihilation of massive degrees of freedom, or a stiff equation of state, and we will refer to them as the \textit{entropy scenario} and \textit{kination scenario}, respectively. We argue that the latter scenario can yield substantially different results, including a boost in the amplitude.
We summarise our results in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{CGWB from BSM Theories}\label{sec:CGWBThermalPlasma}

\subsection{CGWB from a thermal plasma}

GWs travel essentially freely after emission and, thus, carry unaltered information about processes that sourced them. 
For this reason, the CGWB constitutes a valuable target for directly observing pre-CMB physics. 
This section concerns the propagation of GWs from their time of emission to today. 
Specifically, we derive an expression for the fractional energy density $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW},0}}(f)$ in terms of the frequency today.\\

The GW energy density $\rho_{\text{\tiny GW}}^{(i)}$ in the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector is governed by the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cosmoprod}
 \dfrac{1}{a^{4}}\frac{d}{d t} \left(a^4 \rho_{\text{\tiny GW}}^{(i)}\right)=   (\partial_t+4H(t))\rho_\text{\tiny{GW}}^{(i)}=\frac{4T_i^4}{M_{P}^2}\int{\frac{\der^3 \textbf{k}}{(2\pi) ^3} \heta_i (T_i, \hk_i)} \,,
\end{equation}
where $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $H(t) = \dot{a}(t)/a(t)$ is the Hubble parameter, $T_i$ is the temperature of the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector and the right hand side plays the role of a source term.\footnote{We assume that the independent radiation sectors are either in thermal equilibrium or completely decoupled (thus not sourcing GWs). The only out of equilibrium process relevant for our purposes is that of fields becoming massive (and eventually annihilated), which can be considered adiabatic if $\Gamma \gg H$~\cite{Bernstein:1988bw}, with $\Gamma$ the effective interaction rate with the plasma.} 
The term $\eta_i(T_i, \hat{k}_i)$ encodes the effects of GW emission from a thermal plasma. 
While it is the sum of various components (see Appendix~\ref{sec: integrate omega} for the details), in our scenarios the dominant contribution comes from the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) piece\footnote{We work sufficiently close to the peak of this function, $\hk \sim 4$, where the description in terms of quasiparticles is valid~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa,Ghiglieri:2020mhm,Ringwald:2020ist}.} $\eta_{\text{\tiny{HTL}}}$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta_HTL}
    \heta_\text{\tiny{HTL}}=  \sum_n\mathcal{N}_n\hat{m}_n^2(T)\xi_n(\hk) \,,\qquad \xi_n(\hk)=\frac{\hk}{16\pi (e^{\hk}-1)}  \log \left ( 1+\frac{4\hk^2}{\hat{m}_n^2} \right ) \,.
\end{equation}
Here we consider a theory with $n=1,\ldots,N_g$ gauge groups, gauge couplings $g_n(T)$, $\mathcal{N}_n$-dimensional Lie algebras and thermal masses $m_n(T)^2 = T^2 \, \hat{m}_n(T)^2 \propto T^2 \, g_n(T)$, whose expressions are given explicitly in Appendix~\ref{sec: integrate omega}. 
Also, we work under the assumption that $\rho_\text{\tiny GW}$ is always a sub-leading component of the energy density of the Universe.

We can find the total energy density in GWs today $\rho_{\text{\tiny GW},0}$ by integrating Eq.~\eqref{eq:cosmoprod}.
Assuming that the production of GWs starts at time $t_p$ and finishes at $t_{\rm end}$, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rhoia}
\rho_{\text{\tiny GW}}^{(i)}(t_{\rm end}) = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\pi^2M_{P}}\, \dfrac{1}{a^4_{\rm end}}\int_{t_{\rm end}}^{t_p}{\dif a \/\ T_i^7 a(t)^3 \int d\log k \, \frac{\hk_i^3\heta_i(T_i,\hk_i)}{\sqrt{\rho}} }\,,
\end{equation}
where we defined $a_{\rm end} \equiv a(t_{\rm end})$, $a_p \equiv a(t_p)$ and $a_0 \equiv a(t_0)$.
The total energy density of the Universe $\rho$ reads in terms of relativistic\footnote{Note that GW production occurs before BBN, where we assume that the Universe is radiation dominated.} degrees of freedom $g_{*,j}$
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{\pi^2}{30}\sum_j g_{*,j}\, T_j^4\, .
\end{equation}
From Eq.~\eqref{eq:rhoia} one can easily find the energy density in GWs today (in the $i^{th}$ sector), red-shifting the result by a factor $(a_{\rm end}/a_0)^4$.

Stochastic GW backgrounds are characterised by the energy density fraction per logarithmic frequency interval~\cite{Caprini:2018mtu} which can be computed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SGWB0} 
h^2 \Omega^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny GW},0} = \frac{h^2}{\rho_c} \left(\frac{a_{\rm end}}{a_0}\right)^4 \left.\frac{d \rho^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny GW}}}{d \log k}\right|_{\rm end} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_c$ is the critical density and $H_0 = 100 \, h \, \text{Km} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ is the Hubble constant today.
Lastly, combining Eq.~\eqref{eq:rhoia} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:SGWB0} as well as using the current radiation energy density~\cite{Fixsen:2009ug}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\gamma, 0}=\frac{\rho_{\gamma,0}}{\rho_{c}}=\frac{\pi^2}{15}\frac{T_{{\rm vis},0}^4}{\rho_{c}}=2.4728(21)\times 10^{-5}/h^2\, ,
\end{equation}
we arrive at our final expression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ampl}
    \dfrac{ \Omega^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0}}{ \Omega_{\gamma,0}}=  \frac{\lambda}{M_{P}}  \frac{1}{(a_0 T_{{\rm vis},0})^4}
    \int_{t_p}^{t_{\rm end}}\dif a \, \frac{(aT_i)^5}{a^2}\, \dfrac{T_{i}^{2}}{\sqrt{\rho}} \, \hk_i^3 \heta_i (T_i, \hk_i ) \,,
\end{equation}
in terms of
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\dfrac{30 \sqrt{3}}{\pi^{4}}\, , \qquad \dfrac{\sqrt{\rho}}{T_{i}^{2}}=\sqrt{\dfrac{\pi^{2}}{30}\sum_j{g_{*,j}\left ( \frac{T_j}{T_{i}} \right )^4}}\, .
\end{equation}

This is the energy density of GWs emitted by each independent sector.
In the remainder of this paper,
we use Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampl} to engineer scenarios with phenomenologically appealing features for $\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW},0}}(f)$ by synergising hidden sectors with non-conventional cosmological phases.
But before delving into the specifics,
let us extract universal properties from the above results.



\subsection{General features}\label{sec:generalresults}

\subsubsection{Spectrum}

We begin by exploring the implications of Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampl} on the GW spectrum.
To this end,
let us consider a phase in the history of the Universe in which the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $g_{*,i}$ in the \textit{i}$^{th}$ sector is constant. 
Although GWs can be emitted for varying $g_{*,j}$, such contributions come on top of the results reported here, which in this sense can be regarded as a lower bound on the production of GWs.
However, as we discuss in Appendix~\ref{sec: integrate omega}, it is this contribution that features the qualitative aspects of the spectrum.

Let us write $\tem{i}{r}\equiv T_i(t^{r})$, $a_{r}\equiv a(t^{r})$, where $t^r$ indicates the time of reheating. Then, the energy densities of GWs in the sector $i$ emmitted after reheating is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:OmegaSector}
\dfrac{\Omega^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0}}{ \Omega_{\gamma,0}}\simeq  \lambda\,  \left (\frac{a_{r}}{a_0}\frac{\tem{i}{r}}{\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}\right)^4
     \frac{\lr{\tem{i}{r}-T_i(t^f)}}{M_{P}} \dfrac{\left (\tem{i}{r}\right )^{2}}{\sqrt{\rho^{(r)}}}  \hk_i^3 \heta_i \left (\tem{i}{r}, \hk_i \right )  \,.
\end{equation}

This follows from the integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampl} over a phase in which the effective degrees of freedom are constant, and ignoring the logarithmic dependence of the couplings on $T$,
i.e., by treating $\eta$ as approximately constant.
The time $t^f$ indicates the moment in which effective degrees of freedom cease to be constant, an example being some of the fields becoming massive. 
Notice, however, that in general $\tem{i}{r}\gg T_i(t^f)$ so we can safely neglect the latter.
The total energy density of GWs produced by the thermal plasma during this phase amounts to
\begin{align}\label{eq:mastf}
\dfrac{ \Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0}}{\Omega_{\gamma,0} } \simeq \lambda\,
    \sum_{i=1}^{N}{ \frac{\tem{i}{r}}{M_{P}}  \left (\frac{\tem{i}{r}}{\tem{vis}{0}}\frac{a_{r}}{a_0}\right)^4
     \dfrac{\left (\tem{i}{r}\right )^{2}}{\sqrt{\rho^{(r)}}} \, \hk_i^3 \heta_i \left (\tem{i}{r},\hk_i \right )} \,,
\end{align}
where $N$ denotes the number of thermally independent sectors.\\
A few comments are in order.
For the case where there is only one sector (the SM or some extension at high temperatures) with fixed equation of state, the quantities $a_r\tem{i}{r}/(a_0\tem{vis}{0})$ and $k/T$ are fixed by the conservation of co-moving entropy, up to high energy degrees of freedom (see Sec.~\ref{sec:entropy}). 
In addition, $T^2/\sqrt\rho$ is temperature-independent, and so is $\eta$ by assumption.
The total contribution is therefore linear in ${T}/{M_{P}}$, which implies that the CGWB could be used as a thermometer of the Hot Big Bang~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}. 

Furthermore, as anticipated in Sec.~\ref{sec:Intro}, it also follows that the dominant contribution is sourced at the time where the plasma was the hottest (hence the superscript $r$, denoting \textit{reheating}, since this moment should happen after reaching thermal equilibrium, right after reheating).
We henceforth focus in such regime, commenting further in additional contributions to the CGWB in Appendix~\ref{sec: integrate omega}.
The rest of the section is devoted to the study of Eq.~\eqref{eq:OmegaSector}.


\subsubsection{Peak amplitude}

We observe in Fig.~\ref{fig:SMcase} that the shape of the SM contribution to Eq.~\eqref{eq:mastf} has a global maximum. This is true universally for the GW spectrum produced in each sector,\footnote{At least in weakly coupled extensions. Similar results at strong coupling have been studied in~\cite{Castells-Tiestos:2022qgu}.} as we will show momentarily.
In this subsection,
we study how the position and maximum amplitude of this peak, which are the phenomenologically most interesting aspects of the spectrum, change within the different scenarios.
In order to obtain an analytic understanding, we restrict ourselves to consider the leading-log HTL part~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa,Ghiglieri:2020mhm,Ringwald:2020ist}
of Eq.~\eqref{eq:eta_HTL}.\\

Let us define the objects
\begin{equation}
    F(\hk)=\lambda\, h^2\Omega_{\gamma,0}\hk^3\xi(\hk) \, ,\qquad K_i = \sum_{n(i)} \mathcal{N}_n\hat{m}^2_n(T) \,,
\end{equation}

where $\xi$, as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:eta_HTL}, depends only logarithmically on the field content of the scenario under consideration. Neglecting this dependence allows us to extract general features about the position of the peak and its amplitude.
Further, $K_{i}$ is a sum over all coupled gauge fields within the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector.
Then we can express the amplitude of an arbitrary coupled sector in terms of $F(\hk)$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq: omega f}
    h^2\Omega^{(i)}_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0} \sim \left(\frac{a_{r}}{a_0} \frac{\tem{i}{r}}{\tem{vis}{0}}\right)^4 \frac{\tem{i}{r}}{M_{P}} \frac{\left(\tem{i}{r}\right)^2}{\sqrt{\rho^{(r)}}}\,  K_i\, F(\hk_i) \,.
\end{equation}
This expression formalises the schematic form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:fraction}. 
Indeed, $T_i^2/\sqrt{\rho}$ counts the degrees of freedom that dominate the energy density, and $K_iT_i^4$ is proportional to the energy density of the gauge fields in the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector, which source the HTL contribution.\\

The result in Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega f} will play a vital role in Sec.~\ref{sec:results} where we aim at boosting the spectrum in order to find larger signatures from GWs.
To this end,
we will consider cosmological periods with equations of state $\omega>1/3$, which increase the ratio $a_{r}\tem{i}{r}/(a_0\tem{vis}{0})$ appearing in Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega f}. Physically, these scenarios lead to larger energy densities than the standard scenario, thereby increasing the GW signal.

\subsubsection{Peak frequency}

The amplitude in Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega f} depends on the GW frequency $f$ through the quantity $\hk_i\equiv k/T_i$, which is evaluated at the time of production. To relate the latter to the frequency today, we use $k(t)a(t)=\rm const.$ to write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:freqPeak} 
    \hk_i=  \frac{2 \pi f}{T_i(t)} \frac{a_0}{a(t)} \quad \Rightarrow\quad \frac{f}{\tem{vis}{0}}\sim \frac{a_{r}}{a_0} \frac{\tem{i}{r}}{\tem{vis}{0}}\, .
\end{equation}
The position of the peak in Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega f} is determined by $F(\hk)$ at around $\hk \simeq 4.2$~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}.\footnote{Small variations to this number arise from the logarithmic dependence of the HTL on the field content, and from additional leading order corrections.} 
Let us make contact with the standard scenario, where the ratio 
$a_{r}\tem{i}{r}/(a_0\tem{\text{vis}}{0})$ 
is fixed up to high energy degrees of freedom, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq: freq}
    \frac{f}{\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}=\frac{\tem{i}{0}}{\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}\frac{\hk_i}{2\pi}\lr{\frac{\dof{i,0}}{\dof{i}}}^{1/3}\,,
\end{equation}
where the expression follows from conservation of co-moving entropy, which we explicitly show in Sec.~\ref{sec:entropy}. We have written $g_{*,i,0}$ as the current number of degrees of freedom in the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector, while $g_{*,i}$ is the number of degrees of freedom in the $i^{\text{th}}$ sector at the time of GW production.
The BBN bound requires that for any putative hidden sector the relation $\tem{i}{0}\leq\tem{\text{vis}}{0}$ holds, which implies that the maximum frequency is determined by the visible sector. Within one-sector BSM theories, the peak frequency is hence maximised by the SM since this gives the minimal contribution to $g_*$.\\

In the case of stiff equations of state, however, we can increase the ratio $ a_{r}\tem{i}{r}/(a_0\tem{\text{vis}}{0})$ and, by Eq.~\eqref{eq:freqPeak}, the peak frequency. An observation of the CGWB at a frequency bigger than the SM prediction would be a signal of a period with stiff equation of state. As we discuss in the next section, such scenarios typically yield a large amplitude.

In summary, the peak frequency is $f\sim T$ with a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ proportionality constant. Hence one can obtain the frequency at emission from the temperature of a given sector. In standard cosmology, at any time we know $T$ up to high energy degrees of freedom, so measurements of $T_0$ fix this frequency, which turns out to be $f \sim 80 \, \text{GHz}$. In the next sections we will see that an exotic equation of state allows for a larger $T$ than what is expected at a given redshift, thus allowing a larger frequency.

\subsubsection{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:VisibleSector}

In this subsection we reproduce the results of \cite{Ghiglieri:2020mhm} for the leading-order contribution to the CGWB predicted by the SM or an extension thereof belonging to the visible sector.

We thus consider a single sector and a single phase.
Hereby, we neglect the contributions to the CGWB after the EW phase transition because the amplitude is effectively linear with the maximum temperature, recall the discussion below Eq.~\eqref{eq:mastf}.\\

We can use Eq.~\eqref{eq: freq} to find from Eq.~\eqref{eq:mastf}
\begin{align}
\dfrac{\Omega_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0} }{ \Omega_{\gamma,0}}&=\lambda\,  
     \frac{\tem{\text{\tiny{SM}}}{\text{r}}-\tem{\text{\tiny{SM}}}{\text{\tiny{EW}}}}{M_{P}}
     \frac{\dof{\text{vis},0}^{1/3}}{\dof{\text{\tiny{SM}}}^{5/6}} \left(\frac{2\pi f}{\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}\right)^3
    \heta \left(\tem{\text{\tiny{SM}}}{\text{r}},\frac{2\pi f}{\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}\left(\frac{\dof{\text{\tiny{SM}}}}{\dof{\text{vis},0}}\right)^{1/3} \right) \,,
\end{align}
which is in perfect agreement with Eq.(2.21) of~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} and depicted graphically in Fig.~\ref{fig:SMcase}.\\

We stress that the generalisation of the amplitude for weakly coupled extensions of the SM is obtained by simply replacing $g_{*,\text{\tiny{SM}}} \rightarrow g_{*,\text{\tiny{BSM}}}$ and $\eta_{\text{\tiny{SM}}} \rightarrow \eta_{\text{\tiny{BSM}}}$. The power of effective degrees of freedom arises from $\hat{k}^3$, $\rho^{(r)}$ and $ a_{r}\tem{i}{r}/(a_0\tem{\text{vis}}{0})$.
Adding new bosonic or fermionic particles only yields a small change since $\eta$ is dominated by gauge fields through the HTL contribution.
The modifications compared to the SM prediction are thus marginal for such BSM theories as already pointed out in~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}.

\section{Novel CGWB scenarios}\label{sec:results}

The aforementioned results imply that the particle content and interactions of the sector dominating the energy density of the early Universe are observable through their gravitational imprint on the CGWB.
In this section we explore two scenarios involving a hidden sector that is hotter than the visible sector, whilst compatible with the BBN bound:
\begin{itemize}
\item the first scenario amounts to the injection of entropy in the visible sector through the annihilation of degrees of freedom.
\item the second scenario considers a stiff equation of state $P=\omega \rho$ with $\omega>1/3$.
\end{itemize}
The second scenario will actually turn out to be the most phenomenologically appealing as will be explained momentarily.


\begin{figure}[t!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{"scenario_entropy".pdf}}
\caption{Energy density as a function of redshift in the entropy scenario, with SM (black)+hidden (blue) sector radiation (solid) and GW (dashed) energy densities. The standard scenario (green) is also plotted for comparison. For a given reheating temperature, the CGWB sourced in the standard scenario is always bigger.}
\label{fig:EntropyInjection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scenario 1 -- Entropy injection}\label{sec:entropy}

In this scenario, we make use of the following basic fact:
if there is some
field content in the early Universe that eventually gets massive whilst in thermal equilibrium, there is an injection of entropy into the remaining massless degrees of freedom. This leads to the temperature to redshift slower than $1/a$, the sector is being `heated up'. An example of this process is the well-known electron-positron annihilation, which renders the CMB hotter than the neutrino background. In this subsection we study how this heating up of the visible sector can induce different shapes of the CGWB.

\subsubsection*{Injection with one sector}

Initially, we consider a situation with only a visible sector as some extension of the SM.
The sector is effectively colder than in the standard scenario, as illustrated by the black solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:EntropyInjection}. 
This results in a spectrum that peaks at smaller frequencies, according to Eq.~\eqref{eq: freq}, and a different (smaller) ratio $a_{r}\tem{\text{vis}}{r}/(a_0\tem{\text{vis}}{0})$. This is immediate to see from conservation of co-moving entropy $s(t)a(t)^3=\text{const.}$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:comoving}
    \frac{a_r\tem{i}{r}}{a_0\tem{\text{vis}}{0}}=\lr{\frac{g_{*,\tti{0}}}{g_{*,\tti{r}}}}^{1/3} \, .
\end{equation}
The amplitude is therefore smaller than that of the SM, as already pointed out in~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}.\\

An important shift in the frequency would have happened if the field content decreased a lot. 
From Eq.~\eqref{eq: freq}, we observe that, in order to redshift the frequency by an order of magnitude, one requires $g_{*,\text{\tiny{BSM}}}=10^3 g_{*,\text{\tiny{SM}}} \sim 10^5.$ 
This might have happened in multi-field inflation, for the inflatons reaching thermal equilibrium with the bath.
The diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:EntropyInjection} and the fact that $h^2\Omega_{\tti{GW,0}}$ depends on the fourth power of the ratio~\eqref{eq:comoving} show the conclusions of~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} that, with standard equation of state, the standard scenario shows the biggest amplitude for the GW spectrum. 
This remains true in the presence of hidden sectors, although there is the possibility of a richer phenomenology, as we now argue. 

\subsubsection*{Injection with two sectors}\label{sec: inject2sectors}

When the injection of entropy occurs as described above, it can happen that an initially cold sector becomes effectively hotter. We assume that this injection happened in the visible sector in order to avoid the BBN bound by ensuring its energy density is sufficiently large compared to that of the hidden sector. The scenario is illustrated by the black and blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:EntropyInjection}:
initially, the hidden sector is hotter, thus sourcing the largest contribution to the CGWB. However, due to injection of entropy, the redshift of the visible sector is slower and eventually dominates the energy density of the Universe.

Furthermore, there is the possibility that the spectrum features two peaks. This is because, as discussed before, the peak frequency of the visible sector is smaller. Thus, two peaks could appear in the particularly tuned case where the amplitude of the hidden sector and the BSM theory are similar, $\Omega^{(\text{\tiny{vis}})}_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0} \sim \Omega^{(\text{\tiny{h}})}_{\text{\tiny{GW}},0}$, and the peak frequencies sufficiently different.\\

However, the amplitude of these scenarios is smaller than that of the standard scenario for equal maximum temperature, as discussed before. 
Heuristically, this setup achieves to obtain a CGWB dominated by the hidden sector by diminishing the contribution from the visible sector.
Since the SM prediction is still quite far from the reach of proposed experiments~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq}, we do not study this scenario any further. 
The truly new and interesting results appear when considering an exotic equation of state, to which we now turn.

\subsection{Scenario 2 -- Stiff equation of state}\label{sec:kination}

In this subsection we study how the shape of the CGWB is modified if the energy density of the hidden sector is `cooled down'. We model this by a sudden change in its equation of state $P=\omega \rho$, $\omega>1/3$, yielding
\begin{equation}\label{eq: rho redshift}
    \rho(t)=\rho_1\lr{\frac{a_1}{a(t)}}^{3(1+\omega)} \,.
\end{equation}
The behaviour of undergoing such a change is sketched in the blue solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:scenario3}, in the example of a period of \textit{kination} \cite{Gouttenoire:2021jhk}, with equation of state $\omega=1$, which is the maximum value allowed by causality. This scenario is well motivated as a period between inflation and reheating, and in models with axions, where kination follows a matter-dominated era.
The former is not much of our interest since the CGWB is emitted after reheating.
We henceforth restrict ourselves to a cosmological history of the form radiation-kination-radiation, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:timeline},
though our results could be easily generalised to more advanced settings. For recent interesting work on kination inspired by string cosmology see \cite{Conlon:2022pnx, Apers:2022cyl}, and~\cite{Chowdhury:2022gdc} for the study of a kination-like period motivated in scalar-tensor theories, and its consequences the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.

This scenario strongly alters the dynamics of spacetime
since the expansion of the Universe is slowed down in a period of kination domination $H^2\sim a^{-6}$.
However, the causal structure of FLRW is preserved and the GWs follow the same geodesics, redshifting as $\rho \sim a^{-4}$. The shape of $\Omega_{\tti{GW},0} (f)$ emitted by the hottest sector is thus unaltered and Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega f} still applies.\footnote{If this signal has been emitted by a hidden sector, the signals emitted during kination domination from other sectors will be altered because entropy is not conserved, so we cannot use Eq.~\eqref{eq:OmegaSector}. These are, however, subdominant with respect to the former.}\\

To quantify the effects of the kination epoch,
we focus on the GW spectrum $\Omega_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}$ of the hottest sector and compare it against the spectrum $\tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}$ of the equivalent sector in a putative situation without kination.

  \caption{Timeline of the evolution of a sector undergoing kination. The dominant contribution to the CGWB is sourced during the first radiation period, right after reheating, where we integrate Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampl} up to the time given by $a_{ks}$. \label{fig:timeline}}
\end{figure}

One then finds from Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampl}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ \Omega_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}}{ \tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}} \sim \lr{\frac{a_r \tem{i}{r}} {\tilde{a}_{r}\tilde{T}_i^{(r)}}}^4 \,.
\end{equation}
For simplicity,
we assume that the sectors have the same energy density at BBN which implies
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{a}_r \tilde{T}_i^{(r)}=a_{ke}\tem{i}{ke} \, ,\quad a_r T_i^{(r)} = a_{ks} \tem{i}{ks}  \, ,
\end{equation}
where $a_{ks}$ ($a_{ke}$) stands for the start (end) of kination.
We can then
trace the evolution of $T$ from \eqref{eq: rho redshift} by assuming that the changes are instantaneous, thereby giving rise to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tem{i}{ks}}{\tem{i}{ke}}=\lr{\frac{a_{ke}}{a_{ks}}}^{3(1+\omega)/4}\, .
\end{equation}
Hence, the ratio of the amplitudes only depends on the duration of the kination period
\begin{equation}\label{eq: omega kination}
    \frac{ \Omega_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}}{ \tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}^{(i)}} \sim \lr{\frac{a_{ke}}{a_{ks}}}^{3\omega-1}\, .
\end{equation}
In words, this suggests that a period with equation of state $\omega>1/3$ significantly boosts the GW spectrum.
For a given sector and $\omega$, the resulting parameter space containing the number of e-folds and initial temperature is then constrained by BBN bounds analogously to Eq.~\eqref{eq:BBNBound}.
A similar analysis for the frequencies gives 
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{f}{\Tilde{f}}=\lr{\frac{a_{ke}}{a_{ks}}}^{\frac{3\omega-1}{4}} \,,
\end{equation}
implying that the spectrum is blue-shifted compared to the standard scenario.\\

Let us consider a hidden sector described by pure Yang-Mills $\text{SU}(2)$, with hottest temperature $T=10^{-4}M_P$.
If there was no kination period in the early Universe, the CGWB sourced by this sector is negligible\footnote{And the BBN bound is satisfied for the SM and the hidden sector heated up at the same temperature, since $\rho_h/\rho_{\tti{BBN}}=24/(7\Delta N_{\tti{eff}})\lr{g_{*,\tti{BBN}}/g_*}^{4/3}\sim0.53$.}. 
If such a period happened, however, the GW signal emitted by the self-interactions can even saturate the BBN bound, as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig: kination and bounds}.
We thus find that there is a maximum number of kination e-folds that we can allow for, given a maximum temperature. 
In this case, $\tem{h}{1}=10^{-4}M_{P}$, we find that a kination period longer than about $8.5$ e-folds $\lr{a_{ke}/a_{ks}\sim 10^{3.7}}$ is ruled out. 

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{$h^2 \Omega_{\tti{GW},0}$ as a function of frequency in the kination scenario. The plot shows the GW spectrum of a kinating, hidden $\text{SU}(2)$ for different e-folds of kination. If kination is too long, the BBN bound is violated. The standard scenario with only the SM is illustrated for comparison. }
\label{fig: kination and bounds}
\end{figure}

We can give precise bounds using the knowledge of the peak of $h^2\Omega_{\tti{GW},0}$ in the standard scenario with a given maximum temperature $\tilde{T}$. Let us denote this peak by $h^2\tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}$.

Because the CGWB is linear with the maximum temperature, Eq.~\eqref{eq: omega kination} generalises to
\begin{equation}\label{eq: omega kination 2}
    \frac{ \Omega_{\tti{GW},0}}{ \tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}} \sim \frac{T}{\Tilde{T}}\lr{\frac{a_{ke}}{a_{ks}}}^{3\omega-1} \, ,
\end{equation}
where for ease of notation $T$ denotes the reheating temperature in the kination scenario, and we have neglected subdominant contributions to the amplitude from the other sectors. 
In our example, $h^2\tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}\sim 10^{-14}$
for $\Tilde{T}=10^{-4}M_{P}$. 
Imposing that $h^2 \Omega_{\tti{GW},0}<10^{-6}$ in the kination scenario, we obtain a simple bound in the ratio of scale factors:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{T}{M_{P}}\lr{\frac{a_{ke}}{a_{ks}}}^{3\omega-1}< \frac{10^{-6}}{h^2\tilde{\Omega}_{\tti{GW},0}}\frac{\tilde T}{M_{P}}\sim10^4 \, .
\end{equation}
Another example would be the SM undergoing kination. 
Such a scenario is harder to motivate, because of the complexity of the field content of the SM. 
Indeed, kination is usually considered for scalar fields, and it can simply understood as the field quickly rolling down its potential.
We can motivate kination for gauge fields\footnote{This is the most interesting case as it is the gauge fields that source the dominant, HTL contribution to the GW spectrum.} if there is an equivalent description of them in terms of a scalar field, such as after confinement. 
Thus, the previous example could be understood as a weakly coupled YM theory that undergoes confinement, and the effective scalar field undergoes kination.
We cannot motivate a similar setup where the whole field content of the SM is described by a scalar field, or that it undergoes a kination period otherwise.
However, it was pointed out in~\cite{Chowdhury:2022gdc} that an effective period of kination can appear in scalar-tensor theories. 
An analysis for the consequences of the CGWB in such scalar-tensor theories is beyond the scope of this paper, but we believe that our considerations can yield an interesting phenomenology of such scenarios.
We thus provide an example in which the SM undergoes a kination-like period in Fig.~\ref{fig:smkination}. 
For the a maximum temperature $T=10^{-4}M_P$, we find that more than 6 e-folds of kination $\lr{a_{ke}/a_{ks}\sim 10^{2.7}}$ would be ruled out.

\end{figure}


\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We conclude that the CGWB has the potential to test BSM physics, carrying an imprint of the first hot radiation content of the Universe. Being an irreducible background, its detection could  be thought of as a milestone to future detectors, albeit most probably in the very  long term.  %Let us summarise potential implications of such hypothetical observation.
It is worth reiterating that these signals were sourced in the very early Universe, right after reheating, by a radiation bath in thermal equilibrium. Potential high-resolution detectors (and calculations) could be used to study the interactions of hidden sectors through gravity. The CGWB thus sets yet another case \cite{Aggarwal:2020olq} of studying particle physics with GWs. 
We claim that a measurement 
\begin{itemize}
\item around the SM characteristic frequency $f \sim 80$ GHz would imply a strong case for the absence of new physics after reheating, and determine the reheating temperature. 
\item at a smaller frequency would imply either the existence of many massive degrees of freedom, or potentially the existence of a hidden sector. 
\item at a higher frequency would imply a period with a stiff equation of state.
\end{itemize}


Our analysis also rules out a parameter space of e-folds and maximum temperature in models of the form radiation-kination-radiation. These constraints appear for models in which the radiation bath includes gauge fields, since we only considered the hard thermal loop approximation. We point out, however, that similar considerations can be applied to any model with a stiff equation of state that sources GWs. These issues certainly deserve further investigations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

The discovery of the Higgs field~\cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012xdj} represents the first observation of a fundamental scalar field\footnote{Even though the possibility that the Higgs is not a fundamental particle is not ruled out yet, see~\cite{Csaki:2015hcd} for a recent review.}. However, there are many reasons to believe that the Higgs is not the only fundamental scalar degree of freedom existing in nature. In fact, most extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) provide for the existence of scalar fields at various energy scales. Some examples include:

\begin{itemize}

\item{} The existence of a pseudo-scalar field, the QCD axion, is implied by one of the best motivated solutions to the strong CP problem of QCD, via the Peccei-Quinn mechanism~\cite{Peccei:1977hh}, see~\cite{Marsh:2015xka} for a review. 

\item{} At least one scalar field is required in the simplest models of inflation, which is the currently most accepted extension of $\Lambda$CDM: it describes an accelerated expansion of the Universe during its early stages due to the potential energy stored in a scalar field that is undergoing a slow-roll motion, see e.g.~\cite{Baumann:2009ds} for a review. 

\item{} Any supersymmetric extension of the SM includes scalar fields with masses above the electroweak scale, see e.g.~\cite{Martin:1997ns, Weinberg:2000cr}. 

\item{} String theory predicts the existence of several gravitationally coupled scalar fields, called \textit{moduli}, whose vacuum expectation values parametrize the size and shape of the extra-dimensions required for the consistency of the theory~\cite{Ibanez:2012zz}. String theory also predicts the existence of a plethora of axion-like particles, not necessarily related to the strong CP problem of QCD~\cite{Arvanitaki:2009fg, Cicoli:2012sz}.

\item Very recently four-dimensional extensions of the SM (not including gravity) modelled as fundamental QFT have been considered~\cite{Litim:2014uca}. They are based on the UV completion mechanism called \textit{asymptotic safety}, characterized by the presence of a non trivial UV fixed point of the renormalization group which allows to overcome problems such as the presence of Landau poles in the theory. Perturbative analyses of interacting non-Abelian gauge fields, fermions and scalars in the Veneziano limit for different gauge groups and matter representations have shown that generically several fundamental scalar fields are required for the UV fixed point to exist.
\end{itemize}

The classical equations of motion of scalar fields admit (meta-)stable localized solutions\footnote{The energy density associated to a (pseudo-)solitonic solution goes rapidly to zero far away from the centre of the (pseudo-)soliton. While solitons are classically stable due to some conservation law, pseudo-solitons can be long-lived but eventually decay.}, also known as \textit{(pseudo-)solitons}~\cite{Weinberg:1996kr, Rubakov:2002fi, Manton:2004tk, Tong:2005un}. The rapid dispersion of such localized solutions is avoided due to the non-linearity of the equations of motion, giving rise to stable or long-lived compact objects that, if formed during the early Universe, can leave observable signatures in the form of a stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). The detection of such GW background would provide valuable information about the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era~\cite{Kusenko:2008zm, Dolgov:2011cq, Amin:2011hj, Amin:2014eta, Amin:2013ika, Amin:2010jq, Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz}. In some scenarios, long-lived (pseudo-)solitons can survive till the current time, either providing a natural candidate for dark matter~\cite{Kusenko:1997ad, Kusenko:1997si, Kusenko:2001vu, Olle:2019kbo} or a source of distinct signatures if a fraction of the dark matter is in the form of compact objects, see e.g.~\cite{Bai:2016wpg, Braaten:2016dlp, Levkov:2016rkk, Eby:2017xaw, Hui:2016ltb, Desjacques:2017fmf}.

There exist a plethora of distinct (pseudo-)solitonic compact objects, whose differences can be traced back to the mechanism that guarantees their (meta-)stability, see~\cite{Krippendorf:2018tei} for a recent review. If this is ensured by the conservation of a topological charge, the resulting compact object is a \textit{topological soliton}~\cite{Manton:2004tk}. Examples of this class are kinks, vortices and skyrmions. If the stability is given by the conservation of a Noether charge, then the compact object is a \textit{non-topological soliton}~\cite{Lee:1991ax}: some of the simplest representatives of this class are summarized in Tab.\ \ref{tab:Classification}. We collectively refer to the objects appearing in Tab.\ \ref{tab:Classification}, i.e. non-topological solitons composed by a single scalar field, as \textit{scalar stars}.

A complex scalar field whose Lagrangian obeys a global $U(1)$ symmetry\footnote{E.g. if the complex field $\phi$ has canonical kinetic terms and scalar potential $V = \frac{1}{2} m^2 |\phi|^2 + \frac{g}{4!} |\phi|^4$.} \label{foo:Potential} gives rise to non-topological solitons called \textit{boson stars}~\cite{Jetzer:1991jr}; the global $U(1)$ charge guarantees their stability. In the regime in which gravity is negligible the same system leads to non-topological solitons such as \textit{Q-balls}~\cite{Coleman:1985ki}: they can be formed if the attractive self-interactions of the complex scalar field compensate for the gradient energy. Contrary to fermion stars (like neutron stars) for which the mass of the compact object is $M_f\sim M_p^3/m^2$ (where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $m$ the mass of the corresponding particle), typical boson stars have a much smaller mass $M_b\sim M_p^2/m$ and are therefore sometimes called {\it mini-boson stars}~\cite{Jetzer:1991jr}. If the self-interactions are strong enough, i.e. if $g M_p^2/m^2 \gg 1$ (the coupling $g$ is defined in the scalar potential in footnote~\ref{foo:Potential}), the star can be as heavy as the corresponding fermion star and then it is simply called boson star~\cite{Colpi:1986ye}.

In the case of real scalar fields, there is no global symmetry to guarantee the stability of the compact objects, but these can be long-lived due to approximate symmetries~\cite{Mukaida:2016hwd}. The object in question in this case is a \textit{pseudo-soliton}, whose main representative is given by an \textit{oscillaton}. Typical examples of oscillatons are \textit{axion stars}\footnote{Axion stars are expected to be produced in the unbroken PQ scenario~\cite{Kolb:1993zz, Kolb:1993hw, Hogan:1988mp, Visinelli:2017ooc} and for this reason they are particularly well motivated.}. \textit{Oscillons}~\cite{Seidel:1991zh, Kolb:1993hw, Alcubierre:2003sx, UrenaLopez:2001tw, UrenaLopez:2002gx, UrenaLopez:2012zz} belong to the same class as oscillatons, but they are typically restricted to the regime in which the role of gravity is negligible. Their stability is provided by attractive non-linear interactions, rather than gravity: their existence requires the scalar potential to be \textit{shallower than quadratic} at least on one side around the minimum. Oscillons are formed during a preheating-like stage in a wide variety of inflationary models~\cite{Amin:2011hj, Amin:2014eta, Amin:2013ika, Amin:2010jq, Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz}, as well as in string moduli potentials as a consequence of field displacement~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}. We collectively refer to pseudo-solitonic objects arising from a single real scalar field, i.e. the bottom line of Tab.\ \ref{tab:Classification}, as \textit{real scalar stars} (RSSs). The goal in this paper is to explore the importance of gravity for the stability of RSSs, studying their dynamics at the border between the oscillon and oscillaton regimes.

The fate of RSSs is the subject of the analysis in the present paper. It is known that in the free-field case the solutions are characterized by a stable and an unstable branch~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx}: perturbed configurations belonging to the latter either collapse to black holes or they migrate to the stable branch, depending on the sign of the perturbation. In the interacting case, studying the equilibrium configurations is challenging both from the analytic and from the numerical points of view~\cite{UrenaLopez:2012zz}. It is, however, possible to address this question performing numerical studies that include the effects of General Relativity (GR) and the full non-linear dynamics of the self-interactions\footnote{See~\cite{Cotner:2018vug} for an alternative approach.}.

An example of such a study is~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl}, where the authors considered stability of RSSs in the specific case of an axion potential. As expected they found that, depending on the parameters of the model, axions stars can be stable, disperse or collapse to black holes. Interestingly, non-linear interactions are crucial for a proper understanding of the dynamics of these objects: even if the initial radius of the star is much larger than the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, the interplay of non-linear interactions and gravity can drive the star to collapse or to dispersion.

\end{table}

RSSs formed after inflation and before BBN and composed of the inflaton or any other modulus that is displaced from the late-time minimum after inflation~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, deCarlos:1993wie, Banks:1993en, Kane:2015jia} are particularly well-motivated because - when gravity is negligible - the existence of these compact objects requires the potential to be shallower than quadratic, which translates into an attractive interaction between particles. This requirement is met both by inflationary potentials, as the latest Planck 2018~\cite{Akrami:2018odb} results favour plateau-like potentials, and by moduli potentials, since string models feature potentials that open-up on at least one side with respect to the late-time minimum. As we will show in the rest of the paper, the most interesting dynamics appear	 if the effects of gravity become of the same order as those due to self-interactions.

Note that the objects we consider in this work have a compactness\footnote{The compactness is defined as $\mathcal{C} = M/R$, where $M$ is the total mass of the RSS and $R$ its radius, containing $90\%$ of the mass of the star.} comparable to that of the corresponding black hole. The formation of such objects needs to be checked for each specific model via dedicated lattice simulations. In the simplest and most model-independent scenarios, self-interactions of a single field are sufficient to make the quantum fluctuations grow and enter the non-linear regime. The growth can take place mainly through \textit{parametric resonance} (see~\cite{Amin:2014eta} and references therein) or \textit{tachyonic resonance}~\cite{Brax:2010ai}. Focusing on the models studied in the present paper, parametric and tachyonic resonance are efficient production mechanisms in the case of the KKLT model and $\alpha$-attractors T-models respectively\footnote{For $\alpha$-attractor T-models~\cite{Kallosh:2013yoa, Kallosh:2015lwa} the region of the parameter space investigated is borderline in terms of the efficiency of the tachyonic resonance production mechanism, and should be checked through lattice simulations. The formation of RSSs is however beyond the scope of this work and we leave it for the future.}. In the case of $\alpha$-attractor E-models (or Starobinsky-like potentials), the production might be difficult to achieve through parametric and/or tachyonic resonance, but it could take place through other mechanisms, e.g. \textit{i)} through parametric resonance induced by a second oscillating field~\cite{Kofman:1997yn}, \textit{ii)} through some enhancement in the scalar power spectrum, as for the formation of primordial black holes (see~\cite{Widdicombe:2018oeo} for recent work in this direction), \textit{iii)} through dynamical clustering of lighter objects~\cite{Amin:2019ums}.

A better understanding of the evolution of moduli stars is important for a number of reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Non-spherically symmetric oscillons produce GWs due to the dynamics of each single object~\cite{Dufaux:2007pt}. The GW spectrum at production is peaked at frequencies $f \sim \mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. The current diluted value is roughly given by
\begin{equation}
f \gtrsim \left(\frac{m}{\text{TeV}}\right)^{5/6} \, \text{Hz} \,,
\end{equation}
where the uncertainty is related to the knowledge of the exact production time and is removed by numerical simulations. For $m \sim 10^9 \, \text{GeV}$ the peak would fall in the LIGO frequency range. In~\cite{Antusch:2017vga}, the authors parameterized the oscillon profile as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ParametrizedProfile}
\phi(t, \mathbf{x}) = \Phi(t) \mathcal{F}(t, \mathbf{x}) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(t) \equiv \mathcal{A} f(t)$ is the time-dependent oscillon amplitude ($f(t)$ a periodic function, e.g. $f(t) = \cos(t)$), while $\mathcal{F}(t,\mathbf{x})$ is the asymmetric profile. Since the source of the anisotropic stress tensor is $\propto \partial_i \phi \partial_j \phi$, the energy density in GWs produced by such a configuration is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GWSpectrumAmplitude}
\Omega_{\text{GW}} \propto \mathcal{A}^4 \,,
\end{equation}
hence the amplitude of the GW spectrum is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillon field amplitude. Typically, the larger is the oscillaton field amplitude, the larger is the compactness $\mathcal{C}$ of the compact object. In this paper we focus on the dynamical evolution of spherically symmetric configurations, and we leave the analysis of the formation of dense RSSs through various mechanisms operating in the early Universe and of the related GW production to future work.
\item If RSSs are stable for a long time, they could undergo dynamical interactions including the \textit{i)} formation of binaries~\cite{Amin:2019ums} and collisions~\cite{Helfer:2018vtq} with subsequent emission of primordial GWs that would result in a stochastic background; \textit{ii)} clustering and formation of heavier bound objects~\cite{Belotsky:2018wph}, with possible collapse to heavy black holes that could survive even after the decay of the fields that compose the original star, and constitute a dark matter candidate. The richness of these dynamics would be enhanced if the stars collapse to black holes, since the longer lifetime would make it easier for the black holes to cluster. RSSs themselves could constitute a dark matter candidate if the mass of the scalar field is so small that they have not decayed yet, see~\cite{Olle:2019kbo} for recent work in that direction. In the regime of weak gravity, the RSS would have a low density and a very large size, composing the core of dark matter halos and possibly providing a solution to the cusp-core problem of cold dark matter, see e.g.~\cite{Marsh:2015wka}.
\item If RSSs collapse to black holes, these would have a very small mass and would evaporate quickly, providing one of the necessary conditions required for an explicit realization of the \textit{Hawking genesis} scenario proposed in~\cite{Lennon:2017tqq}. As black holes evaporate democratically into all sectors of the model, such a scenario would provide strong constraints on string model building, given that hidden sectors typically contain dark radiation candidates~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Cicoli:2015bpq, Acharya:2015zfk, Halverson:2018xge, Cicoli:2018cgu}, which is highly constrained by CMB measurements~\cite{Aghanim:2018eyx}. Moreover, the collapse to black holes would modify substantially the lifetime of the compact objects. While RSSs have a lifetime which is $\tau_{\text{star}} \sim 10^3-10^4 \times m^{-1}$, the lifetime for a black hole with mass\footnote{We take the mass of the black hole to be of the same order of the mass of the original star, which is consistent with our findings in collapsing cases.} $M \sim M_p^2/m$ would be
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{BH}} \sim \frac{M^3}{M_p^4} \simeq \left(\frac{M_p}{m}\right)^2 \times m^{-1} \,,
\end{equation}
which is larger than $\tau_{\text{star}}$ for any $M_p/m \gtrsim 10^{2}$.
\end{enumerate}

A genuinely new feature of some of the models that we consider in the present paper is the asymmetry of the scalar potential around the minimum. While in symmetric cases the real scalar particles feel either an attractive (if the potential is shallower than quadratic) or a repulsive (if the potential is steeper than quadratic) force, in the case of asymmetric potentials the two behaviours alternate at each oscillation. We would have naively expected this feature to make the RSS more unstable if compared to the symmetric case. We will show in the next subsection that this is actually a model-dependent statement, emphasizing the importance of performing numerical simulations to find out the true RSS dynamics when non-linear interactions and gravity are important.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:Models} we review the models for which we will analyze the dynamics of the RSSs. In Sec.~\ref{sec:NumericalSetup} we briefly summarize the numerical setup that we use for the simulations in the relativistic regime. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Results} we illustrate the results of the simulations. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusions} we draw conclusions and make suggestions for future work.












\section{Models}
\label{sec:Models}

In this Section we introduce the models for which the dynamics will be studied.
In order to determine whether a given potential supports these solutions in the first place let us  consider a single real scalar field $\phi$ in the absence of self-gravity for the non-perturbative scalar field clumps. One crucial parameter is the typical scale of the potential $\Lambda$, which sets the size of the non-linear interactions. Take the for instance the potential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GenericPotential}
V &= \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \lambda \phi^3 + \frac{1}{4!} g \phi^4 \equiv \nonumber  \\
&\equiv m^2 \Lambda^2\left[ \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \frac{\lambda \Lambda}{m^2} \left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{4!} \frac{g \Lambda^2}{m^2} \left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^4 \right] \,.
\end{align}
We define the typical scale of the potential $\Lambda$ as the scale at which the potential deviates significantly from a quadratic potential. Requiring that the interaction terms are of the same order of the mass term in the potential at $\phi \sim \Lambda$, this corresponds to requiring that the couplings are of order
\begin{equation}
\lambda \sim m \left(\frac{m}{\Lambda}\right) \,, \qquad g \sim \left(\frac{m}{\Lambda}\right)^2 \,.
\end{equation}
The potential in Eq. \eqref{eq:GenericPotential} supports RSS (oscillon, i.e. solutions in which gravity is negligible) if~\cite{Hertzberg:2010yz}
\begin{equation}
 \frac{5}{3} \left(\frac{\lambda}{m}\right)^2 - g > 0\ .
 \label{eq:formCond}
 \end{equation}
As a rule of thumb, if the potential is symmetric around the minimum ($\lambda = 0$), it supports oscillon solutions whenever it is ``shallower than quadratic", which translates into attractive interactions. In order to estimate whether or not self-gravity is negligible for these solutions, let us restrict ourselves for a moment to the simpler case $\lambda = 0$: the mass and radius of the RSS in the dense regime, i.e. when the oscillation amplitude of the field is $\phi \sim \mathcal{O}(\Lambda)$, take the form~\cite{Hertzberg:2010yz}
\begin{equation}
M \simeq \frac{m}{g} \simeq \frac{\Lambda^2}{m} \,, \qquad R \simeq \frac{1}{m} \,.
\end{equation}
In order to have a measure of the importance of gravity for the problem at hand, we can take the ratio between the RSSs radius $R$ and the corresponding Schwarzschild radius $R_s$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{R_s}{R} \approx \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_p}\right)^2 \,,
\end{equation}
which suggests that GR effects become non-negligible if the typical scale of the potential $\Lambda$ is close to $M_p$. It follows immediately that for RSSs formed in the \Kahler moduli inflation scenario~\cite{Conlon:2005jm}, as shown in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}, GR effects are never important, since the typical scale of the potential is set by the string scale $\Lambda \equiv M_s = M_p/\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$, where $\mathcal{V} \gg 1$ is the volume of the extra-dimensions.\\
Note that the criterion described above is relevant for the need to include GR effects as we do in this paper - objects with compactness $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (and down to around $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}))$ can show relativistic behaviour during their evolution. But gravity can already provide support for RSSs at much lower compactnesses, and then Newtonian gravity is already necessary (but also sufficient) for their study, see e.g.~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc, Schiappacasse:2017ham}.

In this paper we study various examples of potentials, with highly compact RSSs, in the regime in which GR effects are non-negligible. As already mentioned, we do not deal with the RSS formation mechanism, and we leave the analysis of the effects of GR on such mechanisms to future work. As shown in~\cite{Amin:2019ums}, it is likely that throughout most of the formation and evolution, Newtonian gravity would be sufficient for a study of the evolution from oscillon to oscillaton. It is only in extreme regimes, or in cases in which perturbations are enhanced, that the objects become sufficiently compact for GR effects to be important. One can then ask the question, at what point do such objects become unstable to gravitational collapse? This question is non trivial, especially in cases in which the potential is asymmetric about the minimum, where the object will experience alternating dispersive and attractive interactions during the course of one oscillation. We thus focus on the stability of large perturbations in the field, and the interplay between the non-linear field dynamics, and gravitational effects\footnote{For a similar study in the context of complex field boson stars see~\cite{Cunha:2017wao}.}. 

We will consider three classes of potentials: $\alpha$-attractor T- and E-models, and KKLT. The shapes of the potentials, crucial for the dynamics of the RSSs, is summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:Potentials} where we normalized the mass of the field to the same mass $m$. Although the results illustrated in Sec. \ref{sec:Results} are valid for any value of the mass $m$, for $\alpha$-attractor potentials, once $\Lambda$ is fixed, then also the value of the mass $m$ is fixed in order for the inflationary dynamics to be in agreement with observations.\\

\begin{figure}[htp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.00\textwidth]{Potentials.pdf}
    \caption{Summary of the potentials analyzed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Results}.}
\label{fig:Potentials}
\end{figure}


\noindent \textbf{$\alpha$-attractor T-models}\\
\noindent $\alpha$-attractors have been proposed as supergravity models of inflation~\cite{Kallosh:2013yoa, Kallosh:2015lwa}. In this class of models the field-space curvature, parametrised by $\alpha$, plays a crucial role in the determination of the inflationary observables, as it allows for the tuning of the tensor to scalar ratio. The general scalar potential for $\alpha$-attractor T-models takes the form
\begin{equation}
V = V_0 \, \tanh^{2n} \left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is a normalization constant and $\Lambda$ is the typical scale of the potential, related to the geometrical parameter $\alpha$ via $\frac{\Lambda}{M_p}\propto \sqrt{\alpha}$. Given that the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be written as 
\begin{equation}
r\approx \frac{2}{N_e^2} \frac{\Lambda^2}{M_p^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where $N_e\equiv \ln a$ is the number of efoldings of expansion during inflation, the current upper bound $r\le 0.07$ constrains the scale $\Lambda$ to $\Lambda/M_p < 10$ for $N_e\sim 50-60$. This corresponds to having the observable range of inflationary expansion being produced in the plateau region of the potential.

Normalisation of the scalar curvature perturbations 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_s=\frac{H^2}{8 \pi^2 \epsilon}\sim 2\times 10^{-9}
\label{eq:As}
\end{equation}
implies that the scale of the potential $V_0$ is bounded from above: $V_0\le 10^{-9} M_p^4$.


Around the minimum the potential admits an expansion of the form
\begin{equation}
V=V_0 \left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^{2n} \left\{1-\frac{2n}{3}\frac{\phi^2}{\Lambda^2}+\frac{7 n+10 n^2}{45 }\frac{\phi^4}{\Lambda^4}+\mathcal{O}(\phi^6)\right\}
\end{equation}
and therefore it obeys the ``shallower than quadratic" criterion for the existence of oscillon solutions in the absence of gravity. We stress that this criterium is simply an indication for when the formation might take place in the absence of gravity. If gravity effects are included meta-stable solutions exist even for the free-field case. In our simulations we use the full potential for all models. We will set $n=1$, in which case the cubic coupling vanishes and the quartic becomes $g = - 16 V_0/\Lambda^4$, automatically satisfying Eq. \eqref{eq:formCond}. In this kind of potential oscillons are formed for $\Lambda \ll M_p$ in the broad resonance regime \cite{Amin:2019ums}.\\ 

\noindent \textbf{$\alpha$-attractor E-models}\\
\noindent $\alpha$-attractor E-models of inflation feature a plateau-like potential which is favoured by the latest Planck results~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}. They are a generalization of the Starobinsky potential of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:StarobinskyPotential}
V = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}}\right)^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Notice that the original Starobinsky model has $\Lambda/M_p = \sqrt{3/2}$ while {fibre inflation} corresponds to the case with $\Lambda/M_p = 1/\sqrt{3}$ \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. Like the T-models, this class of models features a minimum at the origin and a flat plateau for $\phi\gg \Lambda$. We note however that while the minimum for the T-models is symmetric, in the case of E-models it is not.

If  $\phi$ is the inflaton field,  to leading order in $N_e\gg1$ one has
\begin{equation}
r\approx\frac{8}{N_e^2} \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_p}\right)^2\qquad\text{and}\qquad \mathcal{A}_s\approx \frac{N_e^2}{12 \pi^2} \frac{V_0}{\Lambda^2 M_p^2}\ .
\end{equation}
Inflationary constraints on $r$ and $\mathcal{A}_s$ map to the bounds $\Lambda/M_p \leq 5$ and $V_0\le 10^{-9} \, M_p^4$. We stress that these only apply if $\phi$ is responsible for inflation and that in Sec.~\ref{sec:Results} we will consider cases where these conditions are violated.

Around the minimum one may expand
\begin{equation}
\frac{V}{V_0}=\left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^2-\left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^3+\frac{7}{12}\left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^4+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^6\right)
\end{equation}
and so the E-model potential is shallower than quadratic to the right of the minimum and steeper to its left, c.f. Fig. \ref{fig:Potentials}. As a consequence of this asymmetry, over the course of a cycle, the RSS particles will experience alternating attractive and repulsive forces.


This class of potential therefore meets the zeroth order criterion for oscillon formation in the absence of gravity. If the oscillon amplitude is small enough such that the quartic expansion of $V$ is a good approximation, the  formation criterion of  Eq. \eqref{eq:formCond} reduces to $V_0 >7/30 \, \Lambda^2 M_p^2$. Note that in this regime $\phi$ cannot be the inflaton as it would violate the normalisation of the scalar power spectrum, Eq. \eqref{eq:As}.\\

\noindent \textbf{KKLT}\\
\noindent KKLT is one of the most well-known mechanisms for K\"ahler moduli stabilisation in Type IIB string compatifications~\cite{Kachru:2003aw}. In its  simplest variant it features one single \Kahler modulus $T = \tau + i a$ describing the overall size of the compactification space. The scalar potential for the complex scalar $T $ is generated by non-perturbative corrections to the action. More explicitly it is generated by the \Kahler potential and superpotential 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KahlerSuperPotential}
K \supset -3 \ln\left(T + \overline{T}\right) \,, \qquad W = W_0 + A e^{-a_N T} \,,
\end{equation}
where $W_0$ is the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential arising from fluxes~\cite{Gukov:1999ya}, $A$ is a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficient depending on the details of the non-perturbative physics that produces the non-perturbative correction and $a_N = \frac{2 \pi}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of D7-branes wrapping the 4-cycle whose volume is parameterized by $\tau$. 
Given that Eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerSuperPotential} implies
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}\supset \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\partial\tau}{\tau}\right)^2=\frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2,
\end{equation}
the canonically normalised volume modulus is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\phi}{M_p}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\ln\tau .
\label{eq:cannorm}
\end{equation}
Assuming that the axion $a$ is stabilised at the minimum of its scalar potential, the potential for $\tau$ arising from Eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerSuperPotential} takes the form
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{V_0}{6 \tau^2} \left[a A^2 (3 + a \tau) e^{-2 a \tau} - 3 a A W_0 e^{-a \tau}\right] + V_{\rm dS} \,,
\end{equation}
where $V_{\rm dS} = V_{\rm up} \, \tau^{-2}$ is an additional term that ensures a de Sitter minimum~\cite{Kachru:2003aw}. This potential features a minimium with vanishing cosmological constant at $\bar{\tau}$ defined by 
\begin{equation}
W_0=-\frac{1}{3}A e^{-a \bar{\tau}}(5-2 a \bar{\tau}).
\end{equation}
Around the minimum the potential admits an expansion of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V=&\frac{a^3 A^2 e^{-2 a \bar{\tau}}}{12 \bar{\tau}^2}\left\{(3+2 a \bar{\tau})(\tau-\bar{\tau})^2+\left(\frac{-19 }{3}a-\frac{6}{\bar{\tau}}-2 a^2 \bar{\tau}\right)(\tau-\bar{\tau})^3\right.\\
&\left.+\left(\frac{59}{12}a^2+\frac{9}{\bar{\tau}^2}+\frac{32 a}{3 \bar{\tau}}+\frac{7 a^3 \bar{\tau}}{6}\right)(\tau-\bar{\tau})^4+....\right\}\ .
\end{split}
\label{eq:VKKLMTmin}
\end{equation}
From Eq. \eqref{eq:VKKLMTmin} and Eq. \eqref{eq:cannorm} one sees that $V$ is asymmetric around the minimum and shallower than quadratic to the right of it, meeting the zeroth order criterium for the existence of oscillon solutions in the absence of gravity. It has been shown in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz} that in the large $|W_0|$ regime\footnote{The minimum in KKLT is located at $|W_0| \sim e^{-a \tau} \ll 1$. The adjective \textit{large} here means $10^{-6} \lesssim |W_0| \lesssim 10^{-2}$.} oscillons are formed in the KKLT scenario.

\section{Numerical Setup}
\label{sec:NumericalSetup}

We use numerical relativity (NR) simulations to search for stable solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) equations with each of the given models. We start with profiles for the scalar field which would, in the absence of self-interactions in the field, provide stable solutions. For each of the models described above, we evolve these forward in time to see if a stable state is reached, or whether collapse or dispersion of the perturbation occurs.

In this Section we give further details of the initial conditions and numerical techniques used, including code verification tests.

\subsection{Initial conditions}

In the free-field oscillaton case, with $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2$, meta-stable solutions\footnote{As emphasized in Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction}, these compact objects are bound to disperse, given that there is no conservation law preventing their decay, see however~\cite{Gleiser:1999tj, Salmi:2012ta, Gleiser:2008ty, Saffin:2006yk, Gleiser:2019rvw}.} to the EKG equations can be found numerically using a shooting method, as in~\cite{Alcubierre:2003sx,UrenaLopez:2002gx,UrenaLopez:2001tw}. Once the field mass $m$ is fixed, they describe a one parameter family of solutions, parameterised by the central amplitude or, equivalently, by the total mass of the perturbation. We will use the latter to specify the initial configurations of the simulations. The one parameter family of solutions is composed of two different branches, i.e. the \textit{stable branch} and the \textit{unstable branch}. For a fixed value of $m$, upon increasing the central amplitude of the field, the total mass $M$ of the equilibrium configurations grows till the maximum value $M_{\rm max} = 3.04 \, M_p^2/m$: this is the stable branch. If the central amplitude is increased any further, the total mass $M$ starts moving towards smaller values: this is the unstable branch. Perturbed configurations on the stable branch quickly go back to a stable configuration, while perturbed configurations on the unstable branch either collapse to black holes (if the perturbation increases the total mass for fixed central amplitude) or it migrates towards the stable branch (if the perturbation decreases the total mass for fixed central amplitude). We will consider configurations that belong to the stable branch in the free-field case, in the range of total masses $2.6 \, M_p^2/m < M < 3.0 \,M_p^2/m$. We choose this range based on the following observations: \textit{i)} below $2.6 \, M_p^2/m$ GR effects become less and less important for the potentials considered in this paper, and \textit{ii)} above the mass $M = 3.04 \, M_p^2/m$ any perturbation makes the free-field RSS unstable, so this value sets our upper bound for the total mass. For definiteness, we consider the three values $M = 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$, $M = 2.9 \, M_p^2/m$ and $M = 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ for the initial total mass of the RSSs, respectively corresponding to the initial central amplitudes $\phi/M_p = 0.2$, $\phi/M_p = 0.3$, $\phi/M_p = 0.4$ for the scalar field of the free-field RSSs. In this way, we quantify and compare the change in stability as a result of the non-linear self-interactions.

A time slice of these solutions is used as the initial conditions for our simulations. For numerical convenience, we choose a slice on which $\phi(r) = 0$ and $\dot \phi(r) \neq 0$, see App. A of~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl} for further details. This gives us a moment of time symmetry (at the level of the metric and the stress-energy tensor) such that the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied. In addition, since the field is everywhere at the minimum in the potential, it does not at this point ``feel'' the deviations from the free-field case, and thus the numerically obtained RSS solutions for the metric and the field satisfy the Hamiltonian constraint exactly, without further modification.

Whilst it should be emphasised that the free-field oscillaton solutions are not necessarily stable once self-interactions are added, they nevertheless provide a convenient set of initial conditions with which to systematically test the stability properties of each model. The interacting solution is likely to be similar to the non-interacting one, at least for small self-interactions, so one may hope that such an approach makes it more likely that we will converge on the stable solutions (compared to starting with, for example, a gaussian, or other random perturbation profiles\footnote{Although note that in \cite{Michel:2018nzt}, gaussians were used successfully to investigate stable and unstable solutions, and yielded results similar to those found in \cite{Helfer:2016ljl}, which used a similar approach to our own.}), if such solutions exist. We note that a failure to settle into a steady state in our simulations is not evidence that no stable solution exists - we could simply have not found it. However, in all cases studied, we do see our solution settle into a stable state below some critical mass, justifying the approach.

A further practical advantage of using the RSS solutions is that one can check that in the limit of small amplitudes and/or small self-interactions, the solution remains stable and unchanged (modulo some initial gauge evolution), which is an invaluable check of the code and potential function.

Finally we note that, for asymmetric potentials, we have a choice of which direction in field space we initially send the field - to the attractive or repulsive part of the potential. We do not find that this makes a significant difference to our results; the collapsing cases will still collapse, just with a longer or shorter timescale. So we choose to always send it in the direction of positive $\phi$.

\subsection{Numerical methods}

We use the publicly available NR code $\textsc{GRChombo}$ to evolve the initial data forward in time. GRChombo is itself built on top of the open source $\mathtt{Chombo}$ framework \cite{Chombo}. For a more full discussion of $\textsc{GRChombo}$ see \cite{Clough:2015sqa}, or the website \url{www.grchombo.org}. For completeness we describe below the key features of the code as used in this work.

The evolution uses the method of lines, with metric and field derivatives calculated using finite difference stencils of the grid values and a Runge-Kutta time integration for the evolution equations. The metric in the 3+1D decomposition:
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = - \alpha^2 dt^2 + \gamma_{ij} (dx^i + \beta^i dt) (dx^j + \beta^j dt) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the lapse and $\gamma_{ij}$ is the three-metric on the equal time hypersurfaces.

The BSSN formulation \cite{Nakamura:1987zz,Shibata:1995we,Baumgarte:1998te} of the 3+1D ADM equations \cite{Arnowitt:1962hi} is used for numerical stability, with CCZ4 \cite{Alic:2011gg} constraint damping terms added to reduce constraint violation over the simulation. The moving puncture gauge  \cite{Pretorius:2005gq,Baker:2005vv,Campanelli:2005dd} is employed to allow the simulations to follow black hole formation - this is a dynamical gauge choice which maintains coordinate observers at approximately fixed positions relative to the center of the domain, avoiding the focussing of geodesics on the overdense regions.

The length of the domain is $L = 64 \times 1/m$, where $m$ is the mass of the field, and we enforce between 4 and 7 (2:1) refinement levels at the start of the simulation with the coarsest having $N$ grid points, where $N=64^3$ is usually sufficient, but several values are used to check convergence. Additional resolution is added if collapse occurs, triggered dynamically by second derivatives in the field $\phi$ and metric conformal factor $\chi$ exceeding set thresholds. The metric conformal factor is defined as $\chi = \left(\det \gamma_{ij}\right)^{-1/6}$, thus the formation of a singularity is signalled by $\chi$ falling to zero at the center, where the metric determinant becomes infinite. Note, however, that due to the rapidly varying amplitude of the field, we frequently needed to fix the resolution at the maximum level achieved using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), following an initial exploratory run, so as to control the errors from too frequent regridding.
Kreiss-Oliger dissipation is used to control numerical errors in the evolution of the fields, in particular that arising at the grid boundaries. We evolve only 1/8th of the grid using the octant symmetry in cartesian coordinates, and apply Sommerfeld boundary conditions (which permit outgoing radiation and thus reduce reflections into the grid) at the outer edges. Whilst a code adapted to the spherical symmetry of the solutions would provide a far more efficient approach, the method adopted gives us the potential to generalise our studies in future work. Beyond tracking the dynamics of $\chi$, we check the formation of black holes by finding the apparent horizon on each spatial hypersurface \cite{Thornburg:2006zb}. Apparent horizons are ``trapped" surfaces for which the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics normal to the surface is zero - for a stationary metric they coincide with the event horizon but in a dynamical spacetime the event horizon (which can only be found by integrating the null geodesics over all time) may lie outside the apparent horizon. An apparent horizon area thus provides a lower limit on the mass of any black hole present in the spacetime.

We have checked convergence of the simulations in critical cases where we identify a boundary between collapse and stability. An illustration of the tests performed is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Converge}. We find the solution to be well converged in the range of base resolutions between $N = 48^3$ to $N = 96^3$. In other simulations away from the critical cases we check that the profiles obtained for the field $\phi$ and the inverse determinant of the metric $\chi$ are indistinguishable when the simulation is performed at several different base resolutions centered on $N = 64^3$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{Convergence_Chi.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{Profile_Ham.pdf}
    \caption{Here we show two plots from our convergence testing for the T-model potential ($n=1$) with $\Lambda/M_p = 0.2$ and total mass of the initial configuration $M = 2.9 \, M_p^2/m$. The first shows that the error in the conformal factor $\chi$ is converging at approximately 2nd order, calculated by comparing the difference between the results at 3 successive resolutions, which correspond to base resolutions of $64^3$, $80^3$ and $96^3$, each with 7 levels of 2:1 refinement. On a plot of $\chi$ versus time the results at the three resolutions are indistinguishable. The second plot shows the L2 norm of the Hamiltonian constraint violation at each resolution, showing that it remains bounded thoughout the simulation and decreases with resolution.}
\label{fig:Converge}
\end{figure}

We note that the time period of our simulations is necessarily much shorter than the expected lifetime of the oscillatons due to computational limitations, such that we cannot explicitly confirm that the solutions we class as ``meta-stable'' will remain so in the longer term. However, where we see the solution settle into a periodic pattern (usually with modulations that appear to be decaying over time), it is reasonable to assume that in the absence of further perturbations it will then slowly decay rather than suffer a sudden collapse. Running several simulations for longer periods supports this intuition.
 
Finally, we also present cases with gravity ``switched off" for comparison. In such cases we evolve only the scalar field dynamics on a Minkowski background, that is, setting $G=0$, and the initial metric to flat space. In doing so we can see how gravity supports the collapse, in addition to the non-linear self-interactions.

\section{Results of the Simulations}
\label{sec:Results}

In this Section we present the results of our NR simulations, showing the dynamics of the central field amplitude $\phi$ and of the metric conformal factor $\chi$. Generically for all the models, as can be seen in the figures,  in the metastable phase the central field amplitude oscillates in proper time such as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ParametrizedProfile}, with $\Phi(\tau) \propto \cos(\omega \tau + \delta)$, $\omega = c\, m$ and $c=\mathcal{O}(1)$. The decrease of $\chi$ to zero at the center signals the formation of a black hole, that we check by finding an apparent horizon whose area gives a lower bound on the mass of the final black hole. For all the cases in which a collapse occurs, the final mass of the black hole, computed using the apparent horizon, is between $85\%$ and $95\%$ of the original mass of the RSS.

\subsection{$\alpha$-attractor T-models}

We consider values of the typical scale of the potential $0.14 < \Lambda/M_p < 0.2$ and we take for concreteness $n = 1$. These values are borderline for the formation of oscillons in the simplest scenario of single field with self-interactions, since the requirement for the formation in that case is $\Lambda \ll M_p$. For smaller values of the scale $\Lambda$, GR effects are always negligible, as already observed in~\cite{Amin:2019ums}. For each value of the typical scale of the potential we vary the initial total mass $M$ of the configuration in the range $2.6 \, M_p^2/m < M < 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$. We observe three peculiar behaviours for RSSs in T-model potentials:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For the smallest $\Lambda/M_p = 0.14$, all the solutions (corresponding to different initial total masses) radiate scalar waves during the first oscillations, settling down into an equilibrium configuration. We show this behaviour for the heaviest initial total mass $M = 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:phiT014phi04N32}. By the end of the simulation the RSS has lost $25\%$ of its initial total mass and the compactness has decreased by a factor $\mathcal{C}_{\rm initial}/\mathcal{C}_{\rm final} = 4.4$.

\label{fig:phiT014phi04N32}
\end{figure}

\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 0.17$ the configurations with initial total mass $2.9 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ collapse to black holes after a few oscillations with increasing amplitude, see left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:T017phi0203} for the $M = 2.9 \, M_p^2/m$ case. The configuration with initial total mass $M = 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$ remains meta-stable after a couple of oscillations with large amplitude, during which it radiates part of the energy into scalar waves, see right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:T017phi0203}.

\label{fig:T017phi0203}
\end{figure}
\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 0.2$ the behaviour is analogous to the case $\Lambda/M_p = 0.17$: configurations with initial total mass $2.9 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ collapse very rapidly to black holes, see Fig.~\ref{fig:phiT02phi03Comp}. Configurations with initial total mass $M = 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$ settles into a stable solution after radiating part of the energy into scalar waves during the first transient stage.

Both solutions are stable - the latter due only to self-interactions - but the former has a larger amplitude of oscillations that could give rise to a larger stochastic background of GWs, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction} (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWSpectrumAmplitude}).}
\label{fig:phiT02phi02Comp}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:phiT02phi02Comp} we show the comparison between the dynamical evolution of the central amplitude of two RSSs with the same initial total mass $M = 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$ when gravity is taken into account (black line) and when gravity are neglected (blue line), for $\Lambda/M_p = 0.2$. Upon adding the effects of gravity the equilibrium amplitude is larger: this could be an important effect for GW production in the light of Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWSpectrumAmplitude}, in the non-spherically symmetric cases. This effect is even more pronounced for stable RSSs with larger initial amplitude but not large enough to make them collapse to black holes.

\subsection{$\alpha$-attractor E-models}

In this case we consider two cases: $\Lambda/M_p = 1$ and $\Lambda/M_p = 2$, so as not to restrict ourselves to a single model. We observe the following behaviours:	\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 1$ the configurations with initial total mass $2.9 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ collapse rapidly to black holes, see Fig.~\ref{fig:chiSa1phi0304}. The configuration with initial total mass $M = 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$ settles into a stable solution after radiating part of the energy into scalar waves.
\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 2$ the configuration with initial total mass $M = 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$ collapses to a black hole, see left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:chiSa2phi0304}, while the configurations with initial total mass $2.6 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 2.9 \, M_p^2/m$ settle into stable solutions after radiating part of the energy into scalar waves, see right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:chiSa2phi0304}.

\end{figure}

In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:phiSa2phi03Comp} we show the comparison between the stable configuration obtained including gravity effects in the simulation (black line) and the configuration with the same initial conditions if gravity effects are switched off (blue line): the presence of gravity makes the RSS stable even in the case in which the attractive self-interactions are not strong enough to allow the existence of the oscillon solution, as evident from the fact that the central field is damped very quickly, i.e. the RSS disperses. At the same time, in the right panel we show how the attractive gravitational interaction can dynamically drive the RSS to black hole collapse, even in a case that would quickly disperse in the absence of gravity effects.

\label{fig:phiSa2phi03Comp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{KKLT}

In the KKLT scenario we observe the same qualitative behaviour for all the initial total masses in the range $2.6 \, M_p^2/m < M < 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$: the RSS radiates part of the energy into scalar waves until it settles into a quasi-equilibrium configuration. We never observe collapse to black holes in this scenario for the region of the parameter space investigated (i.e. $|W_0| \gtrsim 10^{-4}$) for which the formation of oscillons has been studied in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:phiW02phi04} we show the evolution of the central field amplitude for the parameter point $|W_0| = 10^{-2}$ and initial total mass $M = 3.0 \, M_p^2/m$. This point has been chosen in such a way to maximize the typical scale of the potential. At the very end of the simulation the RSS has lost $44\%$ of its mass and it seems to be still radiating energy into scalar waves very slowly. The compactness is reduced by a factor $\mathcal{C}_{\rm initial}/\mathcal{C}_{\rm final} \simeq 5$. Notice the remarkably different behaviour with respect to the case without gravity shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phiW02phi04Comp}: the oscillation amplitude is initially much larger if the effects of gravity are included.

At the very end of the simulation the RSS seems to be very slowly losing energy through scalar radiation. Likely, it will keep losing energy until it reaches an equilibrium configuration close to that obtained by setting $G = 0$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:phiW02phi04Comp}.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

We have analyzed by means of full GR simulations the stability of RSS solutions in various potentials relevant for inflation and for realistic string theory scenarios. Assuming large relativistic perturbations of various masses as an initial condition, we have used NR techniques to study their dynamical evolution and stability. The results are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:Summary}, including the results obtained in the absence of gravity effects. The present analysis is relevant for a better understanding of the post-inflationary dynamics and the possible production of GWs during the pre-BBN era. We have observed several different behaviours, depending on the potential, the parameters of the model and the mass of the initial RSS configuration. While we observe that in KKLT scenarios RSSs are meta-stable in the region of parameter space investigated even for the heaviest initial configurations taken into account, for the other potentials the heaviest RSSs can be dynamically driven (by the interplay of gravity and self-interactions) to collapse to black holes, even if the initial radii are much larger than the corresponding Schwarzschild radii. We have performed a comparison with the corresponding solutions that would be obtained in the absence of gravity, showing that gravitational effects can significantly modify the dynamics of the RSSs in the region of parameter space taken into account. In particular we observe the following general features:
\begin{itemize}
\item In cases in which the RSS quickly disperses in the absence of gravity, gravitational effects can either stabilize it, or drive it to collapse to black hole, see e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:phiSa2phi03Comp} for the case with E-model potential. Hence, one would expect to observe more RSSs (and hence enhanced GW production) than those predicted by lattice simulations of preheating scenarios that do not take into account gravity. Further studies to better understand  the formation of RSSs in these potentials are required, to determine under what circumstances perturbations can grow to relativistic amplitudes.
\item In some cases in which the RSS is stable with self-interactions only, gravitational effects can either enhance the amplitude of the field oscillations in its interior, see e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:phiT02phi02Comp} (T-models) and Fig.~\ref{fig:phiW02phi04Comp} (KKLT), or dynamically drive it to collapse to black holes, see e.g. left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:phiT02phi03Comp} (T-models). While the former effect can have a significant impact on the production of GWs due to the RSS dynamics, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction} (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWSpectrumAmplitude}), the latter effect would significantly affect the reheating history of the Universe.
\end{itemize}

Numerical simulations are valuable tools for understanding the physics of the very early Universe. The simulations we have performed can be easily adapted to study more complex systems of perturbations in the absence of spherical symmetry. Some possible future directions include the production of relativistic oscillatons during preheating, the formation of primordial black holes, and the production of GWs from early matter domination. We plan to return to these and related questions in future work.\\

\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}

Moduli fields are a generic feature of string compactifications.  Typically, they couple to the visible sector via Planck suppressed interactions; fifth force bounds then require their masses to be above the meV scale (see e.g.  \cite{Will:2014kxa, Adelberger:2003zx}). This bound is usually not considered as a challenge for string phenomenology since effective field theory arguments tie moduli masses to the scale of supersymmetry breaking. Thus, even if supersymmetry is responsible for stabilising the weak scale, the lightest moduli are expected to have masses of the order of a TeV. Although they do not mediate any long-range forces, such moduli have a significant impact on cosmology (as vacuum misalignment leads to an epoch in which the energy density of the universe is dominated by cold moduli particles). This leads to interesting phenomenological scenarios which have correlations  between  scales in particle physics and cosmology \cite{mod1, ModuliCosmology}. 

One should keep in mind that the above line of reasoning relies on effective field theory arguments and naturalness considerations. The extreme smallness of the observed value the cosmological constant has put the doctrine of naturalness under question. Given this, it is worth  exploring the phenomenology of string compactifications with light moduli that can mediate long-range forces. For such theories, fifth force bounds impose very stringent constraints \cite{Will:2014kxa, Adelberger:2003zx, Jain:2010ka, Damour:2010rp, Touboul:2017grn, Berge:2017ovy, Wagner:2012ui, Nobili:2018eym}. The couplings between the moduli and the visible sector have to be significantly
weaker than that of gravitational interactions. Thus, the moduli have to arise from hidden sectors which interact very weakly with the Standard Model. Hidden sectors are generic in string theory and are often necessary for the consistency of compactifications, see for example \cite{Giedt:2000bi} for a discussion in the context of heterotic orbifold models, \cite{Cvetic:2004ui} in type II, \cite{Taylor:2015ppa} in F-theory and \cite{Acharya:2016fge, Acharya:2017kfi} in M-theory. Moduli associated with such sectors can have interesting dynamics which can be important for late time cosmology.

%A natural way to realise hidden sectors in string compactifications is to have the visible sector degrees of freedom localised in the extra-dimensions. Degrees of freedom with geometrically separated from the visible sector degrees of freedom have can have weaker-than-Planck suppressed interactions with the visible sector. The strength of the interactions decreases as the separation between the degrees of freedom increases. The goal of this paper is to consider such settings in string compactifications and translate the bounds on fifth forces to conditions on the geometry of the compactification.

There has been steady progress in our understanding of moduli dynamics and their cosmological implications. In this context, the simplest possibility is to  stabilise  all the moduli at a de Sitter minimum. The most well-developed models for such a scenario are in type IIB \cite{Kachru:2003aw, Denef:2004dm, Denef:2005mm, Lust:2005dy, Lust:2006zg, Balasubramanian:2005zx, Cicoli:2013cha, Westphal:2006tn, Louis:2012nb, Rummel:2011cd, Braun:2015pza, Gallego:2017dvd}, where fluxes threading the internal cycles are responsible for a large multitude of solutions \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss, Gukov:1999ya, Bousso:2000xa, Feng:2000if, Giddings:2001yu}. Models in M-theory  were constructed in \cite{Acharya:2006ia}.  For constructions in heterotic strings see \cite{het}, and for constructions in type IIA see \cite{typeIIa}. Constructions in  non-critical strings  have been carried out in \cite{Maloney:2002rr}. There have also been efforts to construct models of quintessence in string/M-theory \cite{Choi:1999xn, Kaloper:2008qs, Panda:2010uq, Cicoli:2012tz, Olguin-Tejo:2018pfq}. Of these, the ones with moduli stabilisation are closely related to the de Sitter constructions and make use of the same approximations. 

At the same time, a conjecture has been put forward  which puts all de Sitter vacua in the swampland \cite{Obied:2018sgi} (for earlier criticisms of dS constructions see e.g. \cite{Banks:2012hx, Bena:2009xk, Bena:2012bk, Moritz:2017xto, Sethi:2017phn, Danielsson:2018ztv}) and implies that the current cosmic acceleration is driven by quintessence. So far, the evidence presented in favour of the conjecture has been only in classical string  theory \cite{Obied:2018sgi} and regimes of parametric weak coupling \cite{Ooguri:2018wrx}, see \cite{Cicoli:2018kdo, Kachru:2018aqn, Kallosh:2018wme, Akrami:2018ylq} for recent reassessments of de Sitter constructions and critical discussions of the conjecture. Related explorations have been carried out in \cite{Agrawal:2018own, Dvali:2018fqu, Andriot:2018wzk, Banerjee:2018qey, Achucarro:2018vey, Garg:2018reu, Kehagias:2018uem, Dias:2018ngv, Denef:2018etk, Colgain:2018wgk, Roupec:2018mbn, Andriot:2018ept, Matsui:2018bsy, Ben-Dayan:2018mhe, Damian:2018tlf, Conlon:2018eyr, Kinney:2018nny, Dasgupta:2018rtp, Murayama:2018lie, Brahma:2018hrd, Choi:2018rze, Das:2018hqy, Danielsson:2018qpa, Wang:2018duq, Han:2018yrk, Moritz:2018ani, Bena:2018fqc, Dimopoulos:2018upl, Heisenberg:2018rdu, Heisenberg:2018yae, DAmico:2018mnx, Ashoorioon:2018sqb, Odintsov:2018zai, Motaharfar:2018zyb, Kawasaki:2018daf, Hamaguchi:2018vtv, Lin:2018kjm, Ellis:2018xdr, Das:2018rpg, Wang:2018kly, Fukuda:2018haz, Hebecker:2018vxz, Gautason:2018gln,  Garg:2018zdg, Park:2018fuj, Blaback:2018hdo, Schimmrigk:2018gch, Lin:2018rnx, Agrawal:2018rcg, Yi:2018dhl, Heckman:2018mxl, Chiang:2018lqx, Cheong:2018udx, Elizalde:2018dvw, Blanco-Pillado:2018xyn, Ibe:2018ffn, Holman:2018inr, Junghans:2018gdb, Banlaki:2018ayh, Andriot:2018mav, Wang:2018fng, Capozziello:2018jya, Dutta:2018vmq, Russo:2018akp}.

% On the observational side, recent analysis of low redshift data (see  e.g. \cite{Wang:2018fng, Capozziello:2018jya, Dutta:2018vmq}) has put $\Lambda$CDM under a bit of tension and quintessence under more, although only at 2-$\sigma$. But  the data could well be hinting at a light scalar which is cosmologically active.

If the present-day dark energy is to be attributed to quintessence (see \cite{Tsujikawa:2013fta} for a recent review of quintessence), then the associated scalar has Compton wavelength of the order of the cosmological horizon. The field is effectively massless and the stringent fifth force bounds described above need to be addressed\footnote{In addition, bounds on the time variation of fundamental constants impose further constraints \cite{Martins:2017yxk}. From a  theoretical perspective, stabilising the potential of the quintessence field against quantum corrections requires fine-tuning at the functional level \cite{Banks:2001qc, Garny:2006wc, Marsh:2018kub}.} (see e.g.  \cite{Carroll:1998zi}). As a possible resolution to the problem, it has been proposed that the quintessence field can be a modulus field  in a hidden sector which is geometrically separated from the Standard Model sector \cite{Agrawal:2018own, Obied:2018sgi}. Geometric separation implies that the wavefunctions of the modes in the extra-dimensions have negligible overlap and hence leads to the absence of certain couplings in the tree level (super)potential. But the sequestering is never complete - higher derivative corrections, loop effects and kinetic mixings invariably lead to interactions between sectors that are geometrically separated \cite{mixkac}. While small, such interactions can have important phenomenological implications: in some situations  they can be used to generate small numbers, while in others they can generate matrix elements that can be dangerous for phenomenology.

The goal of this paper is to analyse the strength of interactions between the Standard Model sector and geometrically separated moduli fields. We will examine the mixings in the context of fifth force bounds, and  translate the bounds to criteria on the geometry of  compactifications. This will give us lower bounds on the volume of compactifications. We analyse mixings that arise between scalars and mixings of $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the case of the scalars, the mixings arise from the diagonalisation of the kinetic and mass matrices. We will argue that in general the mixing from diagonalising the kinetic term provides a lower bound on the strength of the interactions (unless the kinetic and mass matrices are aligned). Given this, in order to keep our results as model-independent as possible we will not commit to any potential for the scalars - we will consider the known form of the \Kahler potential in various string/M-theory constructions and obtain the lower bounds they imply on the strength of interactions between a geometrically separated modulus and the Standard Model sector. The \Kahler potentials we will use are valid in the limit of weak coupling and large volume, this is also the regime in which the effects of geometric separation are expected to be maximal. We find that even the lower bounds imposed by them give interesting constraints on  model building\footnote{Our results should also be interesting in the context of the scalar version of the weak gravity conjecture \cite{Palti:2017elp}, although we do not explore this in detail.}. Our analysis also reveals that in some constructions the geometrically separated modulus couples to different degrees of freedom of the Standard Model
with different strengths. Detailed analysis of the implications of a scalar mediated  fifth force for violations of the equivalence principle has been only carried out for the cases in which the scalar couples with a universal strength to the Standard Model degrees of freedom. Our results motivate a comprehensive study of the phenomenology when the couplings are non-universal.

This paper is organised as follows. Section \ref{sec:fifth} reviews fifth forces mediated by light scalars: the basic formalism used for their study and the experimental bounds. Section \ref{sec:kin} discusses the couplings that arise as a result of kinetic mixing of scalar moduli. Here, we begin with a general discussion which illustrates how potentially dangerous couplings can arise from kinetic mixing. We then go on to  specific examples and obtain the strengths of the couplings that are induced. The computations will use the same methods as in \cite{Conlon:2007gk}, although there the analysis was carried out in the presence of a specific potential - both the kinetic and mass matrices were diagonalised (\cite{Cicoli:2010ha} also diagonalises both kinetic and mass matrices in a large class of examples). Having obtained the strength of the interactions we will use the observational bounds on fifth forces mediated by light scalars to discuss the implications of our results for model building (particularly in the context of quintessence). Section \ref{sec:uone} deals with kinetic mixing of gauge bosons. Section \ref{sec:disc} gives a general discussion of our results and future directions. 
%We  conclude.  in Section \ref{sec:conc}.



\section{Light Scalars and Fifth Forces} 

\label{sec:fifth}

Fifth forces are ubiquitous in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories. For detailed reviews of the experimental efforts to detect fifth forces, the bounds and the theoretical origin of fifth forces in various BSM scenarios see e.g. \cite{Will:2014kxa, Adelberger:2003zx, Jain:2010ka}. Our discussion shall be in the context of light scalars, in particular the fifth force that would be mediated by a scalar field driving quintessence. Recall that the mass of  the field driving quintessence has to be of the order of $10^{-32} \phantom{a} \text{eV}$ and the corresponding Compton wavelength is approximately $10^{25} \phantom{s} \text{m}$. This is almost of the size of the observable universe: for the purposes of studying the effects that such a scalar can have on the violations of the equivalence principle it can be taken to be massless. The basic formalism for analysing the violations of the equivalence principle that can be induced by a scalar (both massive and massless) was developed in \cite{Damour:2010rp} (for a qualitative and simplified discussion in the context of quintessence we refer the reader to \cite{Carroll:1998zi}). Here we briefly review the results of \cite{Damour:2010rp} that shall be relevant for our discussion.

The starting point for the analysis of \cite{Damour:2010rp} is the effective action for the Standard Model and the scalar at energy scales
slightly above $1 \ {\rm{GeV}}$. The relevant degrees of freedom in the Standard Model are the up $(u)$ and down $(d)$ quarks, the electron $(e)$, the photon $A_{\mu}$ and the gluonic gauge fields $A_{\mu}^{A}$ (it can be argued that the effects related to the strange quark are negligible). The couplings of the scalar $(\chi)$ to the Standard Model degrees of freedom are characterised by five parameters $d_i$ $(d_e, d_g, d_{m_{e}}, d_{m_{u}}$ and $d_{m_{d}})$ which appear in the interactions of the scalar:
 %
 \begin{equation}
 \label{phiint}
   \mathcal{L}_{\rm{int}\chi} = {\chi \over M_{\rm pl} }\left[ +{d_e  \over 4 e^2 } F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} - { {d_g \beta_3(g_3)} \over {2 g_3} } F_{\mu \nu}^{A} F^{A \mu \nu}
  - \sum_{e,u,d} \left(d_{m_i} + \gamma_{m_{i}} d_g \right) m_i \bar{\psi}_i \psi_i \right] \,,
 \end{equation}
 where $\beta_3(g_3) = \mu \partial g_3(\mu)/ \partial \mu$ is the QCD $\beta$-function that governs the running of $g_3$ and the second term in Eq. \eqref{phiint} is given by the QCD trace anomaly.
 %
Reference \cite{Damour:2010rp} analysed violations of the equivalence principle that can arise as a result of the above interactions and found that the violations induced are a function of the mass of the scalar, composition of the test bodies and a four dimensional subspace of the five dimensional parameter space.
 
The interactions in Eq. \pref{phiint} are defined at a low scale $(\mu \sim 1 \phantom{a} \rm{GeV})$. They are supposed to be
determined from RG evolution of a high scale Lagrangian derived from string (or any other UV complete) theory, defined at a cut-off scale $\Lambda_c$. The UV Lagrangian would contain the terms:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{UVLag}
   \mathcal{L}_{\Lambda_c} \supset   -  {1 \over  {4 e^2(\Lambda_c, \chi)}} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} - {1 \over  {4 g_3^2(\Lambda_c, \chi)}}  F_{\mu \nu}^{A} F^{A, \mu \nu}
   - \sum_{e,u,d}  m_i (\Lambda_c, \chi) \bar{\psi}_i \psi_i \,.   
\end{equation}
%
The UV interaction strengths can be defined by introducing the parameters $(d^c_{i})$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{UVint}
  d^{c}_e  = M_{\rm pl} { {\partial \ln e^2(\Lambda_c, \chi)} \over \partial{\chi}},  \qquad
  d^{c}_g  = M_{\rm pl} { {\partial \ln g_3^2(\Lambda_c, \chi)} \over \partial{\chi}},  \qquad
  d^{c}_{m_{i}}  = M_{\rm pl} { {\partial \ln m_{i}(\Lambda_c, \chi)} \over \partial{\chi}}.
\end{equation}
%
While the precise relationships between the UV interaction strengths $(d^{c}_i)$ and the low energy parameters $(d_i)$ will depend on the details of the theory, \cite{Damour:2010rp} argued on general  grounds that
%
\begin{equation}
\label{rela}
   d_e \sim d_e^c, \qquad d_g \sim K d_g^c , \qquad  d_{m_{i}} \sim K_{m_{i}} d^c_{m_{i}} \,,
 \end{equation}
%
where $K, K_{m_{i}}$ are constants of the order of $40$. A more detailed analysis of violations of the equivalence principle was carried out assuming that all the UV interactions are of the same magnitude 
(as is true in many string theory examples), i.e.
%
$$
  d_e^{c} \sim d_g^c \sim d^c_{m_{i}} \equiv d^c,
$$
%
In this case, it was found that the equivalence principle violating effects can be parametrised in terms of only two variables (which are functions of the $d_i$ and the atomic weights and numbers of the test bodies) and the mass of the scalar. Using the results of the E\"{o}tWash experiment \cite{Schlamminger:2007ht} and celestial Lunar Laser Ranging \cite{Williams:2004qba}, for massless scalars ref. \cite{Damour:2010rp} obtained the bound 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{boundt}
 \left(d^c\right)^2 < 10^{-12}.
\end{equation}
%
More recently, data from the MICROSCOPE mission \cite{Touboul:2017grn} has been analysed using the two variable parametrisation of \cite{Damour:2010rp}. Consequently, the above bound has become stronger by one order of magnitude \cite{Berge:2017ovy}. 
 
\section{Kinetic mixing of Scalars}

\label{sec:kin}

\subsection{General argument}

In this subsection, we  argue that in general geometric separation does not lead to complete sequestering between a modulus and the visible sector, as kinetic terms always produce mixings. Consider $N$ scalar fields $\phi^I$ with the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = K_{IJ} (\phi^{I}) \partial_\mu \phi^I \partial^\mu \phi^J - V(\phi_I) \,,
\end{equation}
where the kinetic matrix $K_{IJ}$ is positive definite and $I, J = 1, \dots, N$. In string/M-theory compactifications, the kinetic and  potential terms are derived from the \Kahler and superpotential of the construction. These are computed in the geometric basis for the scalars, that leads to the absence of direct couplings between geometrically separated sectors in the tree level superpotential. In order to obtain physical couplings, canonical normalisation has to be carried out. At any specific point in field space one can write the fields
 $\phi^{I}$ as sums of their expectation values and fluctuations: $\phi^{I} = \langle \phi^I \rangle + \delta \phi^{I}$, then carry out a linear change in basis which takes the fluctuations in the geometric basis ($\delta \phi^{I}$) to the canonical ones ($\varphi^{I}$):
%
\begin{equation}
\delta \phi^I = \mathcal{M}^I_J \varphi^J \,,
\end{equation}
%
where the matrix $\mathcal{M}^{I}_{J}$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\label{bchange}
K_{IJ} \mathcal{M}^I_K \mathcal{M}^J_L = \delta_{KL} \,,
\end{equation}
%
so that the kinetic terms becomes diagonal. We note that the matrix $\mathcal{M}^{I}_{J}$ is easily obtained from the eigenvectors of kinetic matrix. The condition in Eq. \pref{bchange} can be satisfied by taking
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationGeneral}
\mathcal{M}^I_J = \frac{e^I_J}{\sqrt{\lambda_J}} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $e^{I}_{J}$ is the $J^{\rm th}$ eigenvector (normalised to unity) of the kinetic matrix and $\lambda_J$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Consider a situation where in the geometric basis a certain Standard Model coupling is determined by particular field a ($\phi^A$), for instance the gauge coupling of D7-branes wrapping the cycle $A$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CouplingGaugeQ}
{ \mathcal{L} } \supset  \phi^{\large{A}} F^{a}_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \ ,
\end{equation}
%
On making the basis change to the canonical basis this leads to a term in the Lagrangian:
%
%
\begin{equation}
{ \mathcal{L} } \supset  M^{\large{A}}_{\phantom{A}J} \varphi^{J} F^{a}_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
%
Note that in the new basis, the strength of the coupling of a (geometrically separated) scalar $\varphi^{B}$ to the gauge fields is determined by the magnitude of the off-diagonal entry $M^{\large{A}}_{\phantom{A}B}$. Thus, potentially dangerous couplings
between the Standard Model gauge bosons and a geometrically separated scalar can be generated. Similarly, the Standard Model Yukawas can also acquire dependence on hidden sector scalars. We will examine both dependences in detail in the examples below.

After canonically normalising kinetic terms, the  mass matrix has to be diagonalised. This basis change depends on the potential for the scalars. If the mixings induced by this are of smaller magnitude than those induced by the basis change required for canonical normalisation of the kinetic terms, they can be neglected. On the other hand, if the mixings that arise from diagonalising the mass matrix are of larger magnitude, then the interactions induced are of greater strength than those obtained from  canonical normalisation of the kinetic terms. If both basis change matrices have off-diagonal entries of the same order of magnitude, the strength of interactions is in general of the order of magnitude given by those obtained from canonical normalisation of the kinetic matrix. Thus, unless the kinetic and mass matrices are aligned so that their effects precisely cancel, the strength of the mixings
after diagonalising the mass matrix can only \textit{increase}. Therefore, in order to make our study model independent we will not commit to any potential for the scalars. We will consider \Kahler potentials in various compactifications and obtain the strengths of the mixings they induce\footnote{See \cite{Conlon:2007gk, Cicoli:2010ha} for computations where both kinetic and mass matrices are diagonalised. The basis mechanism behind the mixings is similar.}. Our results should therefore be considered as {\it lower bounds} on the strengths of the interactions.

Given the constraints from fifth force bounds and time variation of fundamental constants, our results have interesting implications for model building with light scalars (particularly in the context of quintessence). The above arguments imply that there are essentially two ways to avoid dangerous couplings between the Standard Model sector and a light scalar: 
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item The size of the off-diagonal entries in the basis change matrix (which induce the coupling between the scalar and the visible sector) are small. This will impose lower bounds on the volume of the compactification in the examples that we consider below. 
 %
\item There is negligible coupling between the light direction in field space and the Standard Model. This requires tuning. Firstly, this would require an alignment between the kinetic and mass matrices (as described above). Secondly, in general different Standard Model degrees of freedom couple to different directions in the scalar field space (as we will see in the examples below). Thus the absence of couplings to all the degrees of freedom would require further tuning.  
%      
     \end{itemize}
%
We now turn to the analysis of kinetic mixing in specific settings. We shall consider examples where the geometrically separated scalar is a blow-up mode or fibre modulus. The visible sector will be realised by branes wrapping a blow-up cycle or from branes at singularities. It will suffice to consider semi-realistic models of the visible sector for our purposes.

\subsection{Blow-up Models}

Blow-up moduli, corresponding to resolutions of point-like singularities, have their wavefunctions localised in the internal manifold. If the visible sector degrees of freedom are localised away from the resolution, then it is natural to expect that they will interact with the blow-up of a point-like singularity weakly. In this subsection, we will take the light scalar (candidate to be driving quintessence) to be a blow-up mode. We start by looking at IIB  string theory, where we consider two examples: the case when the Standard Model is realised from D7-branes wrapping another blow-up mode (in the geometric regime) and the case when it is realised from branes at singularities.  We then study an example in M-theory with a single blow-up mode.


\subsubsection{SM at a geometric blow-up}
\label{twoblow}

In type IIB Calabi-Yau compatifications, the \Kahler potential is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    K = -2  \log {\mathcal{V}},
\end{equation}
%
where ${\mathcal{V}}$ is the volume of the compactification. Consider  a Swiss-cheese type Calabi-Yau which has three \Kahler moduli: with $\tau_0$ as the big cycle and $\tau_{1,2}$ as two blow-ups.  We  will work with a setup where the Standard Model degrees of freedom will be localised on $\tau_1$ and the role of geometrically separated light modulus is played by $\tau_2$. The \Kahler potential for the moduli takes the form:
\begin{equation}
K = -2 \log\left(\alpha\left(\tau_0^{3/2} - \gamma_1 \tau_1^{3/2} - \gamma_2 \tau_2^{3/2}\right)\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where  $\alpha$, $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are constants\footnote{For explicit realisations in weighted projective spaces see  e.g. \cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm}.}. In the large volume limit, ${V} \simeq \tau_0^{3/2} \gg 1$, we can work perturbatively in $\epsilon \equiv \tau_0^{-1} \ll 1$. The \Kahler metric can be expanded as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DecomposedMetric}
K_{ij} = K^{(0)}_{ij} + K^{(1)}_{ij} + K^{(2)}_{ij} + . . . \,,
\end{equation}
%where $K^{(0)} \gg K^{(1)} \gg K^{(2)}$.
with
\begin{equation}
K^{(0)}_{ij} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
A \epsilon^2 && 0 && 0 \\
0 && B \epsilon^{3/2}  && 0 \\
0 && 0 && C \epsilon^{3/2}
\end{pmatrix} \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K^{(1)}_{ij} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 && D \epsilon^{5/2} && E \epsilon^{5/2}  \\
D \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0 \\
E \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0
\end{pmatrix} \,, \quad
K^{(2)}_{ij} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 && 0 && 0 \\
0 && 0 && F \epsilon^{3} \\
0 && F \epsilon^{3} && 0 ,
\end{pmatrix} \ ,
\end{equation}
where  we have defined
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{4} \,, \qquad B = \frac{3 \gamma_1}{8 \sqrt{\tau_1}} \,, \qquad C = \frac{3 \gamma_2}{8 \sqrt{\tau_2}} \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D = -\frac{9}{8} \gamma_1 \sqrt{\tau_1} \,, \qquad E = -\frac{9}{8} \gamma_2 \sqrt{\tau_2} \,, \qquad F = \frac{9}{8} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \sqrt{\tau_1 \tau_2} \,.
\end{equation}
The unperturbed eigenvalues (denoted by superscript $(0)$) can be read then from the diagonal entries of the matrix $K^{(0)}$ and are
\begin{equation}
\lambda_0^{(0)} = A \epsilon^2 \,, \qquad \lambda_1^{(0)} = B \epsilon^{3/2} \,, \qquad \lambda_2^{(0)} = C \epsilon^{3/2} \,,
\end{equation}
corresponding to the unperturbed eigenvectors
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}^{(0)} = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\right\} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Recall that non-degenerate perturbation theory is good as long as the splittings in the unperturbed eigenvalues are larger than the size of the perturbations. We will assume that we are away from special points in moduli space where the splittings are small or comparable to the perturbations, and use non-degenerate perturbation theory to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $K_{ij}$\footnote{For special points in the moduli space where the splittings are small in comparison with the perturbations, our results can be easily generalised using degenerate perturbation theory. Here we note that typically break down of non-degenerate perturbation theory implies that the perturbation leads to stronger mixings between the unperturbed eigenvectors.}. 

Consider the first perturbation, $ K_{ij}^{(1)}$: the perturbed eigenvalues can be computed in perturbation theory by solving the equation
\begin{equation}
\det\left(K_{ij}^{(0)} + \epsilon K_{ij}^{(1)} - \lambda \delta_{ij}\right) = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
As expected for off-diagonal corrections connecting non-degenerate eigenvalues, the correction appears at $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in perturbation theory. We define
\begin{align}
\lambda^{(1)}_0 = \lambda_0^{(0)} + \delta_1 \lambda_0 \,, \qquad \lambda^{(1)}_1 = \lambda_1^{(0)} + \delta_1 \lambda_1 \,, \qquad \lambda^{(1)}_2 & = \lambda_2^{(0)} + \delta_1 \lambda_2 \,.
\end{align}
Then the corrections are
\begin{equation}
\delta_1 \lambda_0 \simeq \frac{B E^2 + C D^2}{BC} \epsilon^{7/2} \,, \qquad \delta_1 \lambda_1 \simeq \frac{D^2}{B} \epsilon^{7/2} \,, \qquad \delta_1 \lambda_2 \simeq \frac{E^2}{C} \epsilon^{7/2} \,.
\end{equation}
Using these results we can find the first-order perturbed eigenvectors:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}^{(1)} = \left\{ v_0^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \beta_0^{(1)} \\ \gamma_0^{(1)} \end{pmatrix}, v_1^{(1)} =  \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1^{(1)} \\ 1 \\ \gamma_1^{(1)} \end{pmatrix}, v_2^{(1)} =  \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_2^{(1)} \\ \beta_2^{(1)} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\beta_0^{(1)} = -\frac{D}{B} \epsilon \,, \qquad \gamma_0^{(1)} = - \frac{E}{C} \epsilon \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\alpha_1^{(1)} = \frac{D}{B} \epsilon \,, \qquad \gamma_1^{(1)} = \frac{ED}{B(B-C)} \epsilon^2 \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Eigenvec15}
\alpha_2^{(1)} = \frac{E}{C} \epsilon \,, \qquad \beta_2^{(1)} = \frac{ED}{C(C-B)} \epsilon^2 \,.
\end{equation}
%
Next, we compute the corrections induced by $K^{(2)}_{ij}$. They can be computed by simply requiring that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EigenvaluesEquation32}
\left(K_{ij}^{(0)} + K_{ij}^{(1)} + K_{ij}^{(2)}\right) v^{(2)}_j = \lambda^{(1)}_i v^{(2)}_i\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
v^{(2)}_i = v_i^{(1)} + \delta_2 v_i \,, \quad i=1,2,3 \,,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
v_0^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \beta_0^{(1)} \\ \gamma_0^{(1)} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \delta_2 \alpha_0 \\ \delta_2 \beta_0 \\ \delta_2 \gamma_0 \end{pmatrix} \,, \quad v_1^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1^{(1)} \\ 1 \\ \gamma_1^{(1)} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \delta_2 \alpha_1 \\ \delta_2 \beta_1 \\ \delta_2 \gamma_1 \end{pmatrix} \,, \quad v_2^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_2^{(1)} \\ \beta_2^{(1)} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \delta_2 \alpha_2 \\ \delta_2 \beta_2 \\ \delta_2 \gamma_2 \end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
%
The only non-subleading contributions are
\begin{equation}
\delta_2 \gamma_1 = \frac{F}{B-C} \epsilon^{3/2} \,, \qquad \delta_2 \beta_2 = \frac{F}{C-B} \epsilon^{3/2} \,.
\end{equation}

Having obtained the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, let us compute the basis change which relates the geometrical moduli to the canonically normalised ones. As we do not make assumptions about the scalar potential, let us expand the fields $\tau_i = \langle \tau_i \rangle + \delta \tau_i$ around the generic point ($\langle \tau_0\rangle$, $\langle \tau_1 \rangle$, $\langle \tau_2 \rangle$). The first entry fixes the value of the expansion parameter $\epsilon = 1/ \langle \tau_0 \rangle$, while the last entry is the classical value of the quintessence field. 
%Typically 
%the fields $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$ take VEVs of order $\langle \tau_{1,2}\rangle \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10\right)$. 
Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationGeneral} then gives the basis change matrix to be 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} \epsilon} && - \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_1^{1/2}} \epsilon^{1/4} && - \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \epsilon^{1/4} \\
2 \sqrt{3} \langle \tau_1 \rangle && \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3 \gamma_1} \epsilon^{3/4}} && \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}} \epsilon^{3/4} \\
2 \sqrt{3} \langle \tau_2 \rangle && \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{5/4} \langle \tau_2 \rangle}{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}} \epsilon^{3/4} && \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3 \gamma_2} \epsilon^{3/4}}
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
so that the moduli $\delta\tau_i$ can be written in terms of the canonically normalized fields $\varphi_0, \varphi_1, \varphi_2$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:BigfieldRotated}
\delta\tau_0 &= \mathcal{M}_{0i} \varphi_i = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3} \epsilon} \varphi_0 - \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_1^{1/2}} \epsilon^{1/4} \varphi_1 - \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \epsilon^{1/4}  \varphi_2 \,, \\
\label{eq:SMfieldRotatedx}
\delta\tau_1 &= \mathcal{M}_{1i} \varphi_i = 2 \sqrt{3} \langle \tau_1 \rangle \varphi_0 + \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3 \gamma_1} \epsilon^{3/4}} \varphi_1 + \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}} \epsilon^{3/4} \varphi_2 \,, \\
\label{eq:QfieldRotatedx}
\delta\tau_2 &= \mathcal{M}_{2i} \varphi_i = 2 \sqrt{3} \langle \tau_2 \rangle \varphi_0 + \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{5/4} \langle \tau_2 \rangle}{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}} \epsilon^{3/4} \varphi_1 + \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3 \gamma_2} \epsilon^{3/4}} \varphi_2 \,.
\end{align}

\noindent{{\underline{Couplings to Gauge Bosons}}}\\
For D7-branes wrapping $\tau_1$, the gauge coupling is determined by a holomorphic term
%
\begin{equation}
\label{gc}
\mathcal{L} \supset - \frac{\tau_1}{4 \pi} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Upon canonical normalisation of the fields\footnote{We use the  normalisation for the gauge fields in which their kinetic terms are given by $\mathcal{L} \supset - \frac{1}{4 e^2} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu}$, as with this it is easier to compare with the bounds inferred in~\cite{Damour:2010rp}. }, the last term in Eq. \eqref{eq:SMfieldRotatedx} produces an effective dimension five coupling between the photon and the quintessence field 
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\sigma \varphi_2}{\langle{V}\rangle^{1/2} } F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Sigma}
\sigma = \frac{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}} \,.
\end{equation}
%
On restoring units, the interaction is suppressed by a scale 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{supr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} {V}^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
%
Note that the scale the suppression is weaker that $M_{\rm pl}$ by a factor of square root of the volume of the compactification.

\noindent{{\underline{Couplings to Matter Fields}}}\\
Next, let us compute how the scalar $\tau_2$ couples to matter fields localised on a D7-brane wrapping the cycle $\tau_1$. For this, one requires a knowledge of the matter metrics in the visible sector. While these are not know in general, they can be determined in the limit of $\tau_0 \gg \tau_1$ ~\cite{Conlon:2006tj, Aparicio:2008wh, Aparicio:2015psl}. For matter arising from D7-branes wrapping the a blow-up cycle, the matter metric is:
%
\begin{equation}
K_{\alpha \beta} \sim \frac{\tau_1^{1/3}}{{V}^{2/3}} \delta_{\alpha \beta} \simeq \frac{\tau_1^{1/3}}{\tau_0} \left(1 + \frac{2}{3} \frac{\tau_1^{3/2}}{\tau_0^{3/2}} + \frac{2}{3} \frac{\tau_2^{3/2}}{\tau_0^{3/2}}\right) \, \delta_{\alpha \beta} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Taking $\tau_i = \langle \tau_i \rangle + \delta \tau_i$, to leading order in the fluctuations
%
\begin{equation}
\label{matmet}
K_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{\langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/3}}{\langle {V} \rangle^{2/3}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta \tau_1}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle} - \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 + \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\langle {V} \rangle = \alpha\left(\langle\tau_0\rangle^{3/2} - \gamma_1 \langle\tau_1\rangle^{3/2} - \gamma_2 \langle\tau_2\rangle^{3/2}\right)$.  The Lagrangian for matter fields, in particular the electron $e$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset K_{e \overline{e}} \overline{e} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu e +  e^{K/2} \tilde{y} H \overline{e} e \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\tilde{y}$ is the cubic superpotential Yukawa coupling. Note that
\begin{equation}
e^{K/2} \simeq  {V}^{-1} \simeq \frac{1}{\langle {V} \rangle} \left(1 - \frac{3}{2} \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{3}{2} \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 +  \frac{3}{2} \frac{ \gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2 + \mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Hence
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} &\supset K_0 \overline{e} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu e \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta \tau_1}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle} - \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 + \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) + \\
&+ \frac{\tilde{y} H}{\langle {V} \rangle} \overline{e} e \left(1 - \frac{3}{2} \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{3}{2} \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 +  \frac{3}{2} \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) \,.
\end{align}
where $K_0 = \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/3}/\langle {V} \rangle^{2/3}$. After canonical normalization of the electron field: $\hat{e} = \sqrt{K_0} e$ and electroweak symmetry breaking, the Lagrangian takes the form
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} \supset \,\, & \overline{\hat{e}} \left(\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu + m_e\right) \hat{e} \left(1 +\frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta \tau_1}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle} - \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 + \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) + \nonumber \\
\label{eq:couplings}
&- m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \left(\frac{1}{2} \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta \tau_1}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\gamma_1 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $m_e$ is the electron mass. %$ = \frac{\tilde{y} v}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/3} \langle {V} \rangle^{1/3}}$ ($v$ denotes the VEV of H). 
The contributions from the first line of Eq. \eqref{eq:couplings} vanish on-shell: the physical couplings are determined purely from the contributions in the second line. We can also neglect the term proportional to $\delta \tau_1/\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}$, since it is subleading with respect to the term proportional to $\delta\tau_1/\langle \tau_1\rangle$. Using the  expressions for the basis change in  (\ref{eq:BigfieldRotated}-\ref{eq:QfieldRotatedx}) we infer the couplings of the electron to the canonically normalised (quintessence) scalar $\varphi_2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{ecoup}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset - \left(\frac{\sigma_0}{\langle {V} \rangle^{5/6}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} + \frac{\sigma_1}{\langle {V} \rangle^{1/2}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} + \frac{\sigma_2}{\langle {V} \rangle^{1/2}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} \right) m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = \frac{\sqrt{6} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \,, \qquad \sigma_1= \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4}}{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} - \gamma_1 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}} \,, \qquad \sigma_2 = - \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma_2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{3/4} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Notice that the electron coupling is suppressed by the same scale as in Eq. \pref{supr} for the gauge bosons, i.e. there is a factor of ${V}^{1/2}$ in addition to the $M_{\rm pl}$ suppression of the dimension five operators\footnote{There are ambiguities in the form of the matter metric in Eq. \pref{matmet} at subleading order in the inverse volume expansion \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk, Conlon:2011jq}. These can affect the last term in Eq. \pref{ecoup}, but the first and second term would not be affected.}. Couplings of the quarks can be computed in exactly the same manner, their interactions are also suppressed by the same scale.

\noindent{\underline{Bounds}}\\
Now, let us discuss implications of our result in the context of the bounds on fifth forces and time variation of fundamental constants. We have found $\varphi_2$ couples to both the gauge fields and Standard Model fermions with interactions which are suppressed by a scale $\Lambda \sim {V}^{1/2} M_{\rm pl}$. As we want to infer order-of-magnitude contraints at the string scale, using a value of the gauge couplings compatible with unification $\alpha^{-1} \simeq 1/25$ (i.e. $4 e^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), the most stringent bound comes from
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ExplicitConstraint}
d^c \simeq \frac{4 e^2 \sigma}{{V}^{1/2}} < 10^{-6} \,,
\end{equation}
which translates into a lower bound on the volume:
 %
 \begin{equation}
 \label{lower}
    {V} > 10^{12},
    \end{equation}
 %
which is a rather strong condition. In Eq. \eqref{eq:ExplicitConstraint} we have assumed that the blow-up dependent coefficient $\sigma$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:Sigma} is of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Notice that this is a mild assumption and anyway a value of $\sigma$ which slightly deviates from $\mathcal{O}(1)$ does not affect the strong result in Eq. \eqref{lower}. The most stringent bounds on the time variation of fundamental constants are for the the fine structure constant \cite{Martins:2017yxk}, from the onset of domination of dark energy domination one requires
%
\begin{equation}
\label{alch}
{\delta \alpha \big{/} \alpha} < 10^{-6}.
\end{equation}
To compute the variation of $\alpha$ precisely one needs to track the  evolution of the quintessence field and carry of canonical normalisation along its trajectory\footnote{See \cite{Burgess:2010bz} for such a computation (in inverse volume expansion) in the inflationary context.}, but quick estimate can be made by assuming that the volume of the compactification remains approximately constant and the displacement of the blow-up mode is of the order of the string scale. This gives ${V}  > 10^4$, which is much weaker than the condition obtained from the bounds on fifth forces in Eq. \pref{lower}.

\subsubsection{SM from D3-branes at a singularity}
\label{sec:SMSing}

Next, we analyse the case when the visible sector  degrees of freedom are located on D3-branes at a singularity; the geometrically separated light modulus will continue to be a blow-up. For D3-branes at a singularity, the gauge coupling is given by the dilaton; we shall be interested in the kinetic mixing of the the dilaton and the blow-up. Therefore, we begin by considering the \Kahler potential of the setup by including the universal $N=2$ supersymmetric  $\alpha'$ 
correction \cite{Becker:2002nn} as this induces the required mixing. The \Kahler potential is given by (see \cite{Conlon:2008wa}):
%
\begin{equation}
\label{singuni}
K = - 2 \log\left(\alpha \left(\tau_0^{3/2} - \gamma_2 \tau_2^{3/2}\right) + \frac{\xi s^{3/2}}{2}\right) - \log \left( S + \bar{S}\right) + \frac{\tau_1^2}{{V}} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\tau_0$ is the universal \Kahler modulus, $S = s + i C_0$ the axio-dilaton, $\tau_1$ the modulus associated with the singularity and $\tau_2$ the geometric blow-up. At the singular locus, it is easy to see that $\tau_1$ does not kinetically mix with any other other moduli, the \Kahler metric in the $\{\tau_0, s, \tau_2\}$ subspace can be written as
%
$$
  K_{ij} =  K_{ij}^{(0)} +  K_{ij}^{(1)}  +  K_{ij}^{(2)}  + . . .
$$
%
with
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(0)} = \begin{pmatrix}
A \epsilon^2 && 0 && 0 \\
0 && B  && 0 \\
0 && 0 && C \epsilon^{3/2}
\end{pmatrix} \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 && D \epsilon^{5/2} && E \epsilon^{5/2} \\
D \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0 \\
E \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0 
\end{pmatrix} \,, \qquad K_{ij}^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 && 0 && 0 \\
0 && 0 && F \epsilon^3 \\
0 && F \epsilon^3 && 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{4} \,, \qquad B = \frac{1}{4 s^2} \,, \qquad C =  \frac{3 \gamma_2}{8 \sqrt{\tau_2}} \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{9 \xi \sqrt{s}}{16 \alpha} \,, \qquad E = - \frac{9}{8} \gamma_2 \sqrt{\tau_2} \,, \qquad F = - \frac{9 \xi \gamma_2 \sqrt{s \tau_2}}{16 \alpha} \,.
\end{equation}
Using the same procedure as before, we get the basis change matrix to be:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationSMSing}
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} \epsilon} && \frac{9 \xi}{2 \alpha} \langle s\rangle^{7/2} \epsilon^{5/2} && - \frac{2 \sqrt{6}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{5/4} \epsilon^{1/4} \\
- \frac{3 \sqrt{3} \xi \langle s\rangle^{5/2}}{2 \alpha} \epsilon^{3/2} && 2 \langle s\rangle && \frac{3 \sqrt{3} \xi \gamma_2^{1/2}}{\sqrt{2} \alpha} \langle s\rangle^{5/2} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{3/4} \epsilon^{9/4} \\
2 \sqrt{3} \langle\tau_2\rangle && - \frac{9 \xi \gamma_2}{2 \alpha} \langle s\rangle^{7/2} \langle \tau_2\rangle^{1/2} \epsilon^{3} && \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3} \gamma_2^{1/2} \epsilon^{3/4}}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}

Note that the mixing of $s$ with $\tau_2$ (which determines the couplings of $\tau_2$ with gauge bosons) scales as $\epsilon^{9/4}$ which is much lower than the $\epsilon^{3/4}$ mixing that we had found for the corresponding quantity in the previous example (the mixing of $\tau_1$ with $\varphi_2$ in Eq. \pref{eq:SMfieldRotatedx}). Therefore, we turn to examining the case when the mixings arise from the inclusion of the leading loop corrections to the \Kahler potential in backgrounds with $N=1$ supersymmetry (instead of the universal $\alpha'$-correction considered above). The \Kahler potential takes the form:
%
%
\begin{equation}
\label{singloop}
K = - 2 \log\left(\alpha \left(\tau_0^{3/2} - \gamma_2 \tau_2^{3/2}\right)\right)   - \log \left( S + \bar{S}\right)+ \frac{\tau_1^2}{{V}} + { {\hat{C}  \tau^{1/2}_{2}}\over {\left(S + \bar{S}\right) \tau_{0}^{3/2}} }.
\end{equation}
%
The last term in Eq. \pref{singloop} encodes the effect of loop corrections. Explicit computations in toroidal examples  and generic  effective field theory arguments \cite{Berg:2005ja, Conlon:2006gv, Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp, Cicoli:2008va} show that such a term is generated when a D7-branes wraps the cycle $\tau_2$. More generally, such a correction can be generated in $N=1$ backgrounds with NS-NS and R-R fluxes.\footnote{The loop we consider scales as $\alpha'^2$, it is an open question whether loop corrections at order $\alpha'$ exist or not. See \cite{Cicoli:2018kdo} for a detailed discussion of the present status of understanding of loop corrections in type IIB compactifications.} The kinetic matrix in the $\{\tau_0, s, \tau_2\}$ basis can be written as
 %
 $$
     K_{ij} =  K_{ij}^{(0)} +  K_{ij}^{(1)}  +  K_{ij}^{(2)}  + . . .
 $$
 %
with
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(0)} = \begin{pmatrix}
A \epsilon^2  && 0 && 0 \\
 0 && B && 0  \\
0 && 0 && C \epsilon^{3/2}
\end{pmatrix} \,, \qquad
K_{ij}^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 && 0 && 0 \\
 0 && 0 && F \epsilon^{3/2} \\
0 && F \epsilon^{3/2} && 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0  && D \epsilon^{5/2} && E \epsilon^{5/2} \\
 D \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0 \\
E \epsilon^{5/2} && 0 && 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
where we defined
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{4} \,, \qquad B = \frac{1}{4 s^2} \,, \qquad C =  \frac{3 \gamma_2}{8 \sqrt{\tau_2}} \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D = {3 \hat{C} \sqrt{\tau_2} \over 16 s^2} \,, \qquad E = -{3 \hat{C} \over 32  s \sqrt{\tau_2}} - \frac{9 \gamma_2 \sqrt{\tau_2}}{8} \,, \qquad F = -{\hat{C} \over 16 s^2 \tau_2^{1/2}} \,.
\end{equation}
The basis change matrix takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationLoopEffects}
\mathcal{M} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} \epsilon} && \frac{3 \hat{C}}{2} \langle s \rangle \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2} \epsilon^{5/2} && - \left(\frac{\hat{C}}{\sqrt{6} \gamma_2^{3/2}} \frac{\langle\tau_2\rangle^{1/4}}{\langle s \rangle} + \frac{2 \sqrt{6}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{5/4}\right) \epsilon^{1/4} \\
-\frac{\sqrt{3} \hat{C}}{2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2} \epsilon^{3/2} && 2 \langle s \rangle && \frac{\hat{C}}{\sqrt{6} \gamma_2^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/4}} \epsilon^{3/4}\\
2 \sqrt{3} \langle\tau_2\rangle + \frac{\hat{C}}{2 \sqrt{3} \gamma_2 \sqrt{\langle s\rangle}} && -\frac{\hat{C}}{2} \frac{\langle s\rangle}{\langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}} \epsilon^{3/2} && \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3 \gamma_2}} \frac{\langle \tau_2\rangle^{1/4}}{\epsilon^{3/4}}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}

\noindent{\underline{{Couplings to Gauge Bosons}}}\\
In the case of SM at singularity, the gauge kinetic function is given by the axio-dilaton $S$, this translates to the coupling:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GaugeCouplingDil}
\mathcal{L} \supset  -\frac{s}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \,.
\end{equation}
%
In the case that the mixing is generated by the universal $\alpha'$ correction the basis change matrix in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationSMSing} leads to a coupling between $\varphi_2$ and the gauge bosons 
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset - \frac{\zeta \langle s\rangle^{5/2}}{\langle{V}\rangle^{3/2}}\, \varphi_2 F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a,\,\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\zeta = \frac{3 \sqrt{3} \xi \gamma_2^{1/2}}{4 \sqrt{2} \alpha} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{3/4} \,,
\end{equation}
%
On restoring units, this corresponds on a suppression scale 
%(including the power of s while quoting the suppression scale, as this might give a big effect)
%
\begin{equation}
\label{supr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} \frac{\langle{V}\rangle^{3/2}}{\langle s \rangle^{5/2}}.
\end{equation}
%
On the other hand, if the loops effects are responsible for the mixing, the basis change matrix in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationLoopEffects} gives the coupling between $\varphi_2$ and the gauge fields to be
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\zeta}{\langle{V}\rangle^{1/2}} \, \varphi_2 F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a,\,\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\zeta = \frac{\hat{C}}{\sqrt{6} \gamma_2^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/4}} \,,
\end{equation}
%
and $\varphi_2$ is the canonically normalized quintessence field. On restoring units, this corresponds to a suppression scale
%
\begin{equation}
\label{supr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} \langle{V}\rangle^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
%
\noindent{{\underline{Coupling to Matter Fields}}}\\
For matter fields arising from D3-branes at singularities, in the limit $\tau_0 \gg 1$, the \Kahler matter metric is given by $K_{\alpha \beta} = {V}^{-2/3}$ \cite{Conlon:2006tj, Aparicio:2008wh, Aparicio:2015psl}. On expanding the fields as $\tau_i = \langle \tau_i \rangle + \delta \tau_i$ one finds:
%
\begin{equation}
K_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{\delta_{\alpha \beta}}{\langle {V} \rangle^{2/3}} \left(1  - \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} + \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\langle {V} \rangle = \alpha \left(\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2} - \gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{3/2} \right)$.  This give the interaction term involving the electrons can be computed as
before, it turns out to be:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CouplingElectronSing}
\mathcal{L} \supset - m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \left(\frac{1}{2} \frac{\delta \tau_0}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\gamma_2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle \tau_0 \rangle^{3/2}} \delta \tau_2\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $m_e$ the electron mass. In the case that the mixing arises from the universal $\alpha'$ correction (the corresponding basis change is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationSMSing}) then the coupling between electrons and $\varphi_2$ is

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset \left(\frac{\sigma_0}{\langle {V} \rangle^{5/6}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} + \frac{\sigma_2}{\langle {V} \rangle^{1/2}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} \right) m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}}  \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{5/4} \,, \qquad \sigma_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \gamma_2^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{3/4} \,.
\end{equation}
%
On the other hand, if the loop effects are relevant (and the corresponding basis change matrix is in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationLoopEffects}) then the coupling between electrons
and $\varphi_2$ is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset - \left(\frac{\sigma_0}{\langle {V} \rangle^{5/6}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} - \frac{\sigma_2}{\langle {V} \rangle^{1/2}} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} \right) m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = \left(\frac{\hat{C}}{2 \sqrt{6} \gamma_2^{3/2}} \frac{\langle\tau_2\rangle^{1/4}}{\langle s \rangle} + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\gamma_2^{1/2}} \langle\tau_2\rangle^{5/4}\right) \,, \qquad \sigma_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \gamma_2^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^{3/4} \,.
\end{equation}
%

Before discussing the lower bounds on the volume that the above interactions imply, we would like to note that in the case that the mixings are induced by the universal $\alpha'$-correction, the field $\varphi_2$ couples to the gauge bosons and matter fermions with different strengths. The reason for this is simple: its coupling to the gauge bosons is determined by the mixing of $\tau_2$ to the dilaton, while its couplings to the matter fields are given by its mixings with the volume modulus. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:fifth}, the detailed phenomenology of the implications of such non-universal couplings for violations of the equivalence principle is yet to be developed. Our results give motivation for such an analysis.

\vspace{0.2 cm}

\noindent \underline{Bounds}\\
As mentioned above, in the case that the mixings are generated by the $\alpha'$ corrections the couplings are non-universal. It is natural to expect that the coupling to the gluons are the most relevant for the bounds \cite{Adelberger:2003zx} (they are also weaker than the couplings of matter fields in the case at hand).  Requiring that the gluon couplings satisfy the condition in Section \ref{sec:fifth}, i.e. $(d^c_{g})^2  < 10^{-12}$, one finds
%
\begin{equation}
  {V} \gtrsim 10^4/g_s^{5/3} \simeq 5 \times 10^5\,, \quad \text{in the case of mixing from the universal $\alpha'$-corrections} \,,
\end{equation}
where in the last step we have taken $g_s \simeq 0.1$. On the other hand, in the case that the mixing arises from the leading loop corrections we obtain the following constraint
%
\begin{equation}
  {V} \gtrsim 10^{12}.  \quad  
\end{equation}
%
Both bounds are strong, but our results illustrate the importance of having detailed knowledge of the structure of quantum corrections in any model for addressing fifth force bounds
 
\subsubsection{M-theory with single blow-up}
%
Next, we consider an example in M-theory compactified on a manifold of $G_2$ holonomy. The M-theory \Kahler potential is proportional to the $\log$ of the volume of the compactification expressed in terms of the three cycles volumes. For our purposes it will be sufficient to consider a toy example with two moduli - the volume $\phi_0$ and one blow-up $\phi_1$, with $\langle \phi_0 \rangle \gg \langle \phi_1 \rangle$. The modulus $\phi_1$ plays the role of the quintessence field, while $\phi_0$ sets the gauge coupling $\alpha_{\rm GUT}$. The \Kahler potential takes the form
%
$$
  K =  -3 \log \left(  \left( {   s_0 + \bar{s}_0 \over 2 } \right)^{7/3} -    \left(  {s_1 + \bar{s}_1  \over 2 } \right)^{7/3}  \right)  \,,
$$
%
where $\phi_0 = \rm{Re}(s_0)$ and $\phi_1 = \rm{Re}(s_1)$. The kinetic matrix in the limit $\phi_0 \gg \phi_1$ is
%
\begin{equation}
K_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
{ 7  \over 4 \phi_0^{2} }&& -{ 49 \phi_1^{4/3} \over 12 \phi_0^{10/3}}&&  \\
  -{ 49 \phi_1^{4/3} \over 12 \phi_0^{10/3}} &&{7 \phi_1^{1/3}\over 3 \phi_0^{7/3}}
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}%
%
the basis change matrix is easily obtained:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2 \langle \phi_0 \rangle}{\sqrt{7}} & \sqrt{\frac{7}{3}} \frac{\langle \phi_1 \rangle^{7/6}}{\langle \phi_0 \rangle^{1/6}} \\
- \frac{2 \sqrt{7} \langle \phi_1 \rangle^{4/3}}{3 \langle \phi_0 \rangle^{1/3}} & \sqrt{\frac{3}{7}} \frac{\langle \phi_0 \rangle^{7/6}}{\langle \phi_1 \rangle^{1/6}} \,.
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} 

\noindent{{\underline{Couplings to Gauge Bosons}}}\\
The gauge coupling is determined by a holomorphic term
%
\begin{equation}
\label{gc}
\mathcal{L} \supset - \frac{\phi_0}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Upon canonical normalisation of the fields, the coupling between the photon and $\varphi_2$ is 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MTheoryGaugeCoupling}
\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\sigma \varphi_1}{\langle{V}\rangle^{1/14} } F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a, \mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Sigma}
\sigma = - \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{\frac{7}{3}} \langle \phi_1 \rangle^{7/6}  \,.
\end{equation}
%
On restoring units, the interaction is suppressed by a scale 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{mthsupr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} {V}^{1/14}.
\end{equation}
%
Given the low power of ${V}$ in Eq. \pref{mthsupr}, $\varphi_2$ has essentially Planck suppressed couplings with gluons for realistic value of the volume; thus cannot be very light.



%\noindent \underline{Bounds}\\
%Just using Eq. \eqref{eq:MTheoryGaugeCoupling} and requiring that $d_g < 10^{-6}$ implies
%
%\begin{equation}
%  {V} \gtrsim 10^{84} \,.

\subsection{Fibre Models}

A large class of Calabi-Yaus are fibrations. Fibre moduli can have weaker-than-Planck suppressed interactions with open string degrees of freedom that are localised in the compactification, hence are interesting candidates for the being the quintessence scalar\footnote{The model in \cite{Cicoli:2012tz} uses a fibre modulus as the quintessence field. The model relies on the supersymmetric large extra-dimensions (SLED) proposal \cite{Aghababaie:2003wz}. See  \cite{Cicoli:2011yy} for a discussion of embedding of SLED in string theory and the associated challenges.}. 
 
\subsubsection{Standard Model at a geometric blow-up}
 
We begin by analysing the case where the light field is a fibre modulus and the visible sector is realised by a blow-up mode in the geometric regime. We will consider the simplest constructions where the \Kahler potential takes the form\footnote{For realisations in explicit Calabi-Yaus see \cite{Cicoli:2011it}.}:
\begin{equation}
\label{fib}
  K = -2 \log {V} = - 2 \log \left(\hat{{V}}  -  \gamma \tau_1^{3/2}\right) \,  \phantom{abc} { \text{with}}  \phantom{abc} \hat{{V}}  = \alpha \sqrt{\tau_2} \left( \tau_0 - \beta \tau_2 \right) \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\tau_0$ is the volume of the base, $\tau_1$ volume of the fibre, $\tau_2$ is the volume of the blow-up mode, and $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ are constants. For simplicity, in the following we will consider the case $\beta = 0$ (see \cite{Burgess:2016owb} for a recent discussion on such models in the context of fibre inflation). In the large volume limit $\tau_{0} \gg \tau_1, \tau_2$ the volume of the internal manifold is approximately: 
%
\begin{equation}
{V} \simeq \alpha \sqrt{\tau_2} \tau_0 \ . 
\end{equation}
%
Using the basis $\{\tau_2, {V}, \tau_1\}$ the kinetic matrix can be written as
\begin{equation}
K_{ij} = K^{(0)}_{ij} + K^{(1)}_{ij} \,,
\end{equation}
 where $\delta = {V}^{-1}$ and
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(0)} = \begin{pmatrix}
A & 0 & 0 \\
0 & B \delta^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & C \delta
\end{pmatrix} \,, \qquad
K_{ij}^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & D \delta & E \delta \\
D \delta & 0 & 0 \\
E \delta & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
and we have defined
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{8 \tau_2^2} \,, \qquad B = \frac{1}{2} \,, \qquad C = \frac{3 \alpha \gamma}{8 \sqrt{\tau_1}} \,, \qquad D = - \frac{1}{4 \tau_2} \,, \qquad E = - \frac{3 \alpha \gamma \sqrt{\tau_1}}{8 \tau_2} \,.
\end{equation}
The basis change matrix is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationFibre}
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle\tau_2\rangle & \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3} \langle \tau_2 \rangle & 2 \sqrt{\frac{2 \alpha \gamma}{3}} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{3/4} \langle \tau_2 \rangle \delta^{1/2} \\
- \frac{4}{3} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \delta & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\delta} & - \frac{4}{3} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3 \alpha \gamma}} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{5/4} \delta^{1/2}  \\
- 2 \alpha \gamma \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \delta & \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3} \langle \tau_1 \rangle & \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \langle\tau_1\rangle^{1/4}}{\sqrt{3 \alpha \gamma}} \frac{1}{\delta^{1/2}}
\end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{equation}


\noindent{{\underline{Couplings to Gauge Bosons}}}\\ From the basis change matrix in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationFibre} and using Eq. \eqref{gc} it is easy to see that the coupling between the gauge bosons and the quintessence field is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\zeta \varphi_2}{\langle{V}\rangle} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a,\,\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\zeta = - 2 \alpha \gamma \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \,.
\end{equation}
%
On restoring units, the interaction is suppressed by a scale 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{supr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} \langle{V}\rangle.
\end{equation}
%
\noindent{\underline{Couplings to Matter Fields}}\\ 
The effective coupling of electrons changes slightly with respect to the previous Section due to the different expression for the volume
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \left(-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta {V}}{\langle {V} \rangle} - \frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta \tau_1}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
which, after the basis change leads to 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset \left(\frac{\sigma_1}{\langle {V} \rangle^2} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} + \frac{\sigma_2}{\langle {V} \rangle} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} \right) m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_1 = \frac{4}{9} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \,, \qquad \sigma_2 = \frac{2 \alpha \gamma}{3} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\langle \tau_2 \rangle^2}{\langle \tau_1 \rangle^{1/2}} \,.
\end{equation}
%
\noindent{\underline{Bounds}}\\ 
The bounds inferred by requiring that $\left(d_g^c\right)^2 < 10^{-12}$ is
\begin{equation}
{V} \gtrsim 10^6 \,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Fibre Models with SM at Singularity}

Next, let us consider the case in which the light field continues to be a fibre modulus, but the visible sector fields are realised by branes at singularities. Incorporating the effects of the universal $\alpha'$-correction, the \Kahler potential takes the form
%
\begin{equation}
\label{fib}
  K = - 2 \log \left( {{V}} + \frac{\xi s^{3/2}}{2}\right) - \log\left(2s\right)  + \frac{\tau_1^2}{{V}} \,,
\end{equation}
with the volume as in Eq. \eqref{fib}. In the basis $\{\tau_2, {V}, s\}$, the kinetic matrix can be written as
%
$$
  K_{ij} = K_{ij}^{(0)} + K_{ij}^{(1)} + K_{ij}^{(2)} + ...
$$
%
with
\begin{equation}
K_{ij}^{(0)} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
A & 0 & 0 \\
0 & B \delta^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & C
\end{pmatrix} \,, \qquad
K_{ij}^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & D \delta & 0 \\
D \delta & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,, \qquad
K_{ij}^{(2)} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &  0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & F \delta^2 \\
0 & F \delta^2 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{8 \tau_2^2} \,, \qquad B = \frac{1}{2} \,, \qquad C = \frac{1}{4 s^2} \,, \qquad D = - \frac{1}{4 \tau_2} \,, \qquad F = \frac{3 \xi \sqrt{s}}{8} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The basis change matrix is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationFibreSing}
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle && \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3} \langle \tau_2 \rangle && \frac{6 \xi \langle s \rangle^{11/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle}{3 \langle s \rangle^2 - 2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2} \delta^3 \\
-\frac{4}{3} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \delta && \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\delta} && 3 \xi \langle s \rangle^{7/2} \delta^2 \\
\frac{4 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \frac{\xi \langle s \rangle^{5/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^4}{2 \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 - 3 \langle s \rangle^2} \delta^3 && - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \xi \langle s \rangle^{5/2} \delta && 2 \langle s \rangle
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
%
Note that the mixings induced between the dilaton and the fibre is rather small (it scales as $\delta^{3}$), this it is important to consider loop effects. Following \cite{Berg:2005ja, Conlon:2006gv, Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp, Cicoli:2008va}, we take the \Kahler potential to be\footnote{As in Section \label{sec:SMSing} we take the loop correction to be scaling as $\alpha'^{2}$. A correction scaling as $\alpha'$ if present will lead to stronger mixings, thus our results can be be considered as lower bounds.} 
%
\begin{equation}
K = - 2 \log \hat{{V}} - \log\left(2s\right) - \frac{\lambda_2}{s \tau_2} \,.
\end{equation}
%
 Using the basis $\{\tau_2, {V}, s\}$, in the regime $\tau_0 \gg \tau_f \gg 1$, the kinetic matrix can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
K_{ij} = K^{(0)}_{ij} + \epsilon_1 K^{(1)}_{ij} + \epsilon_2 K^{(2)}_{ij} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\epsilon_1 = \frac{1}{4 \tau_2^2 s^2}$, $\epsilon_2 = {V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_2 \ll \epsilon_1$. With
\begin{equation}
K^{(0)}_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
A & 0 & 0 \\
0 & B \epsilon_2^2 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & C
\end{pmatrix} \,, \quad
K^{(1)}_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & E \epsilon_1 \\
0 & 0 & 0  \\
E \epsilon_1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,, \quad
K^{(2)}_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & D \epsilon_2 & 0 \\
D \epsilon_2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{3}{8 \tau_2^2} \,, \quad B = \frac{1}{2} \,, \quad C = \frac{1}{4 s^2} \,, \quad D = -\frac{1}{4 \tau_2} \quad E = -\lambda_2 \,.
\end{equation}
%
The basis change matrix is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RotationFibreLoop}
{\cal M} =
\begin{pmatrix}
{2 \sqrt{2}  \tau_2 \over \sqrt{3} } &&  { 2 \sqrt{2} \tau_2 \over 3 } && {16 \lambda_2 \tau_2^2 s^3 \epsilon_1 \over {3s^2 - 2 \tau_2^2}}\\
-{ 4 \sqrt{2} \tau_2^2 \epsilon_2 \over 3 \sqrt{3} } && { \sqrt{2} \over \epsilon_2}  && - {16 \lambda_2 \tau_2 s^5 \epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 \over {3s^2 - 2 \tau_2^2}}\\
{16 \sqrt{2} \lambda_2 \tau_2^3 s^{2} \epsilon_1 \over {\sqrt{3} (2 \tau_2^2  - 3s^2)}}  && {2 \sqrt{2} \lambda_2 \over 3 \tau_2} && { 2s} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
Next, let us compute the couplings of $\varphi_2$ to gauge bosons and matter fields.

\noindent{{\underline{Couplings to Gauge Bosons}}}\\  In the case that the mixings are generated by the universal $\alpha'$ corrections, it is easy to see from the basis change matrix in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationFibreSing} and Eq. \eqref{eq:GaugeCouplingDil} that the coupling between the gauge bosons and $\varphi_2$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\zeta \varphi_2}{\langle{V}\rangle^3} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a,\,\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\zeta = - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\xi \langle s \rangle^{1/2} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^4}{3 - 2 \left(\frac{\langle \tau_2 \rangle}{\langle s \rangle}\right)^2} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Restoring units, the interaction is suppressed by the scale 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{supr}
  \Lambda \sim M_{\rm pl} \langle{V}\rangle^3.
\end{equation}
%
On the other hand, if the mixing is due to loop effects, as given in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationFibreLoop}, then the coupling takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CouplingsLoopFibre}
\mathcal{L} \supset \zeta \varphi_2 F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a,\,\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{lmixdanger}
\zeta = - {4 \sqrt{2} \lambda_2 \tau_2^3 s^{2} \epsilon_1 \over {\sqrt{3} (2 \tau_2^2  - 3s^2)}} \ .
\end{equation}
%
\noindent{\underline{Couplings to Matter Fields}}\\ 
%
The couplings to electrons and other matter fermions can computed as in Section \ref{sec:SMSing}. One finds
%
  \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \left(-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\delta {V}}{\langle {V} \rangle}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
After making use of the  basis change matrices in Eq. \eqref{eq:RotationFibreSing} and \label{eq:RotationFibreLoop} this leads couplings
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MatterCouplingFibreSing}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset \frac{\sigma_1}{\langle {V} \rangle^2} \frac{\varphi_2}{M_{\rm p}} \, m_e \overline{\hat{e}} \hat{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where
%
\begin{equation}
\label{fsuni}
\sigma_1 = \frac{4}{9} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \langle \tau_2 \rangle^2 \,.
\end{equation}
%
for both the cases.

\noindent{\underline{Bounds}}\\ 
As in Sec. \ref{sec:SMSing}, the couplings to matter and to gauge bosons have different strengths. As discussed earlier, a detailed
analysis of the bounds for such cases is yet to be done. In the case that the mixings are generated by the universal $\alpha'$ correction; imposing that the condition $\left(d_g^c\right)^2 < 10^{-12}$ (as one expects the gluon couplings to be most relevant for the bounds\footnote{The gluon couplings are also weaker than the matter couplings for the case at hand, this the condition used is conservative.}), one finds ${V} \gtrsim 10^2 $. The condition is not very strong. Thus it is important to check the effect that loops  have. From Eq. \pref{lmixdanger}, one sees that in at generic points in the moduli space the loop effects general a coupling which has no volume suppression, preventing $\varphi_2$ from light. For large $\tau_2$ the coupling scales as $\tau_2^{-1}$, even in the case $\tau_2 \sim {V}^{2/3} \gg 1$, one would obtain strong bounds.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Before closing this Section we would like to note that one can compare the strength of mixings obtained by us to those obtained by diagonalising both the kinetic and mass matrices \cite{Conlon:2007gk, Cicoli:2010ha} (which were done in the presence of a specific potential). In all cases, the mixings obtained by us are of lower or equal strength. This is in keeping with the expectation that our results should be considered as lower bounds on the strength of the interactions.

\section{Kinetic Mixing of $U(1)$ fields:}
\label{sec:uone}

In this Section, we will consider the situation where the quintessence scalar does not couple directly to the Standard Model photon, but
has direct couplings to a hidden sector photon and analyse the implications that kinetic mixing between the $U(1)s$ has for quintessence. We take the tree level Lagrangian to be of the form:

 %
$$
  \mathcal{L}  \supset  - {1 \over 4 e^2} F^{1}_{\mu \nu} F^{1 \,\mu \nu} -  {1 \over 4 } h \left({ \phi / M_{\rm pl}}\right)F^2_{\mu \nu} F^{2 \, \mu \nu}
$$
%      
where $F_{\mu \nu}^{1}$ is the electromagnetic field strength and $F_{\mu \nu}^{2}$ is the field strength of associated with a gauge field which is in the sector of the quintessence field $(\phi)$. We will confine our analysis to the case where there is a single hidden photon, the arguments easily generalise to cases with multiple hidden photons. While geometric separation naturally leads to such a structure in the tree level kinetic terms, but this is not preserved once quantum effects are incorporated. Integrating out heavy bi-fundamental string states leads to kinetic mixing between gauge fields \cite{Holdom:1985ag, Dienes:1996zr, Abel:2008ai}. In general, if the gauge couplings of the 
 two sectors are $g_{1}$ and $g_2$ generic estimates of the loop factors give the strength of the kinetic mixing to be
%
\bel{strmix}
    \lambda \approx {1 \over 12 \pi^2 }g_1 g_2.
\end{equation}
%
Incorporating the couplings to matter, the Lagrangian takes the form
%
\bel{matcoup}
    {\cal L} \supset - \frac14 \, Z_{ab} F^a_{\mu\nu} F^{b\,\mu\nu}
    - {1 \over 2} M^2_{ab} A^a_{\mu} A^{b\,\mu} - j^\mu_a A^a_\mu \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu$
and $j^\mu_a$  are the currents to which each gauge boson
couples. We take the kinetic and mass matrices to be of the form
%
\bel{matri}
    Z = \left(%
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 && \lambda \\
    \lambda && 1 \\
    \end{array}%
    \right) \qquad \hbox{and}\qquad
    M^2 = \left(%
    \begin{array}{cc}
    m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 & \mu^2 \\
    \mu^2 & ^2 \\
    \end{array}%
    \right)
\end{equation}
%
Diagonalising the kinetic and mass matrices, the Lagrangian becomes:
%
\bel{lfinal}
    {\cal L} = -\frac14 \, {\cal F}^a_{\mu\nu} {\cal F}^{\mu\nu}_a
    - \frac12 \, \left( M_+^2 {\cal A}^+_\mu {\cal A}^\mu_+
    + M_-^2 {\cal A}^-_\mu {\cal A}_-^\mu \right)
    + {N^a}_b j^\mu_a {\cal A}^b_\mu \,,
\end{equation}
%
where 
%
\bel{nmatrix}
    N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} \left(%
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    \cos(\theta+\hat{\alpha}) && -\sin(\theta + \hat{\alpha}) \\
    \sin(\theta-\hat{\alpha}) && \cos(\theta - \hat{\alpha}) \\
    \end{array}%
    \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
where the angles $\theta$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ are 
%
\begin{equation}
    \sin 2\hat{\alpha} = \lambda \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad
    \tan 2\theta = \frac{2\mu^2 - (m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 + ^2)
    \lambda}{(m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 - ^2) \sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The mass eigenvalues $M_{\pm}$ are
%
\begin{equation}
    M^2_{\pm} = \frac{m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 + ^2 - 2 \lambda \mu^2
    \pm \Delta}{2(1 - \lambda^2)} \,,
\end{equation}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta^2 = (m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 - ^2)^2 + 4\mu^4 - 4\lambda \mu^2 (m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2
    + ^2) + 4\lambda^2 m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 ^2 \,.
\end{equation}
%

Now, let us analyse the implications this has for time dependence of couplings in the Standard Model sector. 


\begin{itemize}

\item If $m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}^2 = \mu^2 = 0$, then one of the gauge fields  (corresponding to the photon) is
massless. The other gauge field has mass $M_+^2 =
^2/(1-\lambda^2)$ . Also $\sin 2\theta = \sin 2\hat{\alpha} = \lambda$, as a result of this only the massive (hidden) vector acquires a coupling to both currents
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:masslessmassivemixing}
    {\cal L}_{\rm int} = j_1^\mu {\cal
    A}^-_\mu + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}
    \left( j_2^\mu - \lambda
    j_1^\mu \right) {\cal A}^+_\mu \,.
\end{equation}
%
The couplings of the massless photon are unaffected by the mixing. Hence, a time variation of the hidden sector gauge coupling due to a rolling quintessence scalar does not affect the fine structure constant.


\item Next let us  $M^2_{ab} = 0$. In this case,  one can take $\theta = 0$,  $N = Z^{-1/2}$;
both gauge bosons in general couple to both currents
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:masslessBoson}
    {\cal L}_{\rm int} = \frac{\cos\hat{\alpha}}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}
    \left( j_1^\mu {\cal A}^-_\mu
    + j_2^\mu {\cal A}^+_\mu \right)
    - \frac{\sin\hat{\alpha}}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}
    \left( j_1^\mu {\cal A}^+_\mu
    + j_2^\mu {\cal A}^-_\mu \right) \,,
\end{equation}
%
with $\sin^2\hat{\alpha} = \frac12 \left[ 1 - \sqrt{1-\lambda^2}
\right]$ and $\cos^2\hat{\alpha} = \frac12 \left[ 1 + \sqrt{1 -
\lambda^2} \right]$ .
%
Note that, in this case the coupling of the visible sector photon ${\cal{A}}_{\mu}^{1}$  to $j^{\mu}_1$ {\it depends} on the 
mixing parameter. Thus, a change in the mixing parameter caused due to a rolling quintessence scalar leads to time variation in the fine structure constant. For small $\lambda$, $\cos \hat{\alpha} \sim 1 - {\lambda^2 \over 8}$. Thus we have $ { \delta \alpha / \alpha} =  {\delta(\lambda^2) \over 4}$. Making use of the expression for for strength of the mixing parameter in Eq. \pref{strmix} 
%
$$
  { \delta \alpha \over \alpha} \simeq  {\alpha \delta( g^2_{\rm hidden} ) \over  144 \pi^3}
$$
%
Note that even for an ${\mathcal{O}}(1)$ differential variation of the hidden sector coupling, the differential variation in the fine structure constant is within the bounds ${\delta \alpha / \alpha} <  10^{-6} $.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the rolling quintessence scalar which couples to a hidden sector gauge field can lead to a time variation of the fine structure constant only if the hidden gauge field is massless\footnote{The bounds on dark radiation disfavour the presence of such massless gauge fields.}. Even in this case, this there is no tension with the 
bound for generic estimates of the loop factors.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

Geometric separation in the extra-dimensions provides a mechanism to have fields which interact with the visible sector with weaker-than-Planck suppressed couplings. We have examined the strength of such interactions in cases in which they arise due to kinetic mixing of scalars and gauge fields. In our explicit analysis of kinetic mixing of scalars we considered the prototypical settings to have geometric separation between a light modulus and the Standard Model: the modulus was 
taken to be a geometric blow-up modulus or a fibre modulus, while  the Standard Model was realised from D7-branes wrapping another blow-up mode or from branes at singularities. In all cases, we found that the bounds from fifth forces imposed interesting constraints. We would now like to make some general remarks.

From our computations in Section \ref{sec:kin}, it is easy to see that a non-zero $K_{\tau_q \tau_{\rm sm}}$ (where $\tau_q$ denotes a light scalar and $\tau_{\rm sm}$ a modulus that sets the value of the Standard Model couplings) entry in the \Kahler metric leads to
interactions between $\tau_q$ and the Standard Model sector. In cases where  this entry is vanishing, interactions will in general  be ``mediated" by the volume modulus. Since the wavefunction of the  volume modulus has support in all regions of the extra-dimensions, all moduli are expected to have direct interactions with it leading to non-zero  $K_{\tau_b \tau_{q}}$ and $K_{\tau_b \tau_{\rm sm}}$ entries in the kinetic matrix. Now, even if the $K_{\tau_q \tau_{\rm sm}}$ entry is non-zero, diagonalising the kinetic matrix will in general involve a basis change which leads to a mixing between $\tau_{\rm q}$ and $\tau_{\rm sm}$ (as can be seen from second-order perturbation theory in the off-diagonal entries of the \Kahler metric). An interesting exception to this is the case when $\tau_q$ is
exactly at the singular locus. At leading order, the \Kahler potential for the field is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{singk}
   K \supset { \tau_q^2 \over {V} }.
\end{equation}
%
Note that $K_{\tau_q \tau_b}$ vanishes at $\tau_q = 0$, thus interactions ``mediated by the volume" are absent. This
vanishing is similar in spirit to the mechanisms in \cite{Damour:1994ya, Damour:2002mi, Brax:2009kd} to avoid couplings between moduli and Standard Model fields. Interactions would be induced by terms in the \Kahler potential which are linear in $\tau_q$, such as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{orbmix}
   K \supset {\tau_q \tau_{\rm sm}  \over {V}^{p}} \ .
\end{equation}
%
It should be possible to determine the power of volume $(p)$ that appears in Eq. \eqref{orbmix} by performing calculations in the orbifold limit. If examples with high values of $p$ can be found (see \cite{Kobayashi:2011cw, Maharana:2011wx} for symmetry considerations that can lead to high $p$), they would provide interesting settings to evade bounds from fifth forces. Although, if the field is to be used to drive quintessence one would have to explain why the scalar is  exactly at or very close to the singular point today. More generally, there are various mechanisms  to realise sequestered sectors. Fields localised in warped throats interact weakly with degrees of freedom in the bulk of the compactification. In addition to suppression by powers of the volume\footnote{We note that the wavefuction of the volume modulus becomes non-uniform in the presence of warping, with lower support in warped throats \cite{Giddings:2005ff, Frey:2006wv}.}, the interactions are suppressed by the warp factor at the bottom of the throat. The
construction of \cite{Panda:2010uq} uses an axionic field in a $10^{-3} \, \rm {eV}$ warped throat to drive quintessence\footnote{Axions do not mediate long-range forces between macroscopic bodies, fifth forces are trivially satisfies for light axions, \cite{Panda:2010uq} used warping to lower the scale of the quintessence potential.}. As discussed in detail in \cite{Panda:2010uq}, there are many model building challenges that can arise in constructions with such long throats: the cosmological moduli problem, the danger of formation of black brane horizons and overproduction of dark radiation. These have to be addressed in detail for each model separately. Another way to evade the bounds from fifth forces is to construct models where  screening effects  \cite{Khoury:2010xi, Vainshtein:1972sx, Brax:2004qh, Brax:2004qh, ArmendarizPicon:2000dh, Hinterbichler:2010es, Martin:2008qp} are relevant. See \cite{Brax:2006np} for a discussion of possible embedding of the chameleon mechanism in supergravity\footnote{For general discussions of quintessence model building in supergravity see e.g. \cite{Brax:1999gp, Copeland:2000vh, Chiang:2018jdg, Kallosh:2002gf}.}.
Finally, we would like to mention that in arriving at the lower bounds on the volume we have assumed that there is no alignment between
the kinetic and mass matrices so that their effects precisely cancel when the interactions between the light modulus and the visible sector 
are computed (as described in detail in Section \ref{sec:kin}). It will be interesting to explore if it is possible to get such alignments in string
compactifications naturally.

Next, we would like to discuss another interesting feature revealed by  our study. In many of the examples in Section \ref{sec:kin}, we have found the strengths of the couplings of the geometrically separated modulus to the visible sector  fields to be non-universal, i.e. it couples to the gauge bosons and matter fermions with  different strengths. The implications of such couplings for violations of the equivalence principle have not been studied in detail in the literature. It is important to develop the detailed phenomenology of such models as in \cite{Kap}, starting from the RG running of the high scale Lagrangian. We hope to pursue this direction in the future.

Our results can also be used to quantify the fine-tuning necessary for stability against quantum corrections involving visible sector loops. A rough estimate of the effect of visible sector loops on the mass of the quintessence field can be obtained as in \cite{Adelberger:2003zx}, for a theory  where the couplings between the quintessence field and the visible sector fields are suppressed by the scale $\Lambda$, quantum corrections give
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MassCorrection}
\delta m_q^2 \sim {\Lambda_{\rm UV}^4 \over \Lambda^2},
\end{equation}
%
where $m_q$ is the mass of the quintessence field and $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ is the cut-off scale. For the example involving two blow-up moduli discussed in Section \ref{twoblow}, if the volume is taken to be ${V} \sim 10^{12}$ (so that the fifth force bounds are evaded), Eq. \pref{eq:MassCorrection} yields $\delta m_q \sim 1 \ {\rm GeV}$, where we have taken supersymmetry to be broken at a high scale (i.e there are no cancellations amongst visible sector loops). This is forty orders of magnitude greater than the physical mass. Similar estimates can be performed for the other examples and scenarios with low scale supersymmetry\footnote{Supersymmetry together with weaker-than-Planck suppressed interactions can lead to unexpectedly light scalars in extra-dimensional theories \cite{uber}.}. For more accurate quantifications and an understanding of the functional fine-tuning involved, one can start from the couplings derived in  Section~\ref{sec:kin} and make use of the formalism developed in \cite{Garny:2006wc}.




\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

Moduli fields play a central role in string phenomenology. For Planck suppressed interactions between  moduli and  the visible sector,  fifth force bounds  prevent them from being light and the bounds from time variation of fundamental constant prevent them from being cosmologically active. Geometric separation can lead to weaker-than-Planck suppressed couplings between moduli and the visible sector. We have examined the strength of the interactions between such geometrically separated moduli and the Standard Model sector induced by kinetic mixings. Our results should provide lower bounds on the strength of such interactions unless the mass and kinetic matrices are aligned so as to cancel each others effects or screening effects are relevant. If the modulus is taken to be massless (which is a good approximation if it is to drive quintessence) fifth force bounds lead to interesting lower bounds on the volume. In the context of quintessence, our results reiterate the importance of constructing models where all moduli are stabilised, so that all the couplings of the field driving  quintessence can be computed explicitly and the compatibility with fifth force bounds can be examined. More generally, the next generation of experiments plan to improve on the tests of the equivalence principle by two orders of magnitude (see e.g. \cite{Nobili:2018eym}) - the time is ripe to develop a detailed understanding of couplings between moduli fields and the visible sector fields in string theory models.

In this section we give a review\footnote{For more details see for example~\cite{Barnaby:2011vw,Barnaby:2011qe,Linde:2012bt}.} of the case of a \emph{pseudoscalar} inflaton $\phi$ coupled to Abelian gauge fields. In particular we show that a generic higher-dimensional coupling between the inflaton and the gauge fields introduces an instability in the theory, which leads to an exponential production of the gauge fields~\cite{Turner:1987bw, Garretson:1992vt, Anber:2006xt}. Interestingly this effect induces a back-reaction both on the background dynamics~\cite{Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2011qe,Barnaby:2011vw} and on the perturbations~\cite{Anber:2012du,Linde:2012bt}, leading to a wide set of observational consequences. Let us consider the action for a pseudo-scalar inflaton $\phi$, which is coupled to a certain number $\mathcal{N}$ of Abelian gauge fields $A_\mu^a$ (associated to $U(1)$ gauge symmetries,\footnote{Alternatively, these may be associated with a $SU({\cal N})$ symmetry in the weak coupling limit.} i.e.\ $a = \{1,2,...,\mathcal{N}\}$)~\cite{Turner:1987bw,Garretson:1992vt, Anber:2006xt,Anber:2012du,Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2011qe,Barnaby:2011vw,Linde:2012bt,Domcke:2016bkh}:\footnote{The metric has signature $(-,+,+,+)$ and $m_p \simeq 2.4 \cdot 10^{18}\,$~GeV denotes the reduced Planck mass.} 
\begin{equation}
\label{review:action_pseudoscalar}
\mathcal{S}= \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{|g|} \left[m_p^2 \frac{R}{2} -\frac{1}{2} \, \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial^\mu \phi - V(\phi) - \frac{1}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F_a^{\mu \nu} - \frac{\alpha^a}{4 \Lambda} \phi F^a_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}_a^{\mu \nu} \right ]\ ,
\end{equation}
where $V(\phi)$ is the inflaton potential, $F^a_{\mu \nu} $ ($\tilde{F}^{\mu \nu}_{a}$) are the (dual\footnote{The dual field-strength tensor is defined as $\tilde{F}_a^{\mu \nu} \equiv \tilde{F}_{\rho \sigma}^a \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}/(2 \sqrt{-g})$,
where $\epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}$ is the Levi-Civita tensor.}) field-strength tensors for the gauge fields, $\Lambda$ is a mass scale (that suppresses the higher-dimensional scalar-vector coupling) and $\alpha^a$ are the dimensionless coupling constants of the Abelian gauge fields. In the following we consider $\alpha^a = \alpha$ for all $a$. Throughout this paper, the effective mass scale $\Lambda/\alpha$ will take sub-Planckian values, 
 as required for a reasonable effective field theory. Typical values found e.g.\ in Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh} for phenomenologically interesting scenarios lie in the range $\Lambda/\alpha \simeq 0.01 - 0.03 \, m_p$.
However, we stress that contrary to natural inflation models~\cite{Freese:1990rb}, we do not impose that this scale simultaneously sets the scale of the scalar potential or of the field excursion during inflation. A discussion on how Eq.~\eqref{review:action_pseudoscalar} may arise in the context of field theory, supergravity or string theory is provided in App.~\ref{sec:axions}.


\subsection{Background dynamics}
\label{review:background}
In order to describe the dynamics we can start by computing the background equations of motion for the inflaton $\phi(t)$ and for the gauge fields $A_\mu^a(t,x)$. Without loss of generality, we proceed by assuming $ \phi > 0, \ V_{,\phi}(\phi)>0, \ \dot{\phi} < 0$, and we choose to describe the problem in the Coulomb gauge ($A_0^a = 0$, $\partial^\mu A_\mu^a(t,x) = 0$). Under these assumptions the equations of motion can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
\label{review:eq_motion}
\ddot \phi + 3 H \dot{\phi} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} = \frac{\alpha}{2\Lambda} \frac{\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}}{\sqrt{|g|}} \langle \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial_\rho A_\sigma \rangle & \equiv \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle \ ,\\
\frac{d^2}{d \tau^2}\vec{A}^a - \vec{\nabla}^2 \vec{A}^a - \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \frac{\textrm{d} \phi}{\textrm{d} \tau} \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}^a & = 0 \ , \label{review:eq_motionA}
\end{align}
where dots are used to denote derivatives with respect to cosmic time $t$, primes are used to denote derivatives with respect to $\tau$ (conformal time defined as $\textrm{d}t \equiv a \, \textrm{d}\tau$), $\vec{\nabla}$ is the $3$-dimensional flat space gradient operator, the brackets $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denote a spatial mean and the vectors $\vec{E}^a$ and $\vec{B}^a$ are the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' fields associated with the fields $A_\mu^a(t,x)$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{review:electric_magnetic}
	\vec{E}^a \equiv -\frac{1 }{a^2} \frac{\textrm{d} \vec{A}^a}{\textrm{d} \tau} = -\frac{1 }{a} \frac{\textrm{d} \vec{A}^a}{\textrm{d} t} \ , \qquad \qquad  \vec{B}^a \equiv \frac{1}{a^2} \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}^a  \ .
\end{equation}
In order to completely specify the dynamics we also have to compute the Friedmann equation which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{review:friedmann}
3 H^2 m_p^2 = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) + \frac{1}{2} \langle \vec{E}^{a \, 2}  +  \vec{B}^{a \, 2}\rangle  \ .
\end{equation}
Clearly a general analytical solution for Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motion}, Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motionA}, and Eq.~\eqref{review:friedmann} does not exist. However, assuming $\dot{ \phi} $ to be slowly varying (which is a reasonable assumption during slow-roll inflation) we can find an analytical solution for Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motionA}. By substituting this solution into Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motion} and Eq.~\eqref{review:friedmann} we can then study the back-reaction on the system.

In order to solve Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motionA} we start by performing a spatial Fourier transform and, taking $\vec{k}$ to be parallel to the x-axis $\hat{x}$, expressing the gauge fields in terms of the two helicity vectors\footnote{The two helicity vectors $\vec{e}_{\pm}$ are defined as $\vec{e}_{\pm} = (\hat{y} \pm i \hat{z})/\sqrt{2}$. It is crucial to notice that using the helicity vectors we get $\vec{k} \times \vec{A}^a =  A^{a}_{\pm} \vec{k} \times \vec{e}_{\pm} = \mp i A^{a}_{\pm} |\vec{k}| \vec{e}_{\pm}$.} as $\vec{A}^a = A_{+}^a \vec{e}_{+} + A_{-}^a \vec{e}_{-}$, the equation of motion for the gauge fields reads:
\begin{equation}
\label{review:eq_motionAfourier}
  \frac{\textrm{d}^2  A^{a}_{\pm}(\tau,\vec{k})}{\textrm{d} \tau^2}  + \left[ k^2 \pm 2\, k  \, \frac{\xi}{\tau} \right]A^{a}_{\pm}(\tau,\vec{k}) =  \ 0 \ , 
  \end{equation}
where we have introduced the parameter $\xi$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
\xi \equiv \frac{\alpha \, |\dot{\phi}|}{2 \, \Lambda \, H} \ .
\label{review:xi}
\end{equation}
Notice that Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motionAfourier} describes a tachyonic instability for the $A_+$ mode. In particular for the modes with $(8 \, \xi)^{-1} \lesssim k/(aH) \lesssim 2 \, \xi$,  $A_+$ can be expressed as~\cite{Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2010vf,Barnaby:2011vw}:
\begin{equation}
A_+^a \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\, k}} \left( \frac{k}{2 \,  \xi \, a \, H}\right)^{1/4} e^{ \pi \xi - 2 \sqrt{2 \xi k/(a H)}} \ ,
\end{equation}
so that the terms $\langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle$ and $\langle \vec{E}^{a \, 2} + \vec{B}^{a \, 2} \rangle$ appearing in Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motion} and in Eq.~\eqref{review:friedmann} can be expressed as:\footnote{These expressions only hold for $\xi \gtrsim 1$. For the correct expressions for small values of $\xi$ see~\cite{Anber:2009ua,Pieroni:2016gdg}.}
\begin{equation}
\langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle \simeq \mathcal{N} \cdot \   2.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^4} e^{2 \pi \xi} \ , \quad \frac{1}{2} \langle \vec{E}^{a \, 2} + \vec{B}^{a \, 2} \rangle  \simeq \mathcal{N} \cdot \   1.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^3} e^{2 \pi \xi} \ .
\end{equation}
It is possible to show (see for example~\cite{Barnaby:2011vw}) that while the back-reaction on the Friedmann equation is fairly negligible throughout the whole evolution, the back-reaction on the equation of motion for the scalar field cannot be neglected in the last part of the evolution. In particular this back-reaction introduces an additional friction term that has an exponential dependence on $\xi$. As this parameter is proportional to $\dot{\phi}$, it typically increases towards the end of inflation in single-field inflation models. Correspondingly the new friction term may be negligible at CMB scales while significantly slowing down the last part of the evolution. As explained in~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}, this effect induces a shift in the region of the potential that can be probed with CMB observations. It is crucial to stress that the gauge fields are not changing the total number $N \equiv - \int H \textrm{d}t$ of e-foldings (i.e.\ the CMB is still generated at $N_\text{CMB} \simeq 60$ in the complete evolution) but rather they slow down the increase of $\xi \sim |\dot{\phi}/H|$. 


\subsection{Scalar and tensor power spectra}
\label{review:perturbations}
The gauge fields do not only affect the background dynamics but they also modify the equation of motion for the perturbations. In particular they induce a source term both for scalar and tensor perturbations leading to an exponential amplification of the spectra at small scales. 

Let us start by discussing the modified scalar power spectrum.\footnote{More details on the derivation of these formulas are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-minimal}, where we also discuss the generalization to a model where the inflaton is non-minimally coupled to gravity.} As a first step we express the inflaton field as $\phi(\vec{x},t)=\phi(t) + \delta \phi(\vec{x},t)$ and by solving the linearized equation of motion for $\delta \phi(\vec{x},t)$ (for details see~\cite{Anber:2006xt,Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2010vf,Barnaby:2011vw,Barnaby:2011qe}) we can express the scalar power spectrum $\Delta^2_s(k)$ as~\cite{Linde:2012bt,Domcke:2016bkh}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta^2_s(k) = \Delta^2_s(k)_\text{vac} + \Delta^2_s(k)_\text{gauge} = \left(\frac{H^2}{2 \pi |\dot{\phi}|}\right)^2 + \left( \frac{\alpha \langle \vec{E}^a\cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle/ \sqrt\mathcal{N}}{3 \Lambda b H \dot{\phi}} \right)^2 \ ,
\label{review:scalar}
\end{equation}
where we have defined $b$ as:
\begin{equation}
b \equiv 1 - 2 \, \pi \, \xi \,  \frac{\alpha \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle}{3 \Lambda H \dot{\phi}}  \ .
\end{equation} 
As $\langle \vec{E}^a\cdot \vec{B}^a \rangle$ grows exponentially with $\xi$, the second term of Eq.~\eqref{review:scalar} (i.e.\ the gauge-field induced contribution) is typically negligible at CMB scales (where the stringent CMB constraints essentially require $\Delta^2_s(k) \simeq \Delta^2_s(k)_\text{vac}$) but may dominate over the first term at small scales. In particular it is possible to show that in the gauge-field dominated regime (i.e.\ typically in the last part of inflation) the spectrum is well approximated by~\cite{Linde:2012bt,Domcke:2016bkh}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta^2_s(k ) \simeq \frac{1}{\mathcal{N} (2 \pi \xi)^2} \ .
\label{review:scalar_strong}
\end{equation}
Notice that in presence of several $U(1)$s the power spectrum is suppressed at small scales. Moreover, the presence of the gauge fields leads to the generation of equilateral non-Gaussianities~\cite{Anber:2012du}. As a consequence, the non-observation of non-Gaussianities at CMB scales~\cite{Ade:2015lrj,Ade:2015ava} can be used to set constraints on these models. In particular, this implies $\left. \xi\right|_{\text{CMB}} \lesssim 2.5$, where $\left. \xi\right|_{\text{CMB}}$ is the value of $\xi$ at CMB scales~\cite{Barnaby:2011vw,Barnaby:2011qe,Anber:2012du,Barnaby:2010vf,Linde:2012bt}.

In order to compute the tensor spectrum $\Delta^2_{t}$ we start with the equation of motion for the traceless transverse part of the metric perturbations $h_{ij}(\vec{x},t)$, given by the linearized Einstein equation:\footnote{For details on the derivation of this equation see~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}.}
 \begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{d}^2 h_{ij}}{\textrm{d} \tau^2} + 2 \frac{\textrm{d} \ln a}{\textrm{d} \tau} \frac{\textrm{d} h_{ij}}{\textrm{d} \tau} - \vec{\nabla}^2 h_{ij} = \frac{2}{m_p^2} \Pi_{ij}^{\mu \nu} T_{\mu \nu} \ ,
\label{review:linearized_einstein}
 \end{equation}
where $\Pi^{ij}_{\mu \nu}$ is the transverse, traceless projector and $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the matter energy-momentum tensor (which acts as a source for GWs). By solving this equation we obtain $\Delta^2_{t,L}$ and $\Delta^2_{t,R}$, power spectra for the two polarizations\footnote{In order to decompose $h_{ij}(\vec{x},t)$ in terms of the two polarizations of the GW we can use the projector $\Pi_{ij,L/R} = e_{i, \, \mp} e_{j, \, \mp}$.} $(L,R)$ of the GWs. The tensor power spectrum $\Delta^2_{t}$ (given by the sum of the spectra for the two polarizations) can then be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{GW} \equiv \frac{\Omega_{R,0}}{24} \Delta^2_{t} \simeq \frac{1}{12} \Omega_{R,0} \left(  \frac{H}{ \pi \, m_p } \right)^2 \left(1 + 4.3 \cdot 10^{-7} \mathcal{N} \frac{H^2}{ m_p^2 \, \xi^6} e^{4 \pi \xi}\right)\ ,
\label{review:OmegaGW}
\end{equation} 
where $\Omega_{R,0} = 8.6 \cdot 10^{-5}$ is used to denote the radiation energy density today. Similarly to the case of the scalar power spectrum, the gauge-field sourced term (i.e.\ the second term in the parenthesis on the r.h.s. of Eq.~\eqref{review:OmegaGW}) is typically negligible at CMB scales and dominates over the first term at small scales (i.e.\ in the last part of inflation). It is also crucial to stress that the second term in Eq.~\eqref{review:OmegaGW} is only sourced by one of the two polarizations. As a consequence the GW signal that is generated during the last part of the evolution is expected to be strongly chiral. Chirality is a peculiar feature for a GW background and if detected\footnote{For details on methods to detect the chirality of GW background see~\cite{Crowder:2012ik}.} it would point to the existence of a parity violating source. In the framework of standard general relativity axion inflation is one of the simplest models which implement this parity violation.

As in the context of direct GW observations it is customary to express quantities in terms of the frequency $f = k / (2 \pi)$, it is useful to introduce the relation between $f$ and the number of e-foldings $N$~\cite{Barnaby:2011qe,Domcke:2016bkh}:
\begin{equation}
N = N_\text{CMB} + \ln \frac{k_\text{CMB}}{0.002 \text{ Mpc}^{-1}} - 44.9 - \ln\frac{f}{10^2 \text{ Hz}} \ ,
\label{review:Nf}
\end{equation}
where $k_\text{CMB} = 0.002 \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ and $N_\text{CMB} \simeq 50 - 60$. Following the convention used throughout this work, the number of e-foldings $N$ decreases during inflation, reaching $N=0$ at the end of inflation and we will set $N_\text{CMB} = 60$.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The high energy regime of string theory remains a mysterious place.
The direct approach to study this limit is to examine the scattering or 
decay of highly excited strings (see, for example,~\cite{Gross:1987kza, Gross:1987ar, Amati:1987wq, Amati:1987uf, Amati:1990xe, Mitchell:1988qe, Gross:1989ge, Amati:1999fv, Manes:2001cs, Manes:2003mw, Manes:2004nd, Veneziano:2004er, Chen:2005ra, Giddings:2007bw, Giddings:2011xs, Hindmarsh:2010if, Skliros:2011si, Skliros:2013pka} or more recently~\cite{Gross:2021gsj, Rosenhaus:2021xhm, Firrotta:2022cku, Bedroya:2022twb, Firrotta:2023wem, DiVecchia:2023frv}).
Alternatively, one can  seek to understand the high-temperature thermodynamics of strings~\cite{Sundborg:1984uk, Tye:1985jv, Alvarez:1985fw, Bowick:1985az, Salomonson:1985eq, McClain:1986id, Sathiapalan:1986db, OBrien:1987kzw, Mitchell:1987hr, Mitchell:1987th, Axenides:1987vi, Atick:1988si, Brandenberger:1988aj, Deo:1988jj, Deo:1989bv, Bowick:1989us, Deo:1991mp, Lowe:1994nm, Lee:1997iz, Abel:1999rq, Barbon:2004dd, Mertens:2015ola}, which is closely  related to the interactions
of highly excited string states. This is a much studied subject, and implications for early universe cosmology can be very important~\cite{ Nayeri:2005ck, Brandenberger:2006vv, Brandenberger:2006xi, Frey:2005jk, Frey:2021jyo}.
Yet, many open problems remain. In this article we will address some of these
(touching upon both equilibrium and non-equilibrium aspects) primarily focusing on the Boltzmann
equation approach. We begin by providing a brief summary of our results; for convenience, we use units in which the string length is one throughout the manuscript.





\subsection*{Summary of Results}
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item  Using the standard formulation of kinetic theory and detailed balance we analyse the 
form of equilibrium number densities for strings. The standard result is 
Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions multiplied by the level degeneracies. 
For strings, there is the additional caveat that highly energetic strings (which are very long) can
occupy the entire volume, the  structure of the phase space changes.
This sets the background for obtaining the ``detailed balance" equations for highly excited strings. This is done in section \ref{sec:general-argument}.

%
\item Making use of results available in the literature~\cite{Amati:1999fv,Manes:2001cs,Chen:2005ra} and  carrying out generalisations, we analyse interactions and decay rates of highly excited strings so as to gather the inputs needed to
set up Boltzmann equations. The interactions/decays are length preserving and  consistent
with the random walk picture of highly excited strings. This is done is section
\ref{sec:decayrates}.
%
\item We set up Boltzmann equations (along the line of \cite{Lowe:1994nm,Lee:1997iz}, and ~\cite{Copeland:1998na} where a  similar study of a distribution of closed loops was carried out in the context of cosmic strings) in the case that open/closed strings
are in effectively non-compact directions.\footnote{A dimension will be considered effectively non-compact if
it is of large enough size so that typical strings of the ensemble perceive then to be non-compact. Having non-compact directions is important for 
cosmological applications.}
The random walk picture is used as a guideline.
Equilibrium solutions are obtained using 
detailed balance. An interesting feature is that detailed balance is organised length by length
of the strings. This is done is section \ref{sec:boltzmann}.
%
\item Non-equilibrium dynamics (for  closed strings  and  closed/open admixtures) is analysed by considering perturbations about the equilibrium configurations. Explicit analytic solutions are obtained, the dependence of the damping rates on length of
strings is discussed. There is very little study of  non-equilibrium dynamics of highly excited strings, our study opens up various avenues
for exploration. This is done in section \ref{sec:perturbations}.



    
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Review}

  Let us review some  aspects of string thermodynamics. Here, we will focus on basic features of the density of states (for free strings). In some sense, this is complementary
to the Boltzmann equation approach --- we give only a brief discussion so that the reader can connect to the results obtained in the main text.
Also, we will explain here the notion of ``effectively non-compact directions" in string thermodynamics. We refer the reader to
\cite{Mertens:2015ola} for a more detailed review 
and a comprehensive list of references.

It is a simple consequence of the exponential degeneracy of the density of states of a system of strings, $\Omega(E)\sim E^\gamma e^{\beta_H E}$
--- where $E$ is the state energy and $\beta_H\sim 1/\sqrt{\alpha'}$ is the inverse Hagedorn temperature ---
that something interesting occurs as the temperature $1/\beta$ of a system reaches the value $1/\beta_H$.
Indeed, in the formal regime $\beta < \beta_H$ (\textit{i.e}, at temperatures higher than the Hagedorn temperature),
the canonical partition function, $Z\sim \int_0^\infty{dE\, E^\gamma e^{-(\beta-\beta_H) E}}$, diverges exponentially.
Such Hagedorn behaviour was studied in the early days in the bootstrap model for hadrons, e.g.~\cite{Hagedorn:1965st, Hagedorn:1967tlw, Hagedorn:1967dia, Hagedorn:1971mc, Frautschi:1971ij, PhysRevD.5.3231, Cabibbo:1975ig}, and it was shown that for $\gamma<-1$ the microcanonical and canonical ensembles do not agree, due to large energy fluctuations of the latter. 

The issue in string theory is even more intricate.
As was shown in~\cite{Deo:1988jj}, one must be very careful in taking the thermodynamic limit where the energy $E\rightarrow \infty,$ the volume of the system $V\rightarrow \infty$, and $\rho=E/V=\text{constant}$, not only due to the Jeans instability (present in any gravitational system) but also due to the fact that even a single highly excited string can fill 
the entire volume of the space a large number of times.
In  fact, it is compactness that saves the high energy regime of string theory from inconsistencies like a negative specific heat. 
It was argued in~\cite{Brandenberger:1988aj} that \textit{any} background where string propagation can be 
described by a nine dimensional unitary superconformal CFT (supplemented with a time direction)  has single-string density of states $\hat{d}$ in the high energy regime of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:compact-dos}
    \hat{d}(\varepsilon)=\frac{e^{\beta_H \varepsilon}}{\varepsilon}\, ,
\end{equation}
for a individual string of energy $\varepsilon$, and corrections to this formula yield a positive specific heat, and thus a proper thermodynamic behaviour.\footnote{
This quantity is not to be confused with the full density of states of the system, $\Omega(E)$, which determines whether the microcanonical and canonical ensembles agree.} The case where some of the dimensions are (effectively) noncompact is more intricate. 
In this case, the density of states takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:noncompact-dos}
    \hat{d}(\varepsilon)=V\frac{e^{\beta_H \varepsilon}}{\varepsilon^{1+d/2}}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the number of effectively non-compact directions and $V$ is their volume in string units (the energies 
are also in string units). 
Using this naively in the high energy regime, one obtains a negative specific heat.\footnote{
As is well known, this density of states gives rise to a system composed of one very large string carrying most of the energy density, surrounded by a bath of very short strings.}

A consistent picture is obtained by requiring that for thermodynamical questions we always put strings
on compact spaces, but depending on the energy scales involved, directions can be effectively non-compact. The difference between \eqref{eq:compact-dos} and \eqref{eq:noncompact-dos} has a simple
explanation in the random walk picture of highly excited strings. A long string of length $l$ 
(which has energy $l$) is a random walk in $d$ dimensions which effectively occupies a volume
$l^{d/2}$. The regime in which the string perceives the space as compact corresponds to
  $l^{d/2} \gg V$. 
Furthermore, because it effectively occupies the entire volume of the space there is no translational zero-mode: the degrees of freedom
are those of internal excitations of the string.  On the other hand, for  $l^{d/2} < V$,
the space is perceived as non-compact. The density of states in \eqref{eq:noncompact-dos}
has a multiplicative relative factor of  $\frac{V}{ l^{d/2}}$ in comparison with \eqref{eq:compact-dos},
corresponding  to degrees of freedom associated with the translational zero mode
of the string \cite{Abel:1999rq}.\footnote{Also, Polchinski as cited by \cite{Lowe:1994nm}.} 

Similarly, the single open string density of states $d_o(\varepsilon)$ in the torus setup satisfies, in a configuration with $N$ parallel D$p$-branes separated by a distance $X\ll \sqrt{\varepsilon}$~\cite{Abel:1999rq}
\begin{equation}
    d_o(\varepsilon)\sim \begin{cases}
        N^2\frac{V_{\|}}{\varepsilon^{(d-p)/2}}e^{\beta_H \varepsilon}\, & R\gg \sqrt{\varepsilon}\, ,\\    
        & \\
        N^2\frac{V_{\|}}{V_{\perp}}e^{\beta_H \varepsilon}\, & R\ll \sqrt{\varepsilon}\, .
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of D-branes, $V_\|$ $(V_\perp)$ is the volume parallel (transverse) to the branes, and $d$ is the number of effectively noncompact dimensions (with $d-p$ orthogonal to the branes) with typical radius $R$. 

We thus conclude that the notions of density of states and effectively noncompact dimensions depend on the average length of the string. 
Thus, the thermodynamics will be described differently in the different energy regimes. In this paper we will describe how all of these densities of states appear as solutions of the Boltzmann equations, with the appropriate interaction rates for highly excited strings.
We will not, however, aim to describe the transition between regimes, since it is during these transitions that the canonical ensemble fails~\cite{Barbon:2004dd}.

\subsection*{Key Ingredients}

   Now, we describe the key ingredients of our analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Worldsheet 
    
 Interactions are crucial for writing Boltzmann equations. 
The primary approach to calculating scattering (or decay) amplitudes for high energy string states is string perturbation theory on the worldsheet. For example,~\cite{Amati:1999fv} computed the emission of massless states for highly excited strings, and, in a similar fashion, \cite{Manes:2001cs} calculated decay rates of long strings by emission of strings of arbitrary mass (generalized in~\cite{Chen:2005ra} to include supersymmetric strings and compactification effects). 
Further examples include~\cite{Manes:2003mw,Manes:2004nd} which worked out the cross section for low-energy tachyons scattering off a highly excited string. In this paper, we will review the worldsheet calculation of decay rates from \cite{Manes:2001cs} and clarify the work of \cite{Chen:2005ra} including KK and winding number.


The worldsheet has also been used to study the  single string density of states in the microcanonical ensemble from explicit state counting~\cite{Mitchell:1987th} or by studying the singularity structure of the free energy~\cite{Deo:1988jj,Deo:1989bv,Deo:1991mp}, agreeing in the conclusion of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:compact-dos} and~\eqref{eq:noncompact-dos}. As pointed out by those authors, there is a risk of inconsistency in this approach: the calculations are performed for a free string, while ergodicity (fundamental for the microcanonical approach) requires an interaction among the string constituents. In this paper, we give a short but general argument for why their results apply to the general case of interactions in string perturbation theory, as long as the modifications to the  string spectrum vanish in the limit of $g_s \to 0$ (\textit{i.e} as long as string perturbation theory holds). 

    \item Random walks

    It has long been argued that highly excited strings form random walks (see e.g.~\cite{Mitchell:1987th}).
    A simple way to see this is through entropic arguments: one can show that the leading order contributions to the entropy of a highly excited state and a random walk coincide.
The worldsheet scattering amplitudes of~\cite{Manes:2003mw,Manes:2004nd} mentioned above yield a form factor consistent with a random walk structure for long strings.
    
    Similar conclusions to those in the worldsheet approach can be reached using random walk arguments (see e.g.~\cite{Barbon:2004dd}) to compute the single-string density of states.
    In this paper, we explain the random walk interpretation of the decay rates of long, fundamental strings.
    This random walk interpretation serves as a guide for the form of higer-point functions and hybrid interactions in situations where a  worldsheet derivation is not available. We check the validity of these by showing that they satisfy detailed balance for the known equilibrium distribution. 

    \item The Boltzmann equation 


   Armed with the form of the interaction rates, we will write down Boltzmann equations following the
approach of~\cite{Lowe:1994nm,Lee:1997iz} and ~\cite{Copeland:1998na} in the context of cosmic strings.
Note that this approach yields Eq.~\eqref{eq:compact-dos} for the density of states at $d=0$, hence  confirming validity of the result in the presence of interactions.
We will obtain Boltzmann equations (for both open and closed strings)  when some of the directions are effectively non-compact (corresponding to the system at lower energies).
These equations allow us to probe out-of equilibrium phenomena, of which very little has been explored in the case of strings.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Organisation of the Paper}


This paper is organized as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:general-argument}, we settle our notation with a short introduction to the generalization of standard kinetic theory to string theory.
Through a textbook argument, we introduce the notion of detailed balance, which illustrates (in a background independent way) why the computations for equilibrium configurations performed for free strings agree with those computed in string perturbation theory.
Unsurprisingly, these equilibrium configurations are given by Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distributions, corrected by an exponential density of states.

In Section~\ref{sec:decayrates}, we summarize the computation of semi-inclusive averaged interaction rates to second order in string perturbation theory, using the important results of~\cite{Manes:2001cs}.
We find that the behaviour of the typical decay rate is such that strings behave non-relativistically and that winding modes are efficiently distributed proportionally to the mass of the strings.
This justifies using the length (equivalently, mass) of the string to describe the thermodynamics at sufficiently high level.
Furthermore, we provide a random walk interpretation of the interaction rates, which allows us to conjecture the form of higher-order interaction rates.
To the best of our knowledge, many of these interaction rates have not appeared elsewhere in the literature.
These conjectures satisfy the non-trivial test of consistency with detailed balance for the equilibrium distribution found for lower-order interactions in string perturbation theory.

Section~\ref{sec:boltzmann} contains the main result of the paper. Using the results above, we pose the Boltzmann equations describing three different regimes, and find equilibrium distributions.
First, we consider the thermodynamics of closed strings in $d$ effectively noncompact spatial dimensions, finding\footnote{Subscripts $c,o$ respectively correspond to closed and open strings in our notation.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:onlyclosed}
     n_c(l) = V \frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{1+d/2}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $n_c(l)dl$ is the number of strings with lengths\footnote{Throughout the text, we exchange the length of the strings by their masses, as they are the same in string units.} between $l$ and $l+dl$, and discuss why this is in agreement with previous results upon identification of $1/L=\beta-\beta_H>0$.
The constants $\kappa_{a,b} \sim g_s^2$ are $d-$dependent numbers which do not affect our discussion.

Later, we introduce D-branes, and force the open and closed strings to lie within a $d$-dimensional, effectively noncompact, space-filling brane or, equivalently, densely spaced D$p$-branes ($p<d$).
We find that the equilibrium distributions of strings are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:confined}
     n_o(l)=\frac{2a \kappa_b N^2V_\parallel}{b \kappa_aV_\perp}e^{-l/L}\, , \qquad 
     n_c(l) = V \frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{1+d/2}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of parallel, effectively overlapping D$d$-branes in the $d$ directions.
These span a worldvolume $V_\parallel$, and the transverse volume is denoted $V_\perp$, which together yield a total volume $V=V_\parallel \cdot V_\perp$, and $a$ and $b$ are $\mathcal{O}(g_s)$ and $d-$dependent computable quantities.

Lastly, we let the strings probe the dimensions transverse to the brane, thus describing the thermodynamics of a D$p$-brane in a $d+1$-dimensional spacetime.
We find that the equilibrium distributions are now given by
\begin{equation}
     n_o(l)=\frac{2a \kappa_bN^2V_\parallel}{b \kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{(d-p)/2}} \, , \qquad 
     n_c(l) = V \frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{1+d/2}} \, .
\end{equation}

In Section~\ref{sec:perturbations} we study the behaviour of these equilibrium distributions under fluctuations.
For the $d=0$ case in absence of branes, we find an analytic solution for the behaviour of linear fluctuations, which decay with a length-dependent rate $\Gamma(l)=\kappa (l^2/2+l L)/V$.
With knowledge of the explicit solution, we study the origin of this qualitative behaviour of $\Gamma (l)$ and argue for its expression in more complicated setups.
We find length-dependent equilibration rates that are sensitive to the number of non-compact directions, the total energy of the gas and the string coupling.

Lastly, we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} with a summary and future directions.
This approach to string thermodynamics is particularly powerful because it can describe the evolution of the thermal system when it falls out of equilibrium, providing us with computational tools to study a putative Hagedorn phase in the early Universe,
which we leave for a future paper~\cite{Frey:2024in}.




\section{Stringy kinetic theory}\label{sec:general-argument}

In this section we summarize the setup for a stringy version of kinetic theory (see e.g.~\cite{Tong:notes} for an introduction to standard kinetic theory) and give an argument for why the density of states gives the string number density even in presence of interactions. These ideas will lead us to the detailed balance equations in the later sections.


Consider a probability density for a single string in a generalized phase space, $f(r,k,N,\sigma)$, which apart from the usual position and momentum variables $r,k$ in the non-compact directions,\footnote{Note there is no position dependence along the compact directions, since the string is occupying the whole space.} includes the oscillator level $N$, and other discrete variables $\sigma$ which in toroidal compactifications include winding and KK modes.
For ease of notation, in this section we will write $f(E_l,l)$, where in the example of closed strings in a toroidal background we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy}
    E_l^2=k^2+\frac{2}{\alpha'}(N_L+N_R-2)+\sum_{i=1}^{d_c}\lr{{\lr{\frac{n_i}{R_i}}^2+\lr{\frac{\omega_iR_i}{\alpha'}}^2}}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the spatial momentum in the (effectively) noncompact directions, $N_L$ and $N_R$ are left and right moving oscillator levels, respectively, and ${n_i,\omega_i}$ denote the KK and winding modes along the $i^{th}$ direction, of radius $R_i$.
Throughout the text, we will refer to the length of the string as its proper length, defined by $M=\mu l$, where $\mu$ is the tension of the string and $M$ its mass, obtained from~\eqref{eq:energy} through $E^2=k^2+M^2$. 
In the rest of the text, we will use the chemistry notation $l\rightleftharpoons x+y$ to indicate the decay of a string of length $l$ to a pair of strings of lengths $x$ and $y$, or the absorption of a string of length $x$ by a string of length $y$ to yield a string of length $l$. 
The amplitude of any such process will be given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: }
    |{\langle \Phi_{x} | V_y(k) | \Phi_{l}}\rangle |^2\equiv \mathcal{A} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we have considered particular states (\textit{i.e.} with fixed $r,k,N,\sigma$), and have made use of the state-operator correspondence to write the amplitude in this way, because it is this form that we will use in Sec.~\ref{sec:decayrates} to compute the interactions.

This reaction will contribute the following term in the Boltzmann equation for $f(E_l,l)$:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial f(E_l,l)}{\partial t} \supset \sum_{\sigma_x \sigma_y}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^p}{d^pk_x \, d^p k_y\, \mathcal{A} \lr{ f_xf_y\lr{1\pm f_l}-f_l\lr{1\pm f_x}\lr{1\pm f_y}}}\delta(...)} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta(...)$ takes into account several conservation equations, like energy or, in the case of only closed strings, winding number.
The equilibrium configuration $\partial f_{eq}/\partial t=0$ can be found by the requirement of \textit{detailed balance}, i.e that the terms of all the individual reactions that contribute to the Boltzmann equation cancel out separately.
It is easy to see that this yields a Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distribution for the individual strings:
\begin{equation}
    f_{eq}(r,k,N,\sigma)=\frac{1}{e^{\beta E}\mp 1}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is not fixed yet.
This result is not useful for several reasons. 
First of all, it is simply the canonical ensemble statement that all microstates with the same energy have the same probability.
It is, however, very unlikely that in a thermodynamic setup we know about the particular state of a system, or (as lower dimensional observers) its windings.
The best we can aim at is to know the mean length (equivalently, mass) of the individual strings. 
Nicely, for fixed $k$, all such strings have the same energy, and we can thus write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq-dist}
    f_{eq}(r,k,l)=\frac{\mathcal{N}(l)}{e^{\beta E}\mp 1}\, .
\end{equation}

This is how the density of states at a given mass $\mathcal{N}(l)$ shows up in our considerations.
In what follows, we will set up Boltzmann equations for the \textit{typical} strings, for which we will argue that the energy is dominated by the level (as opposed to the combination of level plus winding and KK modes), and thus can be described by a net number\footnote{Note that we depart here from the usual statistical mechanics notions, where the density of particles is used. We use the net number for consistency with previous work~\cite{Lowe:1994nm,Lee:1997iz} and because for $d=0$, where the strings occupy the whole volume, the definition of density becomes subtle.} phase space density $n(l)dl$.
We will use the high energy limit of Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq-dist} (analogously, Eq.~\eqref{eq:compact-dos} or~\eqref{eq:noncompact-dos}, as appropriate) as a consistency check for our results.
\\

Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq-dist} is a simple consequence of ordinary statistical mechanics, reproducing the Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distribution to the quantity of interest in string thermodynamics, $n(l)$. 
It is worth noting that this expression applies for strings at any energy, and no divergences (except for the well known Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon for massless strings) appear in the equation.
This is different than the expression one would obtain from Eq.~\eqref{eq:compact-dos} because that one only applies when the energy is dominated by the mass (equivalently, length) of the string.
In the appropriate high energy regime, of course, the results are equivalent.\footnote{The results differ in $d-$dependent constants because $f(r,k,l)$ and $n(l)$ are not exactly the same quantity, and differ by $e.g.$ integration over all external momenta at given mass.}

More interestingly, this equilibrium distribution together with the exponential form $e^{\beta_H l}$ of the density of states predicts a Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distribution for massless fields at an effective temperature $1/\beta<1/\beta_H$. 
We can point out two implications of this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As long as our description is valid, the temperature of the massless fields never reaches the Hagedorn temperature.
    This is because once the strings reach energies of order one, oscillator modes govern the thermodynamics. 
    \item Due to the $N^2$ degeneracy and the fact that $n_o(l)\sim ln_c(l)$, open strings dominate the ensemble. 
    These observations suggest interesting features of a reheating period involving the Hagedorn phase.
\end{itemize}


The argument exposed in this section is purely kinematic. 
It is easy to see that, upon summing over all final configurations and averaging over all possible initial conditions, the statement of detailed balance applies in the same way for higher point functions, with more terms.
We have thus shown that the distribution in Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq-dist} holds at all orders in string perturbation theory. 
Note also that the argument is background independent, although of course the difficulty now lies in computing $\mathcal{N}(l)$, which is known for toroidal compactifications but not necessarily in more complicated backgrounds.\footnote{For technical reasons, we will  restrict our analysis to toroidal backgrounds for various explicit computations in the paper.
It would be interesting to generalize this approach to more realistic compactifications.} 

  Before closing this section, we note that the ideas in this section will help us to
set up the detailed balance conditions that we will use to obtain equilibrium solutions
to the Boltzmann equation (in section \ref{sec:boltzmann}).

     

\section{General results in decay rates}\label{sec:decayrates}

In the previous section, we have argued how the requirement of detailed balance in the Boltzmann equations gives rise to the well known Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distributions. 
There is a natural question: under what conditions can the strings reach equilibrium? 
In ordinary thermodynamics, one simply waits long enough until equilibrium is reached, provided there is some interaction that allows the system to move through phase space.
In situations with gravity, this is no longer true, and the dynamics of spacetime do not allow us to ``wait long enough", unless the interaction rates are much faster than the gravitational effects on the system.
Examples include decoupling of species due to the expansion of the Universe or overdensities due to gravitational collapse.
Knowledge of interaction and equilibration rates is thus essential to assess whether equilibrium thermodynamics appropriately describes a gravitating system.
\\

A worldsheet computation of an amplitude involving highly excited strings is in general complicated, due to the degeneracy and the complicated spin structure of the state (although progress has been made in this direction~\cite{Hindmarsh:2010if, Skliros:2011si, Skliros:2013pka}).
However, a very simple observation allows for the computations that are relevant for us: in a thermal ensemble, the interaction rate is dominated by the \textit{typical} string.
Phrased in a different way, since all oscillator states have the same probability, in a thermodynamic system we cannot be sure of which is the particular initial state of an interaction, and thus we must average over all such initial states.
This observation was first used in~\cite{Amati:1999fv} to compute the emission of massless strings from very massive ones.

In this section we study interaction rates of the typical string from a worldsheet point of view, closely following~\cite{Manes:2001cs}.
We also consider compactification effects~\cite{Chen:2005ra}, and include further insights on absorption rates.
The main point is that the form of the decay rates at sufficiently high level predicts a distribution of strings that is completely determined by their length, $n(l)$.
Furthermore, we give a random-walk interpretation for the decay rates. 
This allows us to conjecture the form of the hybrid interactions, mixing open and closed strings, and having this we will be able to pose a system of Boltzmann equations for $n(l)$.



\subsection{Averaged 3-point amplitude}

The idea is as follows. 
We want to study the process of decay of a highly excited string at fixed level $N$, to a string in a specific state determined by a vertex operator $V_1(k)$, and another massive string at fixed level $N_2<N$.
In the case of a compactification, we also fix winding and KK momentum of the strings.
Because we are considering a thermal ensemble, we average over all possible initial configurations at this level.
Summing over all possible final states at fixed level $N_2$, the amplitude for the process is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq: smatrix}
    \frac{F(N,N_2)}{\mathcal{G}(N)}\equiv \frac{1}{\mathcal{G}(N)}\sum_{\Phi_N} \sum_{\Phi_{N_2}}|{\langle \Phi_{N_2} | V_1(k) | \Phi_{N}}\rangle |^2 \, , 
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is the oscillator degeneracy of the level $N$ (not to be confused with the number of states at a given mass $\mathcal{N}(l)dl$), and the different $|\Phi_N\rangle$ account for the different states at a level $N$. 
Through the insertion of projectors at levels $N$ and $N_2$, this expression can be written as a trace over oscillator modes\footnote{Importantly, we are not summing over windings/KK modes, and because of this reason the calculation is the same in the compact and noncompact case.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq: trace}
    F(N,N_2) = \oint_C \frac{d\, z}{z}z^{-N} \oint_{C_2} \frac{d\, z_2}{z_2}z_2^{-N_2} \text{Tr} \left[z^{\hat{N}}V_1^\dag (k,1) z_2^{\hat N}V_1(k,1)\right] \, ,
\end{equation}
where the projectors are contour integrals around zero, and $\hat{N}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\alpha_{-n}\cdot \alpha_n}$ is the number operator. 
In passing, we note that an appropriate redefinition renders this formula and the upcoming discussion valid for absorption of strings (in which case $N_2>N$). 
The S-matrix element in Eq.~\eqref{eq: smatrix} is the same upon exchange $V_1 \rightarrow V_1^\dag$. 
This implies, using the cyclic property of the trace in Eq.~\eqref{eq: trace}, that for processes involving an initial state at level $N$ and a final state at level $N_2$, 
\begin{equation}
    F_{em}(N,N_2)=F_{abs}(N_2,N)\, ,
\end{equation}
which illustrates the crossing symmetry of the amplitude.
\\

Using coherent state techniques \cite{Green:1987sp}, it can be argued that, in $D$ spacetime dimensions,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}
    F(N,N_{2})=\oint \frac{d \omega}{\omega}\omega^{-N}& f(\omega)^{2-D} \mathcal{I}_{N-N_2}(\omega) \,, \\ 
    \mathcal{I}_n \equiv \oint \frac{dv}{v} \, v^n\langle &V'^\dag(k,1) V'(k,v) \rangle  \, ,
\end{split}
\end{gather}
where $f(\omega)$ is related to the partition function (see~\cite{Manes:2001cs}) and the prime on the vertex operator indicates a substraction of a zero-mode that is not relevant for our discussion. 
The key observation of~\cite{Manes:2001cs} is that for known level $N_1$ of the product string of known state, the functions $\mathcal{I}_n (\omega)$ satisfy recursion relations which depend only on $N_1$. 
This leads to the final result 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:manes-amplitude}
\begin{split}
    F(N,N_2)=\sum_{p=1}^A \frac{\partial \mathfrak{n}}{\partial p}\mathcal{G}\left[\mathfrak{n}\right] & +F_{NU}(N,N_2) \, , \\
    \mathfrak{n}\equiv N-(N-N_2)p+& (N_1-1)(p^2-p)\, , \\
    F_{NU}(N,N_2)\equiv \oint \frac{d \omega}{\omega}\omega^{-N}f(\omega)^{2-D} & \mathcal{I}_\nu (\omega) \omega^{\nu A +(N_1-1)(A^2+A)} \, ,
\end{split}
\end{gather}
where $\nu \equiv (N-N_2) \, \text{mod} \, 2(N_1-1)$, and $A=1$ for normalized states and otherwise is the leading coefficient of the OPE of the vertex operators.
As checked in~\cite{Manes:2001cs}, except for $N_1=1$, it is the universal contribution that dominates\footnote{Technically, the non-universal part can become important for $M_1\geq 2M_2$ for soft decays $M\simeq M_1+M_2$. For our purposes, if this were the case, we could trade $M_1$ by $M_2$ (\textit{i.e}: assume we know the state of $N_2$ instead of $N_1$) and carry the calculations through.} due to the degeneracy of the levels.
We will only consider this part in what follows, except for massless strings, where an exact solution was computed in~\cite{Amati:1999fv}.

\subsection{Interaction rates}

The amplitude shows crossing symmetry, but the notion of interaction rate does not.
In this subsection we will be careful in understanding what is the dominant product of the decay of a typical string and of the inverse process, the fusion of two typical strings.
This will be the dominant type of string in a thermal ensemble.
We will see that typical decay products are strings with small noncompact momentum in the center of mass frame, and that KK and winding modes are distributed proportionally to the length of the string, in such a way that the energy is efficiently converted into oscillator modes.
In turn, this implies that the mass of the string is essentially given by the oscillator level, up to small corrections, and thus that the energy of highly excited strings is determined by the level. 

\subsubsection*{Emission}

Knowing the amplitude, we can write down the total averaged semi-inclusive decay rate for the process $N\rightarrow V_1+N_2$, where $N$ ($N_2$) is a typical string at level $N$ ($N_2$), and the specific state of $V_1$, at level $N_1$, is known.
Taking into account relativistic normalization of the states and integrating over final external momenta after considering momentum and energy conservation, this is given by
\begin{gather}\label{eq:particular-rate}
\begin{split}
    \Gamma_o\lr{N \rightarrow V_1+N_2}=& A_{d+1} \frac{g_s}{M^2}\frac{F(N,N_2)}{\mathcal{G}(N)}k^{d-2} \, , \\
    \Gamma_{c}\lr{N \rightarrow V_1+N_2}=A_{d+1} \frac{g_s^2}{M^2} &\frac{F(N_L,N_{2,L})}{\mathcal{G}(N_L)}\frac{F(N_R,N_{2,R})}{\mathcal{G}(N_R)}k^{d-2} \, ,
\end{split}
\end{gather}
where $M$ ($M_i$) is the mass of the initial (outgoing) string, $k$ is the outgoing string
momentum,\footnote{Importantly, this quantity is fixed by conservation of energy. We use it as a book-keeping device to study the deviation from length conservation.} we have split the closed string amplitude into left and right movers, and 
\begin{equation}
    A_{d+1}=\frac{2^{-(d+1)}\pi^{1-d/2}}{\Gamma\lr{\frac{d}{2}}}\, .
\end{equation}

These formulae are however not the quantities we are interested in, since they assume knowledge of the particular state of one of the products.
However, because we are considering only the state-independent part of the amplitude (recall Eq.~\eqref{eq:manes-amplitude}), we can include all the product strings at level $N_1$ simply multiplying by the degeneracy.
If, on top of this, both of the product strings are sufficiently long, the dominant contribution to Eq.~\eqref{eq:manes-amplitude} is given by the first term.
Within these approximations (which we use for an analytic understanding but can be easily lifted up if one desires to obtain further accuracy, or is interested in smaller excitation numbers), we get an expression for the rate of particles at levels $N_1,N_2$ from a typical string at level $N$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate-N}
\begin{split}
    \Gamma_o\lr{N \rightarrow N_1+N_2}\simeq A_{d+1}\frac{g_s}{M^2}\Tilde{N}\Tilde{\mathcal{G}}k^{d-2} \, , \\
    \Gamma_{c}\lr{N \rightarrow N_1+N_2}\simeq A_{d+1} \frac{g_s^2}{M^2}\Tilde{N}_L\Tilde{\mathcal{G}}_L\Tilde{N}_R\Tilde{\mathcal{G}}_Rk^{d-2} \, , \\
    \Tilde{N}\equiv (N+1-N_1-N_2)\, , \qquad \Tilde{\mathcal{G}}\equiv  \frac{\mathcal{G}(N_1)\mathcal{G}(N_2)}{\mathcal{G}(N)}\, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In principle, this is all we need to formulate Boltzmann equations for probability densities $f(k,N,\sigma)$.
However, further study of these expressions allow us to get an idea of what the typical decay strings look like in the ensemble and, as we will see, will allow us to extract simple, analytic expressions describing the decay of the typical string which only depend on its length and the number of noncompact dimensions (even in the presence of winding! See Appendix~\ref{sec:winding-modes}).

In the main text, we quickly review the arguments of~\cite{Manes:2001cs} to find that in noncompact dimensions the typical decay approximately conserves length, from which we infer that the typical string is nonrelativistic in a frame in which the gas has zero net momentum. 
In Appendix~\ref{sec:winding-modes}, we carefully consider the compact case with windings and KK modes, inspired by~\cite{Chen:2005ra}, and show that one can safely ignore the effects of the compact directions at sufficiently large oscillator number.
In passing, we comment on an important mass dependence that was missed in~\cite{Chen:2005ra} and that is the key for a random walk interpretation.
The fact that in Sec.~\ref{sec:boltzmann} it is this corrected contribution that gives the right equilibrium solution, agreeing with Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq-dist} at high energies, supports the claim that our result is correct.
\\

The interplay between the degeneracies and $k$ (which is not a free parameter, but is instead related to the masses by conservation of energy) is what gives the features of the typical interactions.
As argued in~\cite{Manes:2001cs}, in absence of winding, the oscillator degeneracies give rise to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the \textit{mass defect} $t\equiv M-M_1-M_2$ (\textit{i.e:} the amount of kinetic energy created in the process), which peaks around the mass of the fundamental string. 
This implies that conservation of length is a good approximation for these interactions.
The way to see this is as follows. 
First, recall the Hardy-Ramanujan expression for the degeneracy of the oscillators at sufficiently large ($N\gtrsim 5$) level,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{G}(N)\sim (2\pi T_H)^{-(D+1)/2}N^{-(D+1)/4}e^{\sqrt{N/\alpha '}/ T_H}\, .
\end{equation}
Introducing this in $\Tilde{\mathcal{G}}$, it follows from the exponential dependence that $t\sim \mathcal{O}(T_H)\ll \sqrt{N/\alpha '}\simeq M$ and thus that the typical strings are very nonrelativistic, with (as can be easily shown from conservation of energy and momentum) 
\begin{equation}
    t\sim \frac{k^2}{2}\frac{M}{M_1 M_2}\, .
\end{equation}
This allows us to write the expression for $\Gamma$ in terms of $t$ (which in turn determines $N_2$), $N$, and $N_1$.
\begin{gather}\label{eq:notfull-rate}
\begin{split}
    \Gamma_o\lr{N \rightarrow N_1+N_2}\simeq & \frac{g_s}{M_1 M_2}\, t^{d/2-1}e^{-t/T_H} \, , \\
    \Gamma_{c}\lr{N \rightarrow N_1+N_2}\simeq g_s^2 & \lr{\frac{M}{M_1M_2}}^{d/2+1}t^{d/2-1}e^{-2t/T_H} \, .
\end{split}
\end{gather}
This implies that the equipartition principle is satisfied in the noncompact directions,
\begin{equation}
    \langle t\rangle=\frac{d}{2}T_H\, ,
\end{equation}
as can be seen from computing the expectation value of $t$ in this distribution.
\\

We have thus found the probability of decay of a string at level $N$ to a pair of strings at levels $N_1$ and $N_2$.
Still following~\cite{Manes:2001cs}, let us now ask the following questions: what is the total production rate of strings at level $N_1$ from strings at level $N$?
And what is the most likely $N_2$ arising from such a decay?
The answer is obtained by summing Eqs.~\eqref{eq:notfull-rate} over all possible $N_2$ through $dN_2\sim M_2dt$.
The sum is well approximated by an integral, and (up to a numerical constant) this evaluates $t$ at the saddle $t\sim \mathcal{O}(T_H)\ll \text{min}\lbrace M,M_1,M_2\rbrace$, implying $M_2\simeq M-M_1$.
Because departure from this value of $t$ is exponentially supressed, we conclude that decays tend to preserve length.

Lastly, we have computed the rate in terms of the level of the product. 
However, since we will be characterising the strings in terms of their length,\footnote{One can think of the quantites $\Gamma_{o,c}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:notfull-rate} as shorthand for $\Gamma/\Delta N_1 \Delta N_2$. We have then summed to get $\Gamma/\Delta N_1=\sum_{N_2}(\Gamma/\Delta N_1 \Delta N_2)\Delta N_2\simeq \int(\Gamma/\Delta N_1 \Delta N_2) M_2 \, dt$, and then expressed $\Gamma/\Delta N_1=(1/M_1)(d\Gamma/dM_1)=(1/M_1)(d\Gamma/dl')$, where the last equality follows in string units.}
we need to convert $dN_1=M_1dM_1$ to find the total number of strings produced with masses between $M_1$ and $M_1+dM_1$:
\begin{gather}\label{eq:decay-rates}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d \Gamma_o}{d l'}\sim &  \, g_s \, , \\ 
    \frac{d\Gamma_{c}}{dl'} \sim  \, & g_s^2 l \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{d/2} \, .
\end{split}
\end{gather}
where we have defined $l'\equiv M_1/M_s^2$ and $l\equiv M/M_s^2$, work in string units $M_s=1$, and the proportionality constants are independent of $l$ or $l'$.

\subsubsection*{Random walk interpretation}
The results in Eq.~\eqref{eq:decay-rates}, first derived in \cite{Manes:2001cs}, have an appealing semiclassical explanation.
Let us carefully discuss it in this section, since we will later use the intuition developed in the semiclassical picture to argue for the shape of complicated interaction rates.
Importantly, we will discuss the \textit{closed} random walk interpretation of the decay rate of closed strings, which is essential for detailed balance and thus to obtain a correct equilibrium distribution.

In the open string case, Eq.~\eqref{eq:decay-rates} reproduces the usual result that the typical string in a space-filling brane radiates all masses with equal probabilities.
This has the interpretation that the typical string lying along the D-brane can break equally well through any point.
\\

Before discussing the decay rate of a closed string, let us discuss some relevant notions regarding open random walks.
Two points separated by internal distance $l$ of an open random walk are separated by $l^{d/2}$ in a $d$-dimensional space, and the random walk thus fills a volume $l^{d/2}$ in $d$ effectively
noncompact dimensions (ie, dimensions larger than $l^{1/2}$ in string units). 
Therefore, the probability $P(l)$ that an open random walk of length 
$l$ closes is $P(l)\propto l^{-d/2}$ in $d$ noncompact spatial dimensions
(or $1/V$ if all dimensions are compact), which is the geometric probability that
the second end point is at the same position as the first end point within 
the volume filled by the string.

So what is the probability that a \textit{closed} random walk of length $l$ self-intersects?
Fixing a point of the random walk, we can ask what is the probability of a point at a distance $l'$ to touch this point.
But this is the same question as asking what is the probability that a point at a distance $l-l'$ touches this point.
The decay rate should thus
proportional to the probability that strings of length 
$l'$ and $l-l'$ both close, given that the parent string also closes (which we will denote by $P(l'\& (l-l')|l)$).
We have $P(l'\& (l-l'))/P(l)\sim P(l')P(l-l')/P(l)$ since the
two smaller loops are approximately independent for long strings. 
But this is precisely given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prob-closed}
    \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{d/2}\, ,
\end{equation}
(c.f: Eq.~\eqref{eq:decay-rates}), and the pre-factor $l$ in the decay rate simply shows that the point we have chosen can be any point along the string.
This shows that decay of a semiclassical string occurs upon self-intersection, and that such highly excited strings form closed random walks.
In addition, let us comment on the small string limit. 
It is clear that for $l'/l\ll 1$, the probability of self-intersection of a closed random walk reproduces that of an open random walk. 
This is to be interpreted as the small piece of string not being able to tell whether it belongs to an open or a closed string.
Importantly, this is the behaviour suggested by~\cite{Lowe:1994nm,Lee:1997iz} to generalize the Boltzmann equation approach to $d\neq 0$.
The reason why did this not work is because the closed strings are closed random walks, and the probability of decay in $d$-noncompact directions is Eq.~\eqref{eq:prob-closed} as opposed to $1/l^{d/2}$.
A similar form as Eq.~\eqref{eq:decay-rates} for the interaction rate was argued in~\cite{Copeland:1998na} assuming that the strings form random walks, and imposing detailed balance.
The calculation of~\cite{Manes:2001cs} thus gives a microscopic explanation for their assumptions, even though~\cite{Copeland:1998na} consider field theory strings.
In a similar spirit, it would be interesting to find a worldsheet computation for the interaction rates we pose in Section~\ref{sec:rws} from random walk arguments.
Consistency with detailed balance of these more complicated interaction rates support this picture.
\\


To further illustrate the random walk interpretation of the interaction rates, let us now discuss open strings on D$p$-branes.
Suppose that, instead of moving in $d$ dimensions as in the derivation of Eq.~\eqref{eq:decay-rates}, the open string end points 
are confined in the worldvolume of a D$p$-brane.
Then the phase space factor in 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:particular-rate} is modified to $k^p$.
Tracing appropriately the factors, we find equipartition of kinetic energy in the worldvolume and a decay rate given by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \Gamma_o}{dl'}\sim g_s \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{(d-p)/2}\, ,
\end{equation}
for one open string splitting into two open strings.
This relation has the random walk interpretation that the open string in the ($d-p$) directions transverse to the brane is a closed random walk (since both endpoints must touch the brane).

We will use the random walk interpretation of long string amplitudes 
extensively later in this section.

\subsubsection*{Absorption}

The simple argument we used when studying the derivation of~\cite{Manes:2001cs} yields the following interaction rates for absorption,
\begin{gather}\label{eq:absorption}
\begin{split}
    \Gamma_{o}\lr{N_1+N_2 \rightarrow N}=\frac{2\pi g_s}{8E_1 E_2 E_{M} V}\frac{F(N_1,N)}{\mathcal{G}(N_1)}\delta (E_1+E_2-M) \, , \\
    \Gamma_{c}\lr{N_1 +N_2\rightarrow N}=\frac{2\pi g_s^2}{8E_1 E_2 E_{M}V}\frac{F(N_1,N)^2}{\mathcal{G}(N_1)^2}\delta (E_1+E_2-M) \, .
\end{split}
\end{gather}
It is here where the absorption rate becomes different, since averaging over initial states of mass $M_2$ is trivial, and the phase space integration is different.
In particular, note that there are no phase space terms of the form $k^{d-2}$ because there is only one integral that goes away due to momentum conservation. Thus, terms depending on both the levels and the dimensionality will not appear in this case, and they should not, since we understood them before as random-walk probabilities for self-interaction.
\\

Since $F(N_1,N)\simeq (N+1-N_1-N_2)\mathcal{G}(N_1)\simeq 2\, M_1\, M_2\, \mathcal{G}(N_1)$, we find: 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:absorption-rates}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d \Gamma_o}{dl'} \sim & \, \frac{g_s}{V} \, , \\
    \, \frac{d \Gamma_{c}}{dl'} \sim & \,  g_s^2 \frac{l\hat{l}}{V} \, , 
\end{split}
\end{gather}
for a process with incoming strings of fixed lengths $l$ and $\hat{l}$, yielding a string of length $l'$.
Based on our findings in the previous section, namely that the typical decay renders highly excited, nonrelativistic strings, we are entitled to assume that the interactions preserve length, so $\hat{l}=l'-l$.

Again, the results can be interpreted semiclasically: absorption of an open string by an open string only occurs through the endpoints, so the rate should not depend on the lengths of the strings that interact. 
For closed strings, however, the interaction can happen anywhere along the string, so the rate is proportional to the product of the lengths. 

\subsection{Random walk arguments for other interactions}\label{sec:rws}

In the remainder of this section we use random walk arguments to conjecture the form of other interactions with strings at fixed levels but averaged or summed over states in those levels. Given the implicit interest of string physics at
high excitation, a microscopic derivation of these conjectures, as we have for 
three-point interactions above, would be valuable.

For us, these interaction rates will
play a role in formulating the Boltzmann equations for a distribution of open and closed strings, which at high level is determined by their length.
The fact that these interaction rates agree with detailed balance for the equilibrium solution of Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq-dist} is a nontrivial check.
Throughout the rest of the section, we write $d \Gamma/dl$ for all the interactions, whose particular nature should be understood by context.


\subsubsection*{High brane density or space-filling branes}

Let us begin by conjecturing the following form of the leading order hybrid interactions in the case of high D$p-$brane density, where we assume a stack of $N$ effectively overlapping parallel D$p-$branes, uniformly distributed in a transverse volume $V_{\perp}$.
Here, effectively overlapping means that the typical string is much longer than the D$p-$brane separation, and indeed the random walk argument we will use assumes that the open string is an open random walk in $d-$dimensions. 
We assume that the dimensions along the branes with volume $V_\|$ are 
effectively noncompact, and we include only effectively noncompact dimensions 
in $V_\perp$, following the discussion of Appendix \ref{sec:winding-modes}.
An example of this case is a space-filling brane ($d=p$) with only compact
dimensions transverse; then $V_\perp\equiv 1$.

For an open string closing up to yield a process open$\rightarrow$closed,
\begin{equation}
    \left.\frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\right|_{\text{ends fixed}}
\sim\frac{g_s}{l^{p/2}} \, ,
\end{equation}
if we assume that both end points are attached to the same brane. The
length-dependent factor comes from the probability for the string to close
in the dimensions along the brane. However, if we average over all incoming
strings, most of the strings will have ends attached to different branes.
For a given string attached at one end to a particular brane, the other end
can access a fraction $l^{(d-p)/2}/V_\perp$ of the $N$ branes, so the requirement
that both ends of the string are on the same brane reduces the amplitude
by a corresponding factor:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim \frac{V_{\perp}}{N}\frac{g_s}{l^{d/2}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the length of the product closed string.
In the case of space-filling branes, the entire $l^{-d/2}$ factor is the
probability of the random walk closing while all $N$ branes are accessible.
\\

Similarly, the chopping of a closed string by a D-brane to give closed$\rightarrow$open should be proportional to the length of the string since it can occur at any point, and to the density of D$p-$branes:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim \frac{N}{V_{\perp}}lg_s \, .
\end{equation} 
\\

Consider now the higher order absorption process (closed, open)$\rightarrow$open with lengths $(l',l-l')\rightarrow l$ within a space-filling brane.
This interaction can happen anywhere along both strings, so the dependence should be again proportional to the product of lengths:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim g_s^2 l' (l-l') \, .
\end{equation}
\\

The inverse emission process, however, has a probability factor $1/l'^{d/2}$ due to the requirement that a segment of length $l'$ of the string closes up.
If the initial string has length $l$, such closing up can occur along any of the $l-l'$ points.
This implies an overall probability of
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim g_s^2\frac{l-l'}{l'^{d/2}} \, .
\end{equation}

These decay rates are almost all we need to describe strings with effectively space-filling branes. To work consistenly at order $g_s^2$
in string perturbation theory, we must also include additional 4-point interactions describing (open,open)$\rightarrow$(open,open) processes.
These are described in Appendix~\ref{sec:22openstrings}.

Note that setting $p=0$ describes the case of compact dimensions along the
branes with branes densely distributed through effectively noncompact transverse
dimensions.

\subsubsection*{Isolated stack of branes}

The random walk approach becomes particularly useful if the stack of branes is isolated, and we let the strings extend outside the $(p+1)$-dimensional worldvolume.
The closed string interactions are not modified, and leading order hybrid interactions are only modified in the case for an open string closing up: because the strings form random walks and the endpoints are confined to the $(p+1)-$dimensional braneworld, the rate is proportional to $1/l^{p/2}$.
Furthermore, since the stack is in a fixed position within the transverse directions there is no additional $V_{\perp}$.

    \caption{Next to leading order hybrid interactions for strings probing the directions transverse to the brane (green line).}
    \label{fig:transverse-hybrid}
\end{figure}

The second order hybrid interactions require more thought. 
Consider an open string in a process open$\rightarrow$(open,closed) given by $l\rightarrow (l-l',l')$, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:transverse-hybrid}.
The total probability of the process will be given by the product of two probabilities. 
First, we must consider the probability that, chosen a point at a distance $l_x$ from an endpoint touches a point at a distance $l'+l_x$ from the same endpoint, which is given by $1/l'^{d/2}$.
Second, this point must belong to a random walk of length $l-l'$ that closes up in the directions transverse to the brane.
This is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \lr{\frac{l-l'}{l_x(l-l'-l_x)}}^{(d-p)/2}\, .
\end{equation}
Putting all of these terms together, we get (summing over all the possible points $l_x$ in which the interaction can occur):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim g_s^2\frac{1}{l'^{d/2}}\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl_x\, \lr{\frac{l-l'}{l_x(l-l'-l_x)}}^{(d-p)/2}} \, .
\end{equation}
where we have introduced a cutoff because our approximations break down for very small strings,\footnote{Note that the appearance of the cutoff in the upper limit is equally important, since it implies that as $l_x \to l-l_c$ there is an isolated string of length $l_c$ that is also formed.} but even if these were taken into account the length of the fundamental string would give a natural cutoff. Of course, understanding what the short strings are doing in the plasma
is a question of great interest. They include the radiation in the plasma
(which would correspond to a primordial signal in the cosmological context). We plan to  pursue this direction in the future.
\\

Consider now the inverse process of absorption of a closed string of length $l'$ by an open string of length $l-l'$. 
Similar considerations apply: the process can occur along any point within the closed string (giving a factor of $l'$), and a point separated a distance $l_x$ from the endpoint of the open string.
This point must belong to a random walk of length $l-l'$ that closes up in the transverse directions, and thus the contribution is
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Gamma}{dl}\sim g_s^2 \, l'\int_{l_c}^{l-l'-l_c}{dl_x\, \lr{\frac{l-l'}{l_x(l-l'-l_x)}}^{(d-p)/2}} \, .
\end{equation}
We will see that these two contributions indeed cancel in equilibrium as 
required by detailed balance.

Finally, we note that setting $p=0$ describes branes wrapped on compact
dimensions in effectively noncompact transverse dimensions. That is, the branes
are pointlike in all the dimensions we consider.

\section{The Boltzmann equations for highly excited strings}\label{sec:boltzmann}

In this section, we pose a system of Boltzmann equations for the number distribution of strings, $n_o(l)$ ($n_c(l)$) for open (closed) strings, where $n_i(l)dl$ is the number of strings in the system with length between $l$ and $l+dl$.
We will consider several increasingly complicated setups.
After a short discussion of the case studied by Lowe and Thorlacius~\cite{Lowe:1994nm} for closed strings that fill every direction (see also~\cite{Lee:1997iz} for the case with branes), we consider the case with $d$ effectively noncompact directions.
We later introduce D$p-$branes in the high and low density regimes. Since strings gravitate, there is the possibility of a Jeans instability --
as in \cite{Lowe:1994nm, Lee:1997iz} we will take the string coupling to be sufficiently small to avoid this\footnote{Our analysis
in this paper will be for Minkowski compactifications. Future studies will be in the context of an expanding universe, here the instabilility
is known of be milder and can also serve as a mechanism leading to the formation of primordial blackholes.}. 

In an ensemble of strings, there will be reactions involving strings of all lengths, so in order to look for detailed balance (and thus equilibrium solutions), we need to be careful to identify the two directions of the reaction $A\rightleftharpoons B+C$.
By doing so, using the interaction rates computed in Sec.~\ref{sec:decayrates}, we will see that detailed balance is satisfied for all channels.

Let us begin quoting the results of~\cite{Lowe:1994nm} for closed strings in zero noncompact directions.\footnote{The criterion to take dimensions compact/non-compact has been described
in the review subsection in the introduction of the article. The discussion  in the introduction was in the context of a single string. Here, the ensemble allows for arbitrary number of strings. Thus the relevant comparison is between  $(\bar{l})^{D/2}$ and the volume, $\bar{l}$ being the
length of the typical string.}
By assuming that interactions of long strings should be proportional to their length, and that interactions preserve length, the following equation was posed to describe an ensemble of highly excited strings wrapping many times the allowed volume, $V$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lowe-thorlacius}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial n(l)}{\partial t}=& \frac{\kappa}{V}\left\{-\frac{1}{2}l^2 n(l)
+\frac{1}{2}\int_0^l dl'\, l'n(l')(l-l')n(l-l') \right.\\
&\left.-ln(l)\int_0^\infty dl'\, l'n(l')+\int_0^\infty dl'\, (l+l')n(l+l')\right\}\\
=&\frac{\kappa}{2V}\int_0^l{dl'\, \lr{l'n(l')(l-l')n(l-l')-ln(l)\vphantom{\frac 12}}}\\ 
 &+\frac{\kappa}{V}\int_l^\infty{dl'\, \lr{l'n(l')-(l'-l)n(l'-l)ln(l)\vphantom{\frac 12}}}\, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The first line is the Boltzmann equation as given in \cite{Lowe:1994nm};
we have re-written the expression after the second equality for two reasons.
The first one is that writing the interactions in this way makes the generalization easier, so let us understand the terms one by one: the first line contains interactions with strings shorter than $l$, either a fusion of strings $(l',l-l')\to l$ in the first term, or by self-decay in the second term, where all possible product strings have the same probability.
This will change in the more general setups later.
Similarly, the second line contains interactions with strings longer than $l$, either the self decay of strings of length $l'$ into $l$ and $l'-l$, or the inverse process of fusion of strings $(l,l'-l)\to l'$. 

The second reason is that writing the equation in this form makes clear how detailed balance is organised.
Detailed balance operates length by length  (with the channels organised by $l'$). 
Once we realise this, the equilibrium solution to Eq.~\eqref{eq:lowe-thorlacius} is obvious
\begin{equation}
    n_{eq}(l)=\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l}\, .
\end{equation}
The length by length organisation of detailed balance is an important feature, we will see that it holds in all the settings that we will study
(and this will help us to arrive at the equilibrium solutions\footnote{Recall that in~\cite{Lowe:1994nm}, the equilibrium solution was found by taking a Laplace transform.
This kind of method to solve integral equations is not available in general.}) .
\\

Henceforth, we will ignore any compact dimensions completely. If there are
effectively compact dimensions (in addition to the effectively noncompact
dimensions), every self-intersection interaction is divided by the volume
of the compact dimensions (representing the probability of the two points
intersecting in the compact dimensions), the open string joining interactions
are divided by the volume of the longitudinal compact dimensions, and the
splitting interactions are divided by the volume of the transverse compact
dimensions. As a result, we can redefine the couplings by the compact volumes
(eg, $\kappa/V_c\to\kappa$), which means we use the couplings of the 
lower-dimensional effective theory. In the Boltzmann equation from 
\cite{Lowe:1994nm} above, we can simply remove $V$ and use the coupling
$\kappa$ of the $(0+1)$-dimensional theory. 


\subsection{Closed strings in arbitrary dimensions}
We are now in a position to pose Boltzmann equations in more complicated setups.
Let us consider an example of a contribution to $\partial n_c(l)/\partial t$, coming from the decay of any string of length $l'>l$.
All such contributions are summarized in the term

\begin{equation}
    \int_l^\infty{dl'\,\frac{d\Gamma_{c}}{dl}n_c(l')}\, ,
\end{equation}
which is indeed the number of product strings of length $l$ produced by a single string of length $l'$, times the number of such strings in the ensemble, and this is integrated
for all $l'>l$.

This can also be thought of as the probability that,
given a segment of length $l$ on the longer string, it closes.

With the previous comments in mind, using the worldsheet interaction rates of the previous section, we can write the Boltzmann equation in $d$ noncompact dimensions for closed strings in the absence of branes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmannclosed}
\begin{split}
     \frac{\partial n_c(l)}{\partial t}= & 
     \frac{1}{2} \int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl' \, \lr{\kappa_a\frac{n_c(l') l'\, n_c(l-l') (l-l')}{V}\, -\kappa_b ln_c(l) \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{d/2}}}   \\ &
     +\int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \,  \lr{\kappa_b l'n_c(l')\lr{\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}}^{d/2}-\kappa_a \frac{ln_c(l)(l'-l)n_c(l'-l)}{V} }} \, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We have grouped the terms so that the first line describes the reactions $l \rightleftharpoons (l',l-l')$ involving strings shorter than $l$, and the second line contains those involving longer strings, $l' \rightleftharpoons (l,l'-l)$.
The constants $\kappa_{a,b}\sim g_s^2$ are $d$-dependent and computable but not important for the present discussion; in general $d$, they are distinct for absorption and decay due to phase space from integrals.\footnote{Note the difference from the $d=0$ case as discussed in \cite{Lowe:1994nm}.}
Note how the random walk terms appear in the same footing as the volume, suggesting an interpretation in terms of an ``effective volume" where the interaction can occur.
A similar equation as Eq.~\eqref{eq:boltzmannclosed} was written in~\cite{Copeland:1998na}, taking into account the effects of the expansion of the Universe and trading the cutoff for a length $\eta$ in the decay rates, associated with small scale structure.
Interestingly, in our case $l_c \simeq 9l_s$ (see Appendix~\ref{sec:cutoff}) which suggests that highly excited strings are random walks to a very good approximation, with points only being correlated at a distance $\sim 9l_s$.

Detailed balance now requires the same condition for both channels,
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_b V n_c(l)l^{1+d/2}=\kappa_a n_c(l')l'^{1+d/2}n_c(l-l')(l-l')^{1+d/2}\, .
\end{equation}
This has the simple solution $n_c(x)=(\kappa_b V/\kappa_a)f(x)/x^{1+d/2}$ so that $f(x)f(y)=f(x+y)$. 
The most general continuous solutions are unit and exponential functions, but the only physically reasonable ones are those that decay exponentially
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq-dist-closed}
    n_c(l)=V \frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{1+d/2}}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is a constant to be discussed. 
The distribution resembles a Boltzmann distribution, but one must be careful in identifying $L$ directly with the temperature.
Instead, the general considerations of Eq.~\eqref{eq:noncompact-dos} at high energies require that we identify $1/L=\beta-\beta_H$.
We can nevertheless relate $L$ to an average energy density of the system, corrected by finite size effects. 
In zero dimensions, it is simply interpreted as the average length 
(which equals the average energy) of the strings, up to a constant: $L\simeq\langle l \rangle=\int_0^\infty{dl' \, l'n_c(l')}$.
In higher dimensions, it is the average energy density, corrected by the volume occupied by the string, $L\simeq\int_0^\infty{dl'\, (\kappa_a/\kappa_b V) (l'^{d/2}) l'n(l')}$.

\subsection{Open and closed strings for space-filling branes}
In this section we write the Boltzmann equation for a system with open and closed strings with space-filling or densely packed D$p$-branes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmannbrane}
\begin{split}
     \frac{\partial n_c(l)}{\partial t}= & +\frac{b}{2N}V_\perp\frac{n_o(l)}{l^{d/2}} -a\frac{N}{V_\perp}ln_c(l) \\ &
     +\frac{1}{2} \int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl' \,\lr{\kappa_a \frac{n_c(l') l'\, n_c(l-l') (l-l')}{V}\, -\kappa_b ln_c(l) \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{d/2}}}   \\ &
     + \int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \,  \lr{\kappa_b l'n_c(l')\lr{\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}}^{d/2}-\kappa_a \frac{ln_c(l)(l'-l)n_c(l'-l)}{V} }} \, \\ &
    +\int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \, \lr{\kappa_c \frac{(l'-l)n_o(l')}{l^{d/2}}  -\kappa_d \frac{ln_c(l)(l'-l)n_o(l'-l)}{V} }} \, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $N$ is the number of parallel, effectively overlapping D$p$-branes in the $d-p$ transverse directions.
These span a worldvolume $V_\parallel$, and the transverse volume is denoted $V_\perp$, which together yield a total volume $V=V_\parallel \cdot V_\perp$.
Like $\kappa$, $a$ and $b$ are computable constants but are order $\mathcal{O}(g_s)$. 
We have grouped the terms so that the first line describes the leading order contributions of an open string closing up and a closed string being chopped off by a brane, the second line contains the reaction $l \rightleftharpoons (l',l-l')$, the third line contains $l' \rightleftharpoons (l,l'-l)$ as before, and the fourth line describes an open string self-intersecting to yield a pair open-closed and absorption of a closed string by an open string (with corresponding coefficients $\kappa_c,\kappa_d$). 
\\

In a similar fashion, we can write the Boltzmann equation describing the interaction of open strings at second order in string perturbation theory,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmannopenbrane}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial n_o(l)}{\partial t}=&+a\frac{N}{V_\perp}ln_c(l)-\frac{b}{2N}V_\perp\frac{n_o(l)}{l^{d/2}}\\ 
        &+\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\, \lr{\frac{b}{2NV_\parallel}\, n_o(l')n_o(l-l')-a\frac{N}{V_\perp}n_o(l)}}\\ &
        +\int_{l+l_c}^{\infty}{dl'\, \lr{2a\frac{N}{V_\perp}n_o(l') -\frac{b}{NV_\parallel}n_o(l)n_o(l'-l)}} \\
        &+\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl' \lr{\kappa_d\frac{l'(l-l')n_c(l')n_o(l-l')}{V}-\kappa_c n_o(l)\frac{l-l'}{l'^{d/2}}}}\\
        &+\int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl'\lr{\kappa_c\frac{n_o(l')l}{(l'-l)^{d/2}}-\kappa_d\frac{ln_o(l)(l'-l)n_c(l'-l)}{V}}}\\
        &+\text{(2-2 interactions)},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the first line involves chopping off a closed string of length $l$ or an open string closing up, the second and third lines involve emission/absorption of open strings through the endpoints, the fourth and fifth line involves hybrid interactions as before, and the final line is 2-2 open string interactions that we discuss in Appendix~\ref{sec:22openstrings}.

In equilibrium, the form of $n_o(l)$ and $n_c(l)$ is fixed by detailed balance in any of the lines 
and yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:solbraneworld}
    n_c(l)=V\frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{d/2+1}}\, , \qquad n_o(l)=\frac{2a\kappa_b N^2V_\parallel}{b\kappa_a V_\perp}e^{-l/L}
\end{equation}
and a relationship between the interaction pre-factors:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}=\frac{\kappa_c}{\kappa_d}\, .
\end{equation}
Verifying this relationship from first principles would be a nontrivial check of the self-consistency of string theory.

It is worth remarking that, provided it is not zero, the string coupling does not appear in the equilibrium distributions~\eqref{eq:solbraneworld} since it cancels out in the ratios $a/b$ and $\kappa_a/\kappa_b$.
This agrees with the previous observation that our results hold to all orders in string perturbation theory.

\subsection{Open and closed strings with isolated branes}\label{sec:generalcase}

The previous setup was considered for strings moving in a $d$-dimensional 
space-filling D-brane (or, analogously, for strings so long that the separation between the branes in the transverse direction is negligible). 
In this section, we consider strings extending in the $(d-p)$-dimensional transverse volume without branes, as would occur in e.g. a toroidal compactification with a single stack of branes.

Using the interaction rates argued in Sec.~\ref{sec:decayrates}, we find
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmannclosedgeneral}
\begin{split}
     \frac{\partial n_c(l)}{\partial t}= & \frac{b}{2N}\frac{n_o(l)}{l^{p/2}} -a\frac{N}{V_\perp}ln_c(l) \\ &
      +\frac{1}{2} \int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl' \,\lr{\kappa_a\frac{n_c(l') l'\, n_c(l-l') (l-l')}{V}\, -\kappa_b ln_c(l) \lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{d/2}}}   \\ &
     + \int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \,  \lr{\kappa_bl'n_c(l')\lr{\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}}^{d/2}  -\kappa_a\frac{ln_c(l)(l'-l)n_c(l'-l)}{V} }} \, \\ &
    +\int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \, \int_{l_c}^{l'-l-l_c}{  \frac{dl_x }{\lr{l_x(l'-l-l_x)}^{(d-p)/2}}}}\left(\kappa_c \frac{n_o(l')l'^{(d-p)/2}}{l^{d/2}}\right. \\ &-\left. \kappa_d\frac{l n_c(l)}{V}n_o(l'-l)(l'-l)^{(d-p)/2}\right) \, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and 
\\
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial n_o(l)}{\partial t}=&+a\frac{N}{V_\perp}ln_c(l)-\frac{b}{2N}\frac{n_o(l)}{l^{p/2}}\\
        &+\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\lr{\frac{b}{2NV_\parallel}n_o(l')n_o(l-l')-aNn_o(l)\lr{\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}}^{(d-p)/2}}} \\ 
        &+\int_{l+l_c}^{\infty}{dl'\, \lr{2aNn_o(l')\lr{\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}}^{(d-p)/2} -\frac{b}{NV_\parallel }n_o(l)n_o(l'-l)}} \\
        &+\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}dl' \int_{l_c}^{l-l'-l_c}\frac{dl_x}{\lr{l_x(l-l'-l_x)}^{(d-p)/2}}\left(\kappa_d \frac{l'n_c(l')n_o(l-l')}{V}(l-l')^{(d-p)/2}\right.  \\ & \left.-\kappa_c\frac{n_o(l)}{l'^{d/2}}l^{(d-p)/2} \right) \\
        &+\int_{l+l_c}^\infty dl'\, \int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}  \frac{dl_x }{\lr{l_x(l-l_x)}^{(d-p)/2}}\left(\kappa_c\frac{n_o(l')}{(l'-l)^{d/2}}l'^{(d-p)/2}\right. \\ 
        & \left.-\kappa_d \frac{n_o(l)(l'-l)n_c(l'-l)}{V}l^{(d-p)/2}\right) \\
        & +\text{(2-2 interactions)}\, .
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Care is required when considering the powers of volume, but they follow from simple probability arguments.
It is immediate to show that the following distribution is an equilibrium solution
\begin{equation}\label{eq:solgeneral}
    n_c(l)=V\frac{\kappa_b}{\kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{1+d/2}}\, , \qquad n_o(l)=\frac{2a\kappa_bN^2V_\parallel}{b \kappa_a}\frac{e^{-l/L}}{l^{(d-p)/2}}\, .
\end{equation}

We study in detail the complicated contributions from 2-2 interactions in Appendix~\ref{sec:22openstrings}.

\section{Moving out of equilibrium: equilibration rates}\label{sec:perturbations}

Unlike other approaches to thermodynamics, Boltzmann equations allow us to 
study thermodynamics out of equilibrium, which has imporant applications,
for example, in cosmology. In this section, we illustrate non-equilibrium
thermodynamics of strings by considering the behaviour of fluctuations 
$\delta n (l,t)$ in the ensemble of strings, specifically finding the rate at
which these perturbations decay. 

We start by considering closed strings only because the Boltzmann equation is
simpler.
In zero noncompact dimensions, we show that the time required to reach equilibration depends on the length of the strings involved in the fluctuation, concluding that long strings equilibrate faster than short strings.
We do this by finding a family of analytic solutions that decay exponentially with a length-dependent rate $\Gamma(l)=\kappa(l^2/2+l L)/V$.
We then give a qualitative reason for this behaviour, and we conclude with similar arguments in the higher-dimensional cases.

We then turn to equilibration in the presence of D-branes, using the logic
developed with closed strings. Since splitting
and joining of open strings is lower order in string perturbation theory
than interchange interactions, equilibration of an open and closed string gas
is parametrically faster (by a factor of the string coupling) 
than equilibration of closed strings alone.

\subsection{Closed strings in only compact dimensions}

This section is dedicated to the study of the integro-differential equation obtained by linearizing~\eqref{eq:boltzmannclosed} around the equilibrium solution~\eqref{eq:eq-dist}, which we denote $\Bar{n}(l)$.
Namely, for $n(l,t)=\Bar{n}(l)+\delta n(l,t)$, we find at order $\mathcal{O}(\delta n)$ (writing $n_c(l)$ as $n(l)$ wherever there is no room for ambiguity):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffeq-f}
    \frac{V}{\kappa}\frac{\partial{ \delta n(l,t)}}{\partial t}=-\lr{\frac{l^2}{2}+lL}\delta n(l,t)+\int_0^l{dl'\, l'\delta n(l',t)\lr{e^{\frac{-(l-l')}{L}}-1}}-\delta E\lr{e^{-l/L}-1}\, ,
\end{equation}
where we have and assumed finiteness of the energy of the perturbation, defined by
\begin{equation}
    \delta E\equiv \int_0^\infty {dl'\, l' \delta n(l',t)}\, .
\end{equation}
In Appendix~\ref{sec:detail-perturbations} we find two sets of solutions to this equation by converting it into a second order partial differential equation.
These have the form (up to an overall constant):
\begin{gather}
    \delta n(l,t)=e^{-l/L}\, ,\label{equildiff}\\
    \delta n(l,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi(c+t L^2)}{2}}\frac{e^{-\frac{l}{L}+A(t)^2}}{L}\text{Erf}\lr{A(t),A(t)+\sqrt{\frac{c+t L^2}{2}}\frac{l}{L}}\, ,\label{erfsoln}
\end{gather}
where $\text{Erf}(z_1,z_2)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{z_1}^{z_2}{e^{-t^2}dt}$ is the incomplete error function, and
\begin{equation}
    A(t)=\sqrt{\frac{c+t L^2}{2}}\lr{1-\frac{1}{c+tL^2}}\, .
\end{equation}

The first solution for $\delta n(l,t)$ is simply the energy carried by strings between $l$ and $l+dl$.
This is the statement that energy is conserved in the interactions or, in the language of kinetic theory, that energy is a \textit{collisional invariant} (see e.g.~\cite{Tong:notes}). 
More interesting is the second solution, which shows the decay of a time-dependent configuration with a time-dependent decay rate $\Gamma (l)=\frac{\kappa}{V}\lr{\frac{l^2}{2}+l L}$.
\\

Notice, however, that the only fluctuations that tend to zero at late times 
are those with $\delta E=0$; the late time form with $\delta E\neq 0$ is
proportional to (\ref{equildiff}), which is the difference between two 
equilibrium solutions $\bar n(l)$ with infinitestimally different $L$.
Meanwhile, the energy of the configurations (\ref{erfsoln}) is
\begin{equation}
    E=\int_0^{\infty}{dl' \, l'\delta n(l',t)}=L\, ,
\end{equation}
which is time and $c$-independent (note that $c$ determines the time origin) 
and different than zero. 
To construct a zero energy fluctuation, one must therefore add a term carrying the opposite energy.
A term that is allowed by the equations is $e^{-l/L}/L$, and thus a physically relevant fluctuation for a system with zero energy is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zero-e-fluctuation}
    \delta n(l,t) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi(c+t L^2)}{2}}\frac{e^{-\frac{l}{L}+A(t)^2}}{L}\text{Erf}\lr{A(t),A(t)+\sqrt{\frac{c+t L^2}{2}}\frac{l}{L}}-\frac{e^{-l/L}}{L} \, ,
\end{equation}
up to an overall multiplicative constant that must be small to ensure $\delta n(l,t)\ll \Bar{n}(l)$.
Figure~\ref{fig:icfluctuation} illustrates the initial shape of the fluctuation for different times (equivalent
to different values of $c$).

        \label{fig:icfluctuation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Qualitative features}
Being able to obtain an analytic description of the evolution of fluctuations is a feature of the zero-dimensional case which does not carry through to more complicated situations.
However, the main features of Eq.~\eqref{erfsoln} can be argued from simple considerations that can be applied to the higher dimensional setup.

The starting point is Eq~\eqref{eq:diffeq-f}, where it is clear that zero energy perturbations satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zero-spreading}
    \frac{\partial{ \delta n(l,t)}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\kappa}{V}\lr{\frac{l^2}{2}+lL}\delta n(l,t)+\frac{\kappa}{V}\int_0^l{dl'\, l'\delta n(l',t)\lr{e^{\frac{-(l-l')}{L}}-1}}\, .
\end{equation}
There is a simple physical interpretation of this equation: the first term encodes the absorption of the fluctuation at $l$ by the bath, and the second term describes the propagation of the fluctuation in length space. While the second
term can redistribute the fluctuation, the first term should set the time
scale because it causes the fluctuation to decay everywhere.

We can also argue that the first term dominates as follows.
Expanding the exponential, the integral term is suppressed by powers of $(l-l')/L$, which is smaller than one except when $l\gtrsim L$, where (by consistency with $\delta n(l,t)\ll \Bar{n}(l)$) the fluctuation is exponentially suppressed.
The first term thus dominates, giving a qualitative behaviour
\begin{equation}
    \delta n(l,t)\sim \delta n (l,0)e^{-\frac{\kappa}{V}\lr{\frac{l^2}{2}+l L}t}\, ,
\end{equation}
as argued in~\cite{Lowe:1994nm}.
This qualitative behaviour is in agreement with our explicit solution, and applies for other zero energy fluctuations. 
We have indeed checked this for the initial perturbation $\delta n(l,0)=\cos\lr{2\pi l/L}-\cos \lr{8 \pi l/L}$ (with unphysical Dirichlet boundary 
conditions imposed at $l=0,L$), which carries zero energy.
The behaviour, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuation}, shows that long strings tend to equilibrate faster.

  \centering  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{evol-rara.pdf}
\caption{Evolution of the fluctuation $\delta n(l,0)=\cos\lr{2\pi l/L}-\cos \lr{8 \pi l/L}$ with $L=10$ and Dirichlet boundary conditions $\delta n (0,t)=\delta n(L,t)=0$.}
\label{fig:fluctuation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Closed strings in noncompact dimensions}
The qualitative description of the zero-energy fluctuations carried out in the previous section generalises to the higher dimensional case.
Consider now the linearization of~\eqref{eq:boltzmannclosed} around $\Bar{n}(l)=V e^{-l/L}/l^{1+d/2}$.
The evolution equation of the perturbation reads, up to $\mathcal{O}\lr{\delta n}$ terms (henceforth setting $\kappa_a=\kappa_b\equiv \kappa$ for simplicity):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearized-qualitative}
    \begin{split}
     \frac{\partial \lr{\delta n(l,t)}}{\partial t}= & 
     \kappa\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\,\lr{ (l-l')\Bar{n}(l-l')\,l'\delta n(l',t)-\frac{1}{2}\lr{\frac{l}{(l-l')l'}}^{d/2}l\delta n(l,t) }}
     \\ & 
     +\kappa \int_{l+l_c}^\infty{dl' \,  l'\delta n(l',t)\lr{\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}}^{d/2}}-\kappa l\delta n(l,t)\frac{E}{V} \, ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the energy of the background (with density assumed to be finite), and we have neglected a term proportional to the energy of the fluctuation (which we take to be zero for simplicity).
The decaying terms require no knowledge about the shape of the fluctuation: they simply state that the fluctuation can decay through self-interactions or through interactions with the background.
We can write those contributions as:
\begin{equation}\label{closedncboltz}
     \frac{\partial \lr{\delta n(l,t)}}{\partial t}= 
     -\kappa l\delta n(l,t) \lr{\frac{E}{V}+ \frac{1}{2}\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\,\lr{\frac{l}{(l-l')l'}}^{d/2} }}+ \text{(spreading)} \, ,
\end{equation}
and these set the equilibration rate whenever the spreading terms are negligible, as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:zero-spreading}.
We see two contributions to the equilibration rate, which is length-dependent,
as in the $d=0$ case. The first term is linear in the length and proportional
to the energy density $E/V$; note that the energy density is given by an
incomplete gamma function that depends only on the cutoff $l_c$ and length
scale $L$. The other integral can be written as a difference of incomplete
beta functions, though each beta function diverges for even $d\geq 2$.
Keeping terms of order $l/l_c$ or greater,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq}}}(l)&\simeq  \kappa\left(\frac EV l +\left\{
\begin{array}{cc} l^2/2 & (d=0)\\ (\pi/2)l^{3/2}-2\sqrt{l_c}l & (d=1)\\
l\ln(l/l_c-1) & (d=2)\\ 2ll_c^{1-d/2}/(d-2) & (d\geq 3)\end{array}\right. 
\quad\right) . \\
%    \Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq}}}(l)\simeq & \kappa l^{2-d/2} \lr{\int_\varepsilon^\infty {dx \, \frac{e^{-x l/L}}{x^{d/2}}}+\frac{1}{2}\int_\varepsilon^{1-\varepsilon}{dx\, x^{-d/2}(1-x)^{d/2}}}\\
%    &=\kappa l^{2-d/2}\lr{\frac{1}{2}B\lr{1-\varepsilon;1-\frac{d}{2},1-\frac{d}{2}}-\frac{1}{2}B\lr{\varepsilon;1-\frac{d}{2},1-\frac{d}{2}}+\lr{\frac{l}{L}}^{d/2-1}\Gamma\lr{\frac{l\varepsilon}{L};1-\frac{d}{2}}}\, ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This result agrees with the results at the beginning of this section for $d=0$.
For $d\geq 3$, the dominant contribution is given by the cutoff. 

We have assumed that half the terms --- those that spread the fluctuation ---
are unimportant in setting the equilibration time scale.
Those involve the spreading of the fluctuation through interactions with the background (first term in the first line in~\eqref{eq:linearized-qualitative}) or through self-decay (first term of the second line).
We cannot prove in general that these terms are always subdominant, but it is easy to see that spreading of localized fluctuations is not efficient. 
We show this in Appendix~\ref{sec:detail-perturbations}.
This argument, together with numerical results, supports the claim that the equilibration rate is given by the decaying terms. Heuristically, the reason is
that the spreading terms do not specifically move strings from overpopulated
to underpopulated values of length, which would aid in equilibration, but
rather simply change the shape of the perturbation. Hence it is the decaying
terms that set the equilibration rate.



\subsection{Open and closed strings}

Following similar considerations as before, we can study the equilibration rates of an ensemble of open and closed strings.
Since strings can split and join on D-branes at order $g_s$ in string 
perturbation theory, as opposed to the interaction of two points in the
bulk of strings at order $g_s^2$, mixed open/closed string gases can 
equilibrate parametrically faster than gases of closed strings alone.
The second order interactions for a linearized perturbation
become comparable in rate to the first order terms at best when the background
density of open strings is order $1/g_s$, in which case we should modify
the thermodynamics to include the creation and annihilation of D-branes.
As a result, we consider only the order $g_s$ interactions in this section
except for a brief comment while examining equilibration of open strings.

We will consider two types of interactions, those that transfer energy
between the open and closed string baths and those that equilibrate the open
strings. Even a perturbation that is initially entirely in the closed string
sector can equilibrate quickly by transfering energy to the open strings,
which then equilibrate rapidly. The closed strings equilibrate rapidly
with the open strings.

It seems that an open string Hagedorn phase in the early Universe could have had important consequences in reheating~\cite{Frey:2005jk}, the cosmological moduli problem and the dark radiation problem.
Similar conclusions have been reached through entropic arguments~\cite{Frey:2021jyo}. The results presented here are relevant for understanding departure
from equilibrium in such a cosmological scenario.


\subsubsection*{Transfer between open and closed strings}

Let us begin by restricting ourselves to interactions mixing the open and closed sector.
Since $a,\, b\sim g_s$ and $\kappa\sim g_s^2$, the dominant terms mixing open and closed strings read
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transfer}
    \frac{\partial \delta n_o}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial \delta n_c}{\partial t}=a\frac{N}{V_\perp}l\delta n_c(l,t)-\frac{b}{2N}\frac{W_o(l)}{W_c (l)}\delta n_o(l,t)+\cdots\equiv A(l)\delta n_c(l,t)-B(l)\delta n_o(l,t)\, ,
\end{equation}
where we have defined $W_o(l)\equiv \text{Min}(V_\perp,l^{(d-p)/2})$, $W_c(l)\equiv \text{Min}(V,l^{d/2})$ to cover all the cases we have considered (and $\cdots$
are open-open interactions).
If we consider mixing interactions only, the number of strings involved in the fluctuation 
$\delta N(l)\equiv \delta n_o(l) + \delta n_c(l)$ is conserved as a function of
$l$ since these interactions only modify the type of string and cannot change
length. It follows that these interactions can only equilibrate the
ratio of open to closed strings at each length; at late times,
$\delta n_o(l)\to (2aN^2/bV_\perp)(W_c(l)/W_o(l))\delta n_c(l)$, which is
the same as the ratio for equilibrium distributions $\bar n_o(l)/\bar n_c(l)$.

Next, let us turn to  the equilibration rate. We want to track the evolution of
 $\Delta(l,t) \equiv \delta n_o(l,t)-\delta n_c(l,t)$. 
From the structure of the mixing terms, it is easy to see that
$\Delta$ equilibrates exponentially with relaxation rate \begin{equation}
\Gamma(l) =a\frac{N}{V_\perp}l+\frac{b}{2N}\frac{W_o(l)}{W_c (l)} .
\end{equation}
Note that interactions among open strings at
a parametrically similar rate will change $\delta N(l)$, so we cannot ignore them in a physical evolution, but  $\Gamma$ will 
still set the typical relaxation rate for $\Delta$. 

An important conclusion is that this rapid relaxation rate means that the 
whole bath of open and closed strings can equilibrate rapidly through the
interactions of the open strings.
This might have important consequences in dark radiation overproduction and the cosmological moduli problem, particularly in the context of cosmologies that have a stringy epoch of reheating
(e.g.~\cite{Frey:2005jk,Frey:2021jyo}). In particular, it would also be interesting to analyse the interplay between the present scenario and models such as those presented in~\cite{Apers:2022cyl,Conlon:2022pnx} to solve the overshoot problem, where a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ energy density in string units is explicitly realized during the kination epoch.

\subsubsection*{Open string fluctuations}
Let us now move to the study of the decay of fluctuations in an ensemble of open strings, neglecting the interactions that mix with closed strings.
Thus, at first order in perturbation theory (\textit{i.e}, neglecting 2-2 interactions), the linearized Boltzmann equation for space-filling branes or all
compact dimensions reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq:openopen}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \delta n_o(l,t)}{\partial t}= &\cdots +
\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\lr{\frac{b}{NV_\parallel } \Bar{n}_o(l')\delta n_o(l-l',t)-a\frac{N}{V_\perp}\delta n_o(l,t)}} \\
   & +2a\frac{N}{V_\perp}\int_{l+l_c}^\infty {dl'\, \delta n_o(l',t)}-\frac{b}{NV_\parallel}\bar{N}_o\delta n_o(l,t) -\frac{b}{N V_\parallel}\Bar{n}_o(l)
\int_{l_c}^\infty dl' \delta n_o(l')\, ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{N}_o$ is the total number of open strings in the 
equilibrium solution (and $\cdots$ are the open-closed transfer interactions).
If, as before, we assume that the spreading terms do not contribute, we find 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq}}}(l)=\frac{2aN}{V_\perp}\lr{\frac{l}{2}+L}\, .
\end{equation}
For all compact dimensions, this is related to the equilibration rate of 
closed strings by
\begin{equation}\label{compacteqratio}
    \frac{\Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq,o}}}(l)}{\Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq,cl}}}(l)}= \frac{2aN}{\kappa l}V_\parallel \, .
\end{equation}
(The power of $l$ in the denominator is lower if any dimensions are 
non-compact.)

With a single stack of branes, the linearized Boltzmann equation is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \delta n_o(l,t)}{\partial t}=& 
\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c}{dl'\left(\frac{b}{NV_\parallel } \Bar{n}_o(l')\delta n_o(l-l',t)
-aN \delta n_o(l)\left(\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}\right)^{(d-p)/2}\right)}\\
&+2aN\int_{l+l_c}^\infty {dl'\, \delta n_o(l',t)\left(\frac{l'}{l(l'-l)}\right)^{(d-p)/2}}-\frac{b}{NV_\parallel}\bar{N}_o\delta n_o(l,t) -\frac{b}{N V_\parallel}\Bar{n}_o(l)
\int_{l_c}^\infty dl' \delta n_o(l')\, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In this case, the equilibration rate is
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\text{\tiny{eq}}}(l)=\frac{b}{N}\frac{\bar{N}_o}{V_\parallel}+aN
\int_{l_c}^{l-l_c} \left(\frac{l}{l'(l-l')}\right)^{(d-p)/2} ,
\end{equation}
where the open string density is given by an incomplete gamma function
and we recognize the second term as the integral in (\ref{closedncboltz}).
The ratio with the closed string equilibration rate is similar to that in
(\ref{compacteqratio}), except the incomplete gamma and beta functions
the open strings have lower effective dimensionality, which actually increases
the numerator.

It follows that open strings equilibrate much faster than closed strings for spacetime-filling or isolated branes (except for very long strings in $d<3$ 
noncompact dimensions). This justifies the picture we described at the start 
of this subsection: the open strings equilibrate quickly, and the interactions
mixing open and closed strings transfers that equilibrium to the closed string
sector. It is also worth noting that the ratio of equilibration rates
for the open string splitting and joining interactions to the open string
$2-2$ interactions is parametrically the same as (\ref{compacteqratio})
in all compact dimensions, following from the form of the interactions
given in appendix \ref{sec:22openstrings}.


\subsubsection*{An exact partial solution}

If all the dimensions are compact, the open string Boltzmann equation
at leading order in string perturbation theory is the combination of
equations (\ref{eq:transfer},\ref{eq:openopen}), as in \cite{Lee:1997iz}:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\frac{\partial n_o}{\partial t} =& \frac{aN}{V_\perp} ln_c(l) -
\frac{b}{2NV_\|} n_o(l)+\int_0^ldl'\left[\frac{b}{2NV_\|}n_o(l')n_o(l-l')
-\frac{aN}{V_\perp}n_o(l)\right]\\ 
&+\int_l^\infty dl'\left[\frac{2aN}{V_\perp}n_o(l') 
-\frac{b}{NV_\|}n_o(l)n_o(l'-l)\right] .
\end{split}\end{equation}
Integrating this equation over all lengths yields 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial N_o}{\partial t} = \frac{aN}{V_\perp}(E_c+E_o)-\frac{b}{2NV_\|}
(N_o+N_o^2)= \frac{b}{2NV_\|}\left(\bar{N}_o+\bar{N}_o^2-N_o-N_o^2\right)
\end{equation}
for the total number of open strings $N_o(t)$, where $E_c+E_o$ is the total
conserved energy and $\bar{N}_o$ is the equilibrium value.

Depending on whether the initial value is less or greater than the equilibrium
value, the number of open strings is
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
N_o(t) =& \left(\bar{N}_o+\frac 12\right)\tanh\left[\frac{b}{2NV_\|}
\left(\bar{N}_o+\frac 12\right)(t-t_0)\right]\quad\text{or}\\
N_o(t) =&\left(\bar{N}_o+\frac 12\right)\coth\left[\frac{b}{2NV_\|}
\left(\bar{N}_o+\frac 12\right)(t+t_0)\right] .\end{split}\end{equation}
In either case, the solution at late times is an exponentially decaying 
approach to equilibrium with a time scale approximately 
$b\bar{N}_o/NV_\| = 2aNL/V_\perp$. That is roughly the relaxation rate
at the typical length scale $L$
for either energy transfer between the open and closed strings or 
equilibration among open strings. The number $N_o$ of strings of course only 
carries a small amount of information about the equilibration of the whole
distribution of strings; however, it should relax with about the same time
scale, so this solution is a useful check on our above results.


\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have generalized the Boltzmann equation approach for perturbative string theory in a flat background.
Let us summarize our results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have started in Sec.~\ref{sec:general-argument} by describing the phase space of string theory in a toroidal background and, through a simple, background independent thermodynamic argument, found a simple equilibrium solution that confirms the free string computations.
    This equilibrium solution has been used as a proxy for the setup we have considered in the rest of the paper.
    \item In Sec.~\ref{sec:decayrates}, we have computed decay and absorption rates for typical strings at leading order in string perturbation theory, folowing~\cite{Manes:2001cs}.
    In particular, the form of the decay rate allowed us to argue that the thermodynamics is governed by long, nonrelativistic strings with winding and momentum modes which, for highly excited strings, give a negligible contribution to the total energy of the string.
    Furthermore, the shape of the interaction rates can be analyzed through simple random walk arguments that led us to conjecture the form of other interactions, which for technical reasons are very hard to compute. As we see later, these conjectured interaction rates pass a nontrivial consistency check of satisfying detailed balance, so a worldsheet derivation would be very interesting.
\item  In Sec.~\ref{sec:boltzmann}, we have posed a system of        Boltzmann equations describing three different setups: first, we have considered a compactification with no D-branes and $d$ effectively noncompact dimensions.
    Second, we introduced space-filling D-branes in the framework. The same setup applies for parallel D$p$-branes at sufficiently high energies, where the open strings are so long compared to the typical brane separation that they probe the whole transverse space. This case should also be similar, for instance, to strings at the tip of a Klebanov-Strassler throat, used in string compactifications to create hierarchies among energy scales~\cite{Klebanov:2000hb,Giddings:2001yu}.
    Third, we have allowed the open strings to probe the transverse directions (or, analogously, reduced the energy so that the typical string is shorter than the interbrane separation).
    All of these equations admit equilibrium solutions compatible with our general argument. 
    This shows the validity of the approximation of describing the typical string by its length and of our conjectured form for decay rates.
\item Lastly, we have given a taste of out-of-equilibrium physics in Sec.~\ref{sec:perturbations} by studying the behaviour of an ensemble of closed strings under zero-energy perturbations, which are to be interpreted as fluctuations.
    We have obtained an analytic expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:zero-e-fluctuation} for such fluctuations, and computed its equilibration rate.
    The intuition we developed in the $d=0$ case in absence of branes has allowed us to infer the behavior of equilibration rates in more complicated situations.
    In particular, we argued that, in a situation where open and closed strings are present, equilibration proceeds rapidly in the open string sector, and closed strings equilibrate via rapid interactions with the open strings.
    This result agrees with equilibrium notions but provides a dynamical mechanism for the approach to equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

The main goal of this paper is to develop the technology of the Boltzmann equation and illustrate its power.
Many future directions are now open -- both of  phenomenological and formal character.
The computation of the gravitational wave background that would arise as a consequence of strings in the phases we have studied is under progress~\cite{Frey:2024in}.
Other interesting directions include the  extension of our results to more complicated backgrounds (such as warped throats), explicit realizations of models of string gas cosmology~\cite{Brandenberger:1988aj, Brandenberger:2006vv, Brandenberger:2006xi, Nayeri:2005ck}, a recent variation \cite{Melcher:2023kpd}, and cosmologies
with epochs with of stringy reheating~\cite{Frey:2005jk, DiMarco:2019czi,Apers:2022cyl,Conlon:2022pnx}
(see~\cite{Cicoli:2023opf, Brandenberger:2023ver} for recent reviews on string cosmology).
Our results when appropriately generalized  should be useful  for the cosmic string community. Finally, it would be interesting to carry out worldsheet computations to verify conjectures about scattering processes we have made based on the random walk picture of highly excited strings.

\section{Motivation and summary}
\label{section1}

The best candidate for dark matter (DM) in supersymmetric models with R-parity conservation is the lightest neutralino $\chi_1^0$, which is generically the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Neutralinos are weakly interacting particles (WIMPs) which, in the standard thermal picture, are assumed to be in equilibrium with the thermal bath in a radiation dominated universe. As the universe expands, it cools down and at some point the temperature drops below the WIMP mass $m_\chi$. At that moment neutralinos become non-relativistic and their abundance per comoving volume decreases due to the Boltzmann factor $\exp\left(-m_\chi/T\right)$ until it reaches its freeze-out value at the temperature $T_{\rm f}$ which is typically of order $T_{\rm f} \simeq m_\chi/20$. This happens when the WIMP annihilation rate becomes of order the Hubble parameter $H$ and DM particles drop out of thermal equilibrium. 

Hence the thermally produced DM abundance depends just on its thermal averaged annihilation rate $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle$:
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \Omega^{\rm obs} \,\frac{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle^{\rm th}}{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle} \,,
\label{eq:ThermalAbundance}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^{\rm obs} \simeq 0.23$ is the abundance observed by the Planck satellite \cite{Ade:2015xua}, while $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle^{\rm th} = 3 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{cm}^3 \,\text{sec}^{-1}$ is the reference value which gives the correct relic abundance. This makes the thermal scenario very predictive and completely independent of the previous thermal history of the universe.

From \eqref{eq:ThermalAbundance} we can see that:
\begin{equation}
\Omega \simeq 0.23\ \frac{\alpha^2/(200 \, \rm{ GeV})^2}{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = g_2^2/(4\pi)$. Given that $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle \simeq \alpha^2/m_\chi^2$, weakly interacting particles with masses around the weak scale $m_\chi\sim m_{\rm weak}\sim{O}(100)$ GeV naturally give rise to the observed DM relic density. This fact is very well known in the literature under the name of ‘WIMP miracle’ and it suggests that new degrees of freedom at the weak scale are natural DM candidates.

However, in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), WIMP candidates do not really satisfy the condition $m_\chi\sim m_{\rm weak}$: thermal higgsinos saturate the DM relic density for masses around $1$ TeV, while winos need to be around $2.5$ - $3$ TeV. The situation for binos is even worse because their annihilation cross section is so small that they always overproduce DM.\footnote{That is also the case of singlinos in SUSY models with an extra scalar like the NMSSM.} This problem can be avoided either by focusing on fine-tuned corners of the underlying parameter space, like A-funnels or coannihilation with other sparticles, or by considering so-called well tempered combinations of electroweakinos which can lead to the correct DM abundance. However, recent direct detection results show that these scenarios are either under siege or directly ruled out. Thus a correct thermal production of the observed DM abundance seems to require a high level of fine-tuning. 

In the present paper we shall therefore consider a different production mechanism based on a non-standard cosmological evolution of our universe. More precisely, we shall consider the situation where DM particles are produced via a non-thermal mechanism based on the late time decay of heavy scalars with only gravitational couplings to ordinary matter. This production mechanism is well motivated from both a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. Since current observations can trace back the thermal history of the universe only up to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), when the temperature of the thermal bath was around $T_{\rm BBN} \simeq 3$ MeV, there is no reason in principle to assume a standard cosmological evolution for temperatures above $T_{\rm BBN}$. In particular, the generic presence of gravitationally coupled particles (like moduli or gravitinos) in UV complete theories like string theory, can change the cosmological evolution of our universe.

Moduli are scalar fields that get displaced from their late-time minimum during inflation due to the inflationary energy density \cite{Dine:1995kz}. After the end of inflation, their VEV decreases following the Hubble parameter $H$ until $H$ becomes of order their mass and the moduli start oscillating around their late-time minimum. Since their energy density redshifts as matter, they quickly come to dominate the energy density of the universe, introducing a new era of matter domination before BBN. Finally, these moduli decay when $H$ becomes of order their decay rate $\Gamma_\phi \simeq m_\phi^3/M_p^2$ with $M_p=2.4 \times 10^{18}$ GeV. The decay of the moduli heats the thermal bath and produces entropy diluting everything that has been produced before. Moreover, the moduli decay leads also to the non-thermal production of the lightest neutralino. 

This scenario gives rise to an interesting cosmological evolution of the universe which has been vastly studied in the literature \cite{McDonald:1989jd,Chung,Moroi:1999zb,Giudice:2000ex,kamionkowski-turner,Moroi,Drees,Khalil,Fornengo:2002db,Pallis:2004yy,endo,kohri,Gelmini:2006pw,Gelmini:2006pq,dutta,Acharya:2009zt,Arcadi:2011ev,Fan:2013faa,Blinov:2014nla,Kane:2015jia}. In the non-thermal scenario, differently from the thermal case, the DM relic density depends on two parameters: the WIMP annihilation rate and the reheating temperature (or equivalently the moduli mass). This additional parameter gives enough freedom to reproduce the observed DM relic density for neutralino masses of order $m_\chi \simeq m_{\rm weak}$. Given that non-thermally produced WIMPs can be light, this scenario turns out to be interesting for DM indirect detection and collider physics bounds. We will show that this new ‘WIMP miracle’ can happen only if the moduli masses are around $10^6$ - $10^7$ GeV. The ‘naturalness’ of this energy scale for the moduli masses depends on moduli stabilisation (and therefore ultimately on the string landscape).

The first part of the paper is a model independent analysis of non-thermal higgsino DM,\footnote{Higgsinos are good DM candidates in models like split-SUSY where there is a hierarchy between electroweakinos and scalars \cite{Wells:2003tf}. Moreover, light higgsinos are well motivated in natural SUSY scenarios \cite{Hall:2011aa}.} leaving the wino and bino DM cases for future work. The main conclusions of this model independent analysis are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The observed DM relic density can be saturated even for higgsino masses as low as $100$ GeV.

\item The strongest lower bound on the mass of non-thermal higgsinos comes from indirect detection which requires $m_\chi \gtrsim 300$. This bound comes from the non-observation by Fermi-LAT \cite{Ackermann:2015zua} of gamma rays due to dark matter annihilation from dwarf spheroidal galaxies where the dependence on the astrophysical profile is less important than in galactic centre observations.

\item We also show that future observations from Fermi-LAT or CTA \cite{Carr:2015hta} could cover essentially the entire parameter space of this scenario. Moreover, unlike the thermal case, collider signals from the LHC can probe only a small part of the parameter space using monojet plus soft lepton searches \cite{Baer:2014kya}. On the other hand, a $100$ TeV machine could test directly all the parameter space using monojet and disappearing tracks searches \cite{Low:2014cba}.
\end{enumerate}

In the second part of the paper we go into a model dependent discussion. We study the non-thermal post-inflationary cosmological evolution of two well-established scenarios of string moduli stabilisation: KKLT \cite{Kachru:2003aw} and the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}. In both cases, we determine the mass hierarchy between moduli, higgsinos and other sparticles. The main difference between these two scenarios is that in LVS the late decaying particle is the lightest modulus while in KKTL it is the gravitino. At the level of non-thermal DM production this does not change anything but it has consequences on setting the gaugino and SUSY-breaking scale. In each case, we have also worked out the consequences of preserving the BBN results in the presence of late decaying particles \cite{CMP}. The main conclusions can be summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the visible sector is localised on D7-branes, both cases lead to non-thermal DM overproduction, and so R-parity violation is mandatory.

\item If the visible sector is localised on D3-branes, both KKLT and LVS models can give rise to an allowed region of the parameter space where non-thermally produced light higgsinos can correctly reproduce the observed DM abundance. 

\item LVS models with the visible sector on D3-branes are particularly interesting since the hierarchy between the lightest modulus and the SUSY particles allows to set bounds from DM direct detection which however depend on the moduli VEVs (and so they are less constraining than the ones from indirect detection and collider searches). We have performed an analysis for a particularly well motivated value of the volume of the extra-dimensions and the result is twofold: $(i)$ in order to obtain constraints which are stronger than the ones from indirect detection, one would need data from large scale DM direct detection experiments (beyond $1$ Ton); $(ii)$ a large portion of the parameter space falls below the neutrino background, and so DM direct detection experiments seem to be less useful in this case.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Dark matter in a non-standard cosmology}
\label{section2}

Moduli are scalar fields that couple to all other particles only gravitationally. During inflation, they are displaced from their minimum because of the inflationary energy density. After the end of inflation, once their mass becomes comparable to the Hubble scale ($m_\phi \sim H$), the Hubble friction ceases to be the dominant effect and the moduli start to oscillate around their minimum. After some oscillations the moduli evolution is indistinguishable from pressureless matter and the moduli number per comoving volume remains constant. Hence moduli redshift as matter, with an initial abundance given by:
\begin{equation}
\rho_\phi = \frac12 \,m_\phi^2\, \phi_0^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $\phi_0$ is the initial misalignment which is in general of order $\phi_0 \sim M_p$ \cite{Dine:1995kz}. After the beginning of the oscillations, the moduli quickly come to dominate the energy density of the universe which therefore becomes matter dominated. When the Hubble parameter becomes of order the moduli decay rate, i.e. $H \sim \Gamma_\phi \simeq m_\phi^3/M_p^2$, these fields decay and a new radiation dominated era begins. This scenario changes the standard cosmological picture because it introduces extra matter dominated epochs between the end of inflation and the BBN epoch. 

The reheating temperature $T_{\rm r}$ of the final radiation dominated era before the BBN epoch is set by the decay $\Gamma_\phi$ of the lightest modulus into Standard Model light degrees of freedom (and possible superpartners): $T_{\rm r} \simeq \sqrt{\Gamma_\phi M_p}$. This non-standard cosmology can potentially modify the DM relic abundance if the WIMP freeze-out temperature $T_{\rm f}$ is larger than the reheating temperature from moduli decay: $T_{\rm f} > T_{\rm r}$. In this case, the freeze-out mechanism takes place during a matter dominated, instead of a standard radiation dominated, era. Moreover, the moduli decay dilutes the neutralino relic density due to entropy production giving \cite{Giudice:2000ex,McDonald:1989jd}: 
\begin{equation}
\Omega \simeq \frac{T_{\rm f}}{T_{\rm f,new}}\left(\frac{T_{\rm r}}{T_{\rm f,new}}\right)^3 \Omega^{\rm th}\,,
\label{dilut}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^{\rm th}$ is the standard thermal DM relic density, while $T_{\rm f} \simeq m_\chi/20$ and $T_{\rm f,new}$ is the new freeze-out temperature taking into account the entropy production due to the decay of the lightest modulus. By solving the Boltzmann equations it can however be shown that the difference between $T_{\rm f}$ and $T_{\rm f,new}$ is relevant only for $T_{\rm r} < 1$ GeV \cite{Gelmini:2006pq}. This scenario has been classified under the name of \textit{thermal production without chemical equilibrium} \cite{Gelmini:2006pw}. 

Nevertheless, this dilution is not the only effect produced by the presence of a late time decaying scalar. The direct or indirect decay of moduli into neutralinos yields also a non-thermal production that gives an extra contribution to the neutralino DM abundance. Depending on how efficiently neutralinos annihilate at the time of reheating, i.e. on whether the DM pair annihilation rate $\Gamma_\chi = n_\chi \langle \sigma v \rangle$ is larger or smaller than the expansion rate $H$ at $T_{\rm r}$, DM non-thermal production can follow two scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If DM particles annihilate very efficiently during the modulus decay, i.e. $\Gamma_\chi > H(T_{\rm r})$, there is a period of chemical equilibrium generated by the combination of the modulus decay and DM annihilation. This period continues until $\Gamma_\chi \sim H$, when DM annihilation is no longer efficient and neutralinos go out of chemical equilibrium (this is usually called \textit{non-thermal freeze-out}). At this point, the neutralino abundance per comoving volume reaches its definitive value. This scenario was first studied in \cite{McDonald:1989jd,Moroi:1999zb,Giudice:2000ex} and received several names: \textit{non-thermal production with chemical equilibrium} \cite{Gelmini:2006pw}, \textit{annihilation scenario} \cite{Kane:2015jia} or \textit{re-annihilation scenario} \cite{Cheung:2010gj}.
 
\item If DM particles produced from the modulus decay do not interact further, i.e. $\Gamma_\chi < H(T_{\rm r})$, their abundance is just the one produced by the modulus decay. Since there is no efficient annihilation, the DM number density per comoving volume is frozen from the beginning. This scenario has been known both as \textit{non-thermal production without chemical equilibrium} \cite{Gelmini:2006pw} and as \textit{branching scenario} \cite{Kane:2015jia}.
\end{enumerate}

The DM abundance per comoving volume for both scenarios can be expressed as \cite{Moroi:1999zb}:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{n_\chi}{s}\right) = \text{min} \left[\left(\frac{n_\chi}{s}\right)^{\rm obs} \, \frac{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle^{\rm th}}{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle} \, \sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_{\rm f})} {g_*(T_{\rm r})}} \, \frac{T_{\rm f}}{T_{\rm r}}, \, Y_\phi \text{Br}_{\chi}\right] \,,
\label{eq:NonThermalAbundance}
\end{equation}
where $\left(\frac{n_\chi}{s}\right)^{\rm obs} \simeq \Omega^{\rm obs} \, \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm crit}}{m_\chi s_0 h^2}\right)$, while $Y_\phi \simeq \frac{3 T_{\rm r}}{4 m_\phi}$ is the yield of particle abundance from modulus decay and Br$_\chi$ is the branching ratio of the modulus decay into DM particles (interpreted as the averaged number of DM particles produced per modulus decay). The annihilation scenario corresponds to the first term in \eqref{eq:NonThermalAbundance}, while the branching scenario is described by the second term of the same expression.

As we have already mentioned, the efficiency of DM annihilation determines whether DM is non-thermally produced in the annihilation or in the branching scenario. In particular, the condition $\Gamma_\chi > H(T_{\rm r})$ can be understood as:
\begin{equation}
n_\chi (T_{\rm r}) > \frac{H(T_{\rm r})}{\langle \sigma v \rangle}=\frac{\Gamma_\phi}{\langle \sigma v \rangle}\,,
\end{equation}
where $n_\chi (T_{\rm r}) = \text{Br}_{\chi} n_\phi(T_{\rm r}) =  \text{Br}_{\chi} \rho_\phi(T_{\rm r})/m_\phi $. Using the definition of $T_{\rm r}$ and assuming that the modulus thermalises immediately after its decay, this condition can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\langle \sigma v \rangle} < \text{Br}_\chi\ \frac{\pi^2}{30}\ T_{\rm r}^{4/3} M_p^{2/3}\,.
\label{cond1}
\end{equation}
For $T_{\rm f}>T_{\rm r}$, the condition to be in the annihilation regime, without any loss of generality, becomes: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\langle \sigma v \rangle} < \text{Br}_\chi\ \left(\frac{m_\chi}{ \text{1 GeV}}\right)^{4/3} 10^{10}\ \text{GeV}^2\,.
\label{Eqcond}
\end{equation}
Using the s-wave approximation for the annihilation cross section, we can estimate the regime of masses for which different neutralinos satisfy this condition. From pure winos, higgsinos and binos, it is easy to see that \cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb}:
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm wino} < \left( \frac{3 g^4}{16 \pi} \text{Br}_\chi\ 10^{10} \right)^{3/2} \text{GeV} \simeq 10^{12}\ \text{Br}_{\chi}^{3/2}\ \text{GeV}\,,
\label{winos}
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation} 
m_{\rm higgsino} < \left( \frac{g^4}{512 \pi} (21+3\tan^2\theta_W +11\tan^4\theta_W) \text{Br}_{\chi}\ 10^{10} \right)^{3/2} \text{GeV} \simeq 10^{11}\ \text{Br}_\chi^{3/2}\ \text{GeV}\,.
\label{higgsinos}
\end{equation}
Unless the branching ratio $\text{Br}_\chi$ is very small, the conditions \eqref{winos} and \eqref{higgsinos} clearly indicate that winos and higgsinos are always non-thermally produced in the annihilation scenario. The case of binos is instead slightly more model dependent since the condition to be satisfied for being in the annihilation scenario depends on the slepton mass $m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}$: 
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm bino}>\left(\frac{40\pi}{3g^4 \tan^2\theta_W} \frac{1}{10^{10}\ \text{Br}_\chi} \left(\frac{m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}}{\text{1 GeV}}\right)^4 \right)^{3/10} \text{GeV} \simeq 7\times 10^{-3}\ \text{Br}_\chi^{-3/10} \left(\frac{m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}}{\text{1 GeV}}\right)^{6/5} \, \text{GeV}\,.
\label{binos}
\end{equation}
For $m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}\simeq 100$ GeV (using LEP bounds), the condition to be in the annihilation scenario becomes $m_{\rm bino} > 1.82\ \text{Br}_\chi^{-3/10}$ GeV which basically includes all cases. In order to be in the branching scenario, it is necessary to be have either $\text{Br}_\chi\ll1$ or to go to multi-TeV sleptons. For example for $m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}\simeq 1$ TeV, binos get non-thermally produced in the branching scenario if $m_{\rm bino} < 29\ \text{Br}_\chi^{-3/10}$ GeV, while for $m_{\tilde{l}_{\rm r}}\simeq 10$ TeV, it is necessary to have $m_{\rm bino} < 458\ \text{Br}_\chi^{-3/10}$ GeV.

As a consequence, in the annihilation scenario the DM relic abundance due to moduli decay depends on the neutralino annihilation efficiency at $T_{\rm r}$ and it can be written as \cite{Gelmini:2006pw}:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^{\rm nt} =\sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_{\rm f})} {g_*(T_{\rm r})}} \,\frac{T_{\rm f}}{T_{\rm r}} \ \Omega^{\rm th}\,,
\label{NTann}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^{\rm th}$ is the expression for the thermal relic density. On the other hand, for the branching scenario the DM relic density depends on the averaged number of neutralinos per modulus decay but not on the annihilation cross section:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^{\rm nt} h^2 =1.5\times 10^2\ \text{Br}_\chi\ \left( \frac{T_{\rm r}}{\text{GeV}}\right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{\text{ GeV}}\right) \kappa^{1/3}\,,
\label{NTann2}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ (which is typically of order one) parametrises the model dependence of the modulus decay $\Gamma_\phi =\kappa\ m_\phi^3/M_p^2$.\footnote{Note that $\kappa$ should also appear in (\ref{Eqcond}) but, given that it plays no significant role in that expression, we ignored it for the sake of simplicity.} Note that the DM relic abundance does not overclose the universe only for a very small $\text{Br}_\chi$. In order to avoid fine-tuning issues, such a small number should be justified by a proper theoretical motivation.



\section{Non-thermal higgsino dark matter}
\label{sec:IndirectDetection}

In this section we focus on the analysis of the higgsino LSP case. A mainly higgsino-like neutralino scenario is characterised by a spectrum where the lightest sparticles are the first two neutralinos $\chi_1^0$, $\chi_2^0$ and the first chargino $\chi_1^\pm$. All of them are dominated by the higgsino component and their masses are very close. The degree of degeneracy between the masses depends mainly on the mass of the bino $M_1$ and wino $M_2$: the heavier they are the more degenerate $\chi_1^0$, $\chi_2^0$, $\chi_1^\pm$ will be. 

Let us point out that we shall not consider well-tempered higgsino-gaugino scenarios since they are in strong tension with recent direct detection data. In fact, LUX sets a lower bound on gaugino masses, depending on whether the lightest gaugino is the bino or the wino \cite{lux}. For thermal higgsinos with mass of order $\mu \sim$ 1 TeV, in the higgsino-bino case, $M_1 > 1.2$ TeV in most of the parameter space, while in the higgsino-wino scenario, $M_2>1.6$ GeV \cite{diCortona:2014yua,Badziak:2015qca}. These bounds can be escaped only in a small region with $\mu<0$ and $\tan\beta\leq 2$. However, XENON1T (which will release data probably this year) should be able to probe also this remaining region. Let us finally mention that the LUX bounds on gaugino masses for the higgsino LSP case indicate that the masses of $\chi_1^0$, $\chi_2^0$, $\chi_1^\pm$ are quite close to each other. This has an important impact on collider phenomenology, as we will describe in Sec. \ref{CollPheno}.

Due to the bino/wino bounds mentioned above, from now on we will assume that the LSP is mainly higgsino.\footnote{Note that we are not even assuming MSSM. Even in more complicated SUSY models like NMSSM or beyond, the only assumption is a higgsino LSP.} The rest of the spectrum in this scenario could be either as light as the lightest gauginos like in natural SUSY scenarios \cite{Hall:2011aa}, or it could feature very heavy sfermions like in split-SUSY models \cite{Wells:2003tf}. The second (and last) assumption that we will make is the presence of moduli which can give rise to a non-thermal cosmological history as explained in Sec. \ref{section2}.


\subsection{Indirect detection constraints}

Given that the higgsino LSP case does not need to assume any value of the bino or wino mass (beyond the LUX bounds), the constraints coming from DM direct detection are not very useful. In other words, these bounds are model/spectrum dependent. That is the reason why we are going to focus only on indirect detection constraints and collider signals. In Sec. \ref{sec:DirectDetection} we will discuss some models from UV stringy completions and we will analyse the impact of DM direct detection constraints in terms of the spectrum generated by such stringy scenarios.

The green and orange regions correspond instead to CTA prospects. The plot on the right is a zoom on the region with $T_{\rm r}\leq10$ GeV.}
\label{figInd}
\end{figure}


In Fig. \ref{figInd} we show the results of the analysis of the higgsino LSP scenario in a non-standard cosmology where the lightest modulus decays and reheats the universe at a given $T_{\rm r} \sim \sqrt{m_\phi^3/M_p}$. As mentioned in Sec. \ref{section2}, depending on the relation between $T_{\rm r}$ and the higgsino mass (through $T_{\rm f} \simeq m_\chi/20$), the effect on the DM relic abundance changes. In Fig. \ref{figInd} we show that for $T_{\rm r} > T_{\rm f}$, i.e. for values above the diagonal dashed grey line (which corresponds to $T_{\rm r} = T_{\rm f}  = m_\chi/20$), there is no effect from the presence of moduli. In fact, they would decay before the higgsino thermal freeze-out, and so they would not affect the standard DM thermal production.

However, for $T_{\rm r} < T_{\rm f}$ the modulus decay has a double effect: it dilutes the higgsino relic abundance generated by the thermal freeze-out (the so-called thermal production without chemical equilibrium) and, at the same time, it decays into higgsinos increasing their abundance (the so-called annihilation scenario or non-thermal production with chemical equilibrium). These effects are antagonistic since the former reduces the DM relic density while the second tends to increase it (see \eqref{dilut} and \eqref{NTann}). The combination of these two effects is plotted in Fig. \ref{figInd}. The light blue area of the plot is the region of the parameter space where DM is overproduced, and the blue solid line represents the region where the DM abundance observed by Planck is saturated. The dashed cyan and violet lines represent the regions of the parameter space where higgsino-like DM constitutes only the $50\%$ and $20\%$ of the total DM content. 

If we focus on the solid blue line, it can be seen that, for $T_{\rm r} < T_{\rm f}$, the region with $40$ GeV $\lesssim T_{\rm r} \lesssim 55$ GeV is dominated by the thermal production without chemical equilibrium, i.e. the modulus decay does not heavily dilute the previous thermal higgsino production. As a consequence, in that region of parameter space higgsino DM is overproduced due to the additional DM component coming from the decay of the modulus into higgsinos. Note that the discontinuity of the solid blue line in this region of parameter space has no physical meaning since it is just due to the technical difficulty to consider both non-thermal effects.

At $T_{\rm r} \simeq 38$ GeV (when the modulus mass is $m_\phi \simeq {O} (10^7) $ GeV) the effect of the dilution reduces the thermal relic abundance to half of its initial freeze-out value and, at the same time, the non-thermal production generates precisely the other half required to saturate the DM relic density observed by Planck. From this point on (decreasing $T_{\rm r}$) the effect of the dilution is bigger and bigger, leaving more space for a non-thermal production. In particular, for $T_{\rm r} \simeq 4$ GeV the modulus decay has diluted $80\%$ of the previous thermal DM production, and so most of the DM abundance is due to non-thermal production. From \eqref{dilut} and \eqref{NTann} it is easy to understand that when the annihilation scenario becomes the dominant effect (for lower temperatures), lighter higgsinos are needed to generate the correct DM relic density.

However, there are limits on how light these higgsinos can be. The first is the LEP bound on direct production of charginos, represented in Fig. \ref{figInd} by the grey band, which requires $m_\chi \gtrsim 100$ GeV. Moreover, for light higgsinos which saturate the DM relic density, indirect detection constraints have an important impact. We have analysed this kind of constraints by first computing the thermal averaged cross section of higgsinos with \texttt{micrOMEGAs} \cite{Belanger:2013oya}, and then using the bounds from Fermi-LAT data and the prospects on future experiments like CTA (we have used the limits reported in \cite{Carr:2015hta,Lefranc:2015pza,Silverwood:2014yza}). 

The result is shown in Fig. \ref{figInd}, where we show that the bound coming from Fermi-LAT data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies (Fermi-LAT dSph) sets a lower bound on the higgsino mass of order $m_\chi \gtrsim 300$ GeV \cite{Ackermann:2015zua}. This bound corresponds to $T_{\rm r} \simeq 2$ GeV, which in terms of the modulus mass is $m_\phi \simeq 2\times 10^6$ GeV. Fermi-LAT dSph is the most robust bound given that it does not depend on the DM astrophysical profile and possible astrophysical uncertainties are already taken into account in the limits offered by this collaboration. Fig. \ref{figInd} shows also the Fermi-LAT limit due to the non-observation of DM annihilation from the galactic centre (Fermi-LAT GC) \cite{Gomez-Vargas:2013bea}. This bound ($m_\chi \gtrsim 625$ GeV) is instead very dependent on the actual DM astrophysical profile. In particular, we plot the contracted NFW (NFW$_c$) profile which corresponds to the most cuspy one. Due to the problems on sub-halo galactic structures, cuspy profiles seem to become less motivated \cite{Oh:2015xoa}. Nevertheless, we plot this bound because any other (more cored) profile gives a bound below the Fermi-LAT dSph one. Finally, we also show possible bounds coming from future indirect detection experiments like CTA, which again correspond to cuspy DM astrophysical profiles because the cored ones are below the one set by Fermi-LAT data from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

\subsection{Collider phenomenology}
\label{CollPheno}

At the beginning of this section we pointed out that the spectrum of a typical higgsino LSP scenario is characterised by a light higgsino doublet with almost degenerate neutralinos and charginos $\chi_1^0$, $\chi_2^0$ and $\chi_1^\pm$. On the other hand, the rest of the spectrum is heavier and in principle free.\footnote{In the MSSM scalars should be at least at $2$ TeV to have a $125$ GeV Higgs \cite{Vega:2015fna} but in the NMSSM they could be lighter \cite{Hall:2011aa}. On the other hand, in a higgsino LSP scenario binos and winos should satisfy the LUX bounds described above.} In this scenario, the only observable SUSY particle could be a non-thermally produced higgsino which could be as light as $300$ GeV. The collider phenomenology of this scenario would be dominated by hard jet production with large missing energy, i.e. a monojet signal and soft leptons. This signal is produced by a pair of electroweakinos through exchange of $\gamma$, $W^\pm$ or $Z$ gauge bosons in the s-channel together with hard QCD initial state radiation.

Moreover, due to the degeneracy of the charginos $\chi_1^\pm$ with the neutralinos $\chi_1^0$ and $\chi_2^0$, they would probably have a lifetime $\tau\geq0.1$ ns, which is of the order of the collider scale \cite{Low:2014cba}. That makes these charginos long-lived particles which could generate a disappearing track signal.

Ref. \cite{Baer:2014kya} has shown that using monojet and soft leptons, the 3$\sigma$ exclusion limit for the higgsino mass is $250$ GeV with $1000$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity at $14$ TeV LHC. Given that this bound is less restrictive than the one imposed by Fermi-LAT dSph, the LHC seems to be less interesting for constraining this scenario. Ref. \cite{Low:2014cba} claimed that for a $100$ TeV machine the exclusion could reach higgsinos of $870$ GeV. Moreover, using disappearing tracks in a $100$ TeV collider, it could be possible to exclude higgsinos up to $750$ GeV but also to discover them for masses of almost $600$ GeV. A similar result was found in \cite{Ismail:2016zby} where there is a more systematic study of the uncertainties for a $100$ TeV collider. As can be seen from Fig. \ref{figInd}, this would imply that, unlike the case of thermally produced higgsinos, a future $100$ TeV collider could be able to test completely the scenario of non-thermally produced higgsino LSP. This makes this scenario a very interesting one to be tested in future colliders.



\section{Non-thermal cosmology from string scenarios}
\label{sec:DirectDetection}

As mentioned in Sec. \ref{section1}, the existence of moduli is a generic feature of string theory. These fields parametrise the shape and the size of the extra-dimensions and, at the level of 4D physics, they would mediate fifth forces whose range is inversely proportional to their mass. Given that these new interactions have not been observed, the moduli need to acquire a mass via the process of moduli stabilisation. The mechanism responsible to make the moduli massive fixes also all the main energy scales of a string compactification like the string scale, the Kaluza-Klein scale, the inflationary scale and the SUSY-breaking scale. The presence of such scalar fields has also a very important impact on cosmology since they can both drive inflaton in the very early universe, and affect the post-inflationary evolution of our universe \cite{NTDM,Allahverdi:2013noa,Allahverdi:2014ppa,Aparicio:2015sda,Cicoli:2015bpq}.

In this section we will perform a model dependent analysis of non-thermal higgsino DM production for the two best developed scenarios of moduli stabilisation in type IIB string theory: the Large Volume Scenario \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx} and the KKLT setup \cite{Kachru:2003aw}. In order to be explicit and set further constraints besides the ones discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:IndirectDetection}, we will consider three different classes of models: LVS with sequestered and non-sequestered SUSY-breaking and KKLT with nilpotent goldstino (see \cite{Aparicio:2015psl} for a detailed discussion of the hierarchy of energy scales for each case).


\subsection{Sequestered LVS models}

A well-studied scenario in type IIB is LVS with the visible sector localised on D3-branes at singularities \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk,Aparicio:2015psl,Aparicio:2014wxa}. In this model it is possible to achieve a hierarchy between the soft terms and the gravitino mass which is called \textit{sequestering}. The hierarchies are given by:
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}\sim \epsilon\ m_\phi \sim \epsilon^2\ m_{3/2} \sim \epsilon^3 M_s \sim \epsilon^4\ M_p\,,
\label{hierc1}
\end{equation}
where $M_{1/2}$ is the gaugino mass, $m_\phi$ is the mass of the lightest modulus, $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass and $M_s$ is the string scale. The hierarchy parameter $\epsilon\ll 1$ can be expressed in terms of the volume of the extra-dimensions ${V}$: $\epsilon\sim 1/\sqrt{{V}}$.\footnote{The volume is measured in units of the string length $\ell_s = M_s^{-1}$.} This framework can allow for two different scenarios depending on whether the soft scalar masses $m_0$ are of the order of the gaugino mass, i.e. $m_0 \simeq M_{1/2}$, or heavier, i.e. $M_{1/2}\simeq \epsilon\ m_0$. The second case corresponds to a split-SUSY like scenario. From \eqref{hierc1} and $T_{\rm r}\simeq \sqrt{m_\phi^3/M_p}$ we find the following relation between $T_{\rm r}$ and gaugino masses:
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}\simeq \epsilon \left(T_{\rm r}^2 M_p\right)^{1/3}\,.
\label{DirectRel}
\end{equation}

Let us now consider sequestered LVS models with non-thermal higgsino DM production described in Sec. \ref{sec:IndirectDetection}. For a given value of $\epsilon$ (or equivalently for a fixed value of ${V}$), (\ref{DirectRel}) gives $T_{\rm r}$ in terms of $M_{1/2}$. Substituting this relation in \eqref{NTann} we find that the non-thermal DM relic density depends on the ratio between higgsino and gaugino masses. The hierarchy $M_{1/2}-\mu$ is interesting because it allows us to introduce DM direct detection bounds. 

We consider a particularly interesting value of the extra-dimensional volume, ${V} \simeq 10^7$, because it yields both a string scale which is high enough to allow for GUT theories and viable inflationary model building, $M_s \sim M_{\rm GUT} \sim 10^{16}$ GeV, and low-energy gaugino masses around ${O}(1-10)$ TeV. Using \texttt{micrOMEGAs} we have computed the spin independent (SI) cross section and compared it with prospects from XENON1T \cite{Aprile:2011zza} and LZ \cite{Malling:2011va} (the bounds from LUX are irrelevant in this scenario). The relation \eqref{DirectRel} allows us to project all this information in the $(T_{\rm r}, m_\chi)$-plane which is the same parameter space used in Fig. \ref{figInd}.

In Fig. \ref{Fig2} we show the impact of direct detection bounds on the underlying parameter space for the case with $\mu > 0$. We see that the sensitivity to direct detection is generically small. Large scale DM direct detectors (beyond $1$ Ton) are necessary to cover the region with reheating temperatures close to $10$ GeV. In Fig. \ref{Fig3} we show a comparison between direct and indirect detection sensitivity. One can see that Fermi-LAT is already restricting more than what XENON1T can do. In order to constrain the parameter space more than what DM indirect detection is already doing, it is therefore necessary to consider experiments like LZ. Finally, for $T_{\rm r}>20$ GeV, which corresponds to moduli masses around $m_\phi\gtrsim {O}(10^4)$ TeV, the neutrino background covers the entire remaining parameter space.

In Fig. \ref{Fig4} we show the same analysis for the case with $\mu<0$. Note that the sensitivity to DM direct detection bounds is much lower than for the positive $\mu$ case. The reason can be understood from the effective $h\chi\chi$ coupling which appears in the nucleon-neutralino interaction:
\begin{equation}
c_{h\chi\chi}\sim \frac{1+\textrm{sign}(\mu)\sin2\beta}{M_1-\textrm{sign}(\mu)\mu}\,,
\end{equation}
where for $\mu<0$ the SI cross section tends to be smaller. Unlike the scenario with $\mu>0$, even large scale detectors like LZ will induce constraints below the Fermi-LAT dSph bounds.

The neutrino background seems to be larger than the signal for most regions of the parameter space. This means that DM direct detection experiments will hardly be able to probe this region. In \cite{Dent:2016iht} the authors have investigated the recoil spectra from different DM-nucleon effective field theory operators and they have compared them to the nuclear recoil energy spectra that are predicted to be induced by astrophysical neutrino sources. The dominant MSSM SI neutralino-nucleon operators ($\bar{q}q\bar{\chi}\chi$) can be distinguished from the neutrino backgrounds for a very large exposure, $10^3$ tonne years, since the recoil spectra for the signal is similar to the background. 

From Figs. \ref{Fig2} - \ref{Fig4} we can extract another interesting information about the sparticle spectrum. Given that in the sequestered LVS scenario $M_{1/2}$ is universal at the GUT scale, binos, winos and gluinos have different masses. If the DM relic density is saturated by higgsinos with $m_\chi\simeq 300$ GeV, we have $m_{\tilde{B}}\simeq 1.9$ TeV, $m_{\tilde{W}}\simeq 3.8$ TeV and $m_{\tilde{g}}\simeq 10.2$ TeV. Another interesting situation would be the case with $m_\chi\simeq 600$ GeV since it is in the region close to the LZ detection reach. In this case the spectrum of gauginos would be $m_{\tilde{B}}\simeq 6$ TeV, $m_{\tilde{W}}\simeq 12.3$ TeV and $m_{\tilde{g}}\simeq 33.3$ TeV. In both cases sfermion masses are at least on the multi-TeV range (typically ${O}(10)$ TeV) or heavier (their detailed spectrum depends on whether the SUSY model is split-like or not).

Finally, it is worth commenting that it is not clear whether the GUT boundary conditions of the sequestered LVS scenario allow for a light higgsino LSP. For example, a split-SUSY case with universal scalar masses (see \cite{Aparicio:2015psl}) would not allow light higgsinos. In this scenario the higgsino would actually be so heavy to induce a large loop correction to both the wino and bino masses, making them heavy as well. The result is a gluino LSP scenario which is already ruled out. In the case where $m_0\sim M_{1/2}$, the determination of the GUT boundary conditions which allow for light higgsinos is still an open question. It seems to be a set of very special conditions which allow for a focus-point behaviour (see for instance \cite{Aparicio:2015sda}). Hence the LVS sequestered scenario requires further studies to check if it has enough freedom to realise the higgsino LSP case studied in Sec. \ref{sec:IndirectDetection}.



\subsection{Non-sequestered LVS models}
\label{sec:NonSequestered}

An alternative option for the realisation of the visible sector is to localise SM gauge interactions on stacks of D7-branes wrapping some sub-manifolds of the compact space. In this case the gauge degrees of freedom are directly coupled to the sources of SUSY-breaking, and so all soft terms are of the same order of the gravitino mass but heavier than the lightest modulus $\phi$ \cite{Aparicio:2015psl}: 
\begin{equation}
m_\phi \sim \epsilon \left ( M_{1/2}\sim M_0 \sim m_{3/2} \right)  \sim \epsilon^2 M_s \sim  \epsilon^3 M_p\,.
\label{hierc2}
\end{equation}
In order to avoid the cosmological moduli problem we require $T_{\rm r}\geq 4$ MeV \cite{Hannestad:2004px}, and hence the modulus mass becomes $m_\phi\geq 34$ TeV. In turn, \eqref{hierc2} implies that all soft terms are very heavy, $M_{1/2}\gg 1 $ TeV. In particular, such heavy gauginos induce a large one-loop contribution to the higgsino mass \cite{Hall:2011jd}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta m_{\chi} = -\frac{\sin(2\beta)}{32 \pi^2}\left[ 3g_2^2 M_2 \log\left(\frac{M_H}{M_2}\right) + g_1^2 M_1 \log\left(\frac{M_H}{M_1}\right) \right]\,,
\label{loop}
\end{equation}
where $M_H$ is the mass of the heavy Higgs in SUSY models. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{d7.pdf}
\caption{One-loop contribution to higgsino mass induced by heavy gauginos as a function of the reheating temperature $T_{\rm r}$ due to the modulus decay.}
\label{Fig5}
\end{figure}

If this one-loop induced mass is very large, it could make the higgsino dangerously heavy. Fig. \ref{Fig5} shows this contribution in terms of $T_{\rm r}$. We have performed this computation using the hierarchies in \eqref{hierc2} and expressing them in terms of the reheating temperature (assuming again that ${V}\sim 10^7$). The contribution of $\tan\beta$ to \eqref{loop} has been calculated recursively in order to obtain a Higgs mass of $125$ GeV by using \texttt{SUSYHD} \cite{Vega:2015fna}. For temperatures above $4$ MeV, the one-loop induced higgsino mass becomes $\Delta m_\chi\geq1.4$ TeV. As can be seen from Fig. \ref{figInd}, this value of the higgsino mass leads to DM overproduction. Hence non-sequestered LVS models needs R-parity violation in order to avoid the overclosure of the universe. It would then be necessary to look for both alternative DM explanations and a mechanism to avoid fast proton decay in GUT theories.


\subsection{KKLT models with nilpotent goldstino}

Moduli stabilisation for KKLT models with a dS vacuum generated by anti D3-branes has been recently discussed in \cite{Aparicio:2015psl}. In this scenario the hierarchy between the gravitino and the lightest modulus mass is:
\begin{equation}
m_{3/2} \sim \epsilon^{4/3}\ m_{\phi} \sim \epsilon^2 M_p\,.
\label{hierc3}
\end{equation}
It is easy to see from \eqref{hierc3} that the gravitino is lighter than the modulus. Hence in KKLT models the last decaying particle which dominates the thermodynamic history of the universe is not a modulus but the gravitino. The gravitino is coupled to other particles only gravitationally, so DM production can be described using the same techniques illustrated in Sec. \ref{section2}. However, there is a difference with respect to the modulus case: gravitinos are not originated by a misalignment mechanism but rather by the inflaton decay. Hence this scenario is more model dependent because it depends on the scale of inflation. For instance, if inflation ends so late that the inflaton cannot kinematically decay into gravitinos, those will not be produced unless the last decaying modulus would be able to produce them.

The hierarchy between gravitino and scalar and gaugino masses is instead given by \cite{Aparicio:2015psl}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{kkltScal}
m	_0 &\sim & m_{3/2} \ \ \ \ \textrm{for visible sector on D7-branes,}\\
m_0 &\sim &\epsilon\ m_{3/2} \ \ \textrm{for visible sector on D3-branes,}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
M_a\simeq \left(\frac{\alpha_a b_a}{4\pi} + \epsilon^{4/3}\right) m_{3/2}\,,
\label{kkltGaug}
\end{equation}
where the first term in \eqref{kkltGaug} is the anomaly mediation contribution. A big difference with respect to the LVS scenario is that in KKLT the anomaly mediation contribution to gaugino masses dominates over the moduli mediation one. From \eqref{kkltScal} - \eqref{kkltGaug} it can be seen that there are two KKLT scenarios: typical anomaly mediation mini split-SUSY models when the visible sector is on D7-branes, and SUSY models with anomaly mediated gauginos which are a bit lighter than sfermions for the visible sector on D3-branes. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{kklt_N4.pdf}
\caption{Gravitino mass and DM relic density in terms of higgsino mass. The different coloured regions indicate bounds from indirect detection experiments. The red and orange ones correspond to the actual Fermi-LAT pass 8 bounds. The green line corresponds to CTA prospects. The diagonal dashed green line refers to $T_{3/2} = T_{\rm r} = m_\chi/20$.}
\label{FigKKLT}
\end{figure}


Like in the LVS case, in order to preserve BBN results we impose $T_{3/2} > 4$ MeV which implies $m_{3/2} \geq 10^5$ GeV \cite{Nakamura:2006uc}. From \eqref{kkltScal} - \eqref{kkltGaug} we can immediately see that this lower limit on the gravitino mass pushes scalars and gauginos to heavy scales. This has important consequences on the higgsino LSP scenario. In particular, similarly to the non-sequestered LVS case, heavy gauginos induce large one-loop contributions to the higgsino mass which tend to push higgsinos to heavy scales where their abundance would overclose the universe. 

However, if there is a leading order cancellation between the two contributions to gaugino masses in \eqref{kkltGaug}, the hierarchy between gauginos and gravitinos could be larger. This could allow for a region where the higgsino is still a good DM candidate. After studying this situation, we have found that in KKLT models with the visible sector on D7-branes higgsino are always too heavy. 

On the other hand, if the visible sector lives on D3-branes, there is a region where higgsino DM is still possible. This is due to the combination of the small hierarchy between scalars and gravitinos from \eqref{kkltScal} and the large hierarchy between gauginos and gravitinos which can be arranged by tuning  the two different contributions in \eqref{kkltGaug}.\footnote{Technically this region can be obtained by setting the non-perturbative effect number $N=4$ and ${V}\simeq 10^3$. In KKLT the internal volume is bounded both from below in order to trust the effective field theory, ${V}\geq 10^3$, and from above  to avoid tachyonic sleptons from anomaly mediation, ${V}\leq 10^5$ \cite{Aparicio:2015psl}.}

The results of this analysis are presented in Fig. \ref{FigKKLT} which shows that the one-loop contribution to the higgsino mass from heavy gauginos (see \eqref{loop}) sets an upper bound on the gravitino mass, $m_{3/2}\lesssim 6\times 10^7$, (the lower bound comes from BBN) beyond which there is DM overproduction. The dashed black lines show the total higgsino mass compared with the tree level one (corresponding to $\mu$) plotted on the x-axis. It is interesting to notice that even for $\mu = 0$ there could be a thermal higgsino LSP of $1.1$ TeV generated completely at loop level for $m_{3/2} \simeq 6\times 10^4$ TeV. This would be reproduce a spread SUSY scenario with higgsino LSP \cite{Hall:2011jd}. Note also that spread SUSY cannot be realised for the non-thermal case since it requires $\mu \neq 0$.

Moreover, Fig. \ref{FigKKLT} illustrates very clearly the effect of a late decaying gravitino on the DM abundance. The green dashed line corresponds to $T_{3/2} = T_{\rm f} \simeq m_\chi^{\rm tot}/20$ and separates the region where the gravitino does not affect DM production since it decays before the thermal freeze-out of the higgsino LSP, from the region with $T_{3/2} < T_{\rm f}$ where the gravitino decay has the same effects as those described in Sec. \ref{sec:IndirectDetection} for the modulus decay. Therefore the results shown in Fig. \ref{FigKKLT} are the same as those of Fig. \ref{figInd} with the only difference being that they are plotted in terms of $m_{3/2}$ instead of $T_{\rm r}$. 

Finally Fig. \ref{FigKKLT} indicates that non-thermally produced higgsinos with $m_\chi \simeq 300$ GeV require a gravitino mass of order $m_{3/2}\simeq 4\times 10^3$ TeV. This, in turn, gives scalars around $m_0\simeq 100$ TeV and gaugino masses of order $m_{\tilde{B}}\simeq 11$ TeV, $m_{\tilde{W}}\simeq 22$ TeV and $m_{\tilde{g}}\simeq 60$ TeV. This implies that higgsinos of $300$ GeV are in a region where the higgsino-nucleon SI cross section is almost below the neutrino background for $\mu>0$ and completely inside the neutrino background for $\mu<0$. Therefore it seems that DM direct detection is much less useful in the KKLT scenario than in the LVS one. 


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this work we focused on supersymmetric models where the LSP is a higgsino-like neutralino which plays the role of DM in the context of a non-standard cosmology. The difference with respect to the standard cosmological history comes from the presence of new degrees of freedom which can decay late changing the DM relic abundance produced by the standard thermal freeze-out scenario. The presence of such fields is well motivated from string theory where moduli fields naturally emerge in its low-energy 4D limit. 

The paper is divided into two parts. In Sec. \ref{section1}, \ref{section2} and \ref{sec:IndirectDetection} we performed a model independent analysis of supersymmetric models with non-thermal production of light higgsino DM. In Sec. \ref{sec:DirectDetection} we presented instead a model dependent discussion of different string models where a non-standard cosmology is motivated by the presence of moduli which decay at late time. For each string model we studied theoretical and observational constraints on higgsino  non-thermal DM production.

The main conclusions of the model independent analysis developed in the first part of the paper are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In non-thermal cosmologies with an extra period of matter domination which ends via reheating with temperatures of ${O}(1 - 10)$ GeV (above BBN), light higgsinos with masses as low as a few hundred GeV can correctly saturate the DM content measured by the Planck satellite. 

\item Such light higgsinos are very interesting from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view. The fact that they are very light makes them easily accessible to both indirect detection and collider searches.

\item The strongest bound from indirect detection imposes that non-thermally produced higgsinos cannot be lighter than $300$ GeV. This bound comes from Fermi-LAT dSph where the dependence on the DM astrophysical profile is less important than in galactic centre observations. Observations by future experiments like CTA, together with data from Fermi-LAT GC, could cover essentially the entire parameter space of this scenario. On the other hand, unlike in the thermal case, collider signals from a $100$ TeV machine could test directly this scenario using searches on monojet and disappearing tracks.
\end{enumerate}

From the model dependent discussion performed in the second part of the paper, we can conclude that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The main difference between LVS and KKLT scenarios for type IIB moduli stabilisation is that the last particle to decay in LVS models is the lightest modulus, while in KKLT models it is the gravitino. However, both cases feature a late decaying particle (scalar in LVS and fermion in KKLT) which motivates the analysis performed in the first part of the paper. Depending on the scenario under consideration, the hierarchy between the masses of the moduli, the higgsinos and the other superpartners can take a different form. 

\item When the visible sector is localised on D7-branes, both LVS and KKLT models with stable higgsino LSP are plagued by the problem of DM overproduction since heavy gaugino masses give rise a large contribution to higgsino masses at one-loop level.

\item KKLT models with the visible sector on D3-branes still tend to have problems with higgsino DM overproduction due to the fact that gauginos are heavy in order to have gravitinos which decay before BBN. However, there is a fine-tuned region of the underlying parameter space where the non-thermal production of light higgsinos can yield the correct DM abundance. 

\item LVS models with the visible sector on D3-branes seem to be the best option to realise non-thermal scenarios with light higgsino DM. In fact, one-loop corrections to higgsino masses are small since sequestering effects suppress gaugino masses with respect to the mass of the decaying modulus. By exploiting the relation between the modulus and the gaugino mass, we managed to rewrite the reheating temperature in terms of the gaugino mass. This allowed us to introduce the effect of DM direct detection searches. We have found that, on the one hand, it is necessary to use large scale DM direct detection experiments (beyond $1$ Ton) to constrain more than what indirect detection already does, while, on the other hand, a large region of the parameter space falls below the neutrino background, and so DM direct detection experiments do not seem to be very useful to explore the parameter space of these theories.
\end{enumerate}

Future experiments will be able to completely probe the underlying parameter space of supersymmetric models with non-thermal light higgsino DM. This makes this scenario very interesting from both DM detection and future collider searches at $100$ TeV and motivates a detailed analysis from both sides.

\section{Introduction}

The recent direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs)~\cite{Abbott:2016blz} has opened a new window of observation for physical phenomena in which gravity is the dominant interaction. Collisions of black holes~\cite{Abbott:2016nmj, Abbott:2017vtc, Abbott:2017gyy, Abbott:2017oio} and neutron stars~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa} have been observed and a plethora of new events, even involving new physics, are expected to be detected in the next few years. Furthermore, the on-going search for new compact objects such as exo-planets will provide vast amount of new data over the upcoming decades (e.g.~from GAIA~\cite{gaia}). It is natural to explore alternative physical objects that may exist which are different from the standard stars and black holes and that could lead to particular imprints on the GW spectrum. Boson stars, Bose-Einstein condensates of gravitationally coupled scalar fields, are well motivated alternatives that have been discussed for several decades. A relatively vast literature already exists  on different realisations of boson stars (for reviews see~\cite{Jetzer:1991jr,Liddle:1993ha,Schunck:2003kk,1202.5809}). Similar arguments hold for fermion stars formed from fermions in beyond the standard model physics~\cite{Narain:2006kx}.

String theory, being a fundamental theory of gravity, has the potential to make physical predictions that can be tested only through gravitational couplings. The (complex) closed string moduli superfields of string theory provide a generic sector that couples only gravitationally. The corresponding real scalar particles tend to survive at low energies with masses of the order of the gravitino mass and below (e.g.~\cite{deCarlos:1993wie, GomezReino:2006dk}), phenomenologically required to be larger than $	\mathcal{O} (30 \, \text{TeV})$~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, Banks:1993en, deCarlos:1993wie}\footnote{We comment in due course on how the relaxation of this constraint affects the spectrum of exotic compact objects.}. The axion components can have a much larger range of masses, in particular they can be lighter and can lead to a realisation of ultra-light axions. Furthermore fermionic partners of the moduli fields tend to have masses of order the gravitino mass and may in principle contribute to fermion stars. Open string modes may also provide candidates for boson and fermion stars.

A typical string compactification has hundreds or thousands of complex moduli fields that have different properties and each of them may lead to completely different physics (e.g.~dilaton, complex structure moduli, K\"ahler moduli which in turn can be blow-up modes, fibre moduli, etc.). In this work we explore the possibility that moduli can compose compact objects and in particular we focus on star-like solutions from string moduli which can be called \textit{moduli stars}. We briefly comment on the possibility for their fermionic partners, the `modulini' as well as the gravitino can give rise to a new class of fermion stars.

The effective field theory emerging for string moduli often leads to non-generic couplings from a standard QFT point of view and may point at regions in theory space which might be neglected otherwise. One scope of this article is to explore which exotic compact objects can be achieved from string effective field theory. In this sense, the potential discovery of other types of compact objects (e.g.~relying on EFTs not attainable in string theory) would challenge current scenarios of string compactifications, similar in spirit to the swampland discussion in the context of large field inflation~\cite{Vafa:2005ui}.

Stars composed of bosonic particles have been studied using a hypothetically long-lived complex or real scalar field~\cite{Kaup:1968zz, Ruffini:1969qy}. In this case the stability is not due to the Pauli exclusion principle as in fermion stars, but due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that constrains momenta to be bound by the inverse radius of the star. In each case the structure of the boson star (i.e.~radius and mass) varies substantially depending on the self couplings of the boson fields. For a free massive complex scalar field $\Phi$, the maximum mass of the boson star is $M_{\rm max}\simeq\left(10^{-10}\,{\rm eV}/m_{\rm boson}\right) \, M_{\odot}$ and these objects are called \textit{mini-boson stars}. This value of the mass can be enhanced if the scalar field has attractive interactions of the form $V_{\rm interaction} = - \frac{g}{4!} \left|\Phi\right|^4$ that dominates over the mass term, i.e.~if $\frac{\left|V_{\rm interaction}\right|}{m^2 \left|\Phi\right|^2} \gg 1$. In this case the maximum mass can be enhanced to $M_{\rm max} \simeq \left(\frac{10 \, \text{MeV}}{m_{\rm boson}}\right)^2 \, \sqrt{g} \, M_{\odot}$~\cite{Colpi:1986ye}.
 
Additional stability to compact objects can be achieved if an additional symmetry (e.g.~a global U$(1)$ symmetry) protects the bosonic condensate. The corresponding Noether charge is conserved and prevents the condensate to decay. Non-topological solitons such as Q-balls are the prime examples\,\cite{Coleman:1985ki}, that are already stable before turning gravity on. Furthermore the global U$(1)$ symmetry allows for a time dependence of $\Phi$, $\Phi(x,t)=\varphi(x) e^{i\omega t}$ while keeping a static spacetime metric (a constant time translation is compensated by a U$(1)$ transformation). For real scalars there is no conserved charge and stability is not automatic. 

In order to give rise to a long-lived compact objects, the corresponding particle has to be quasi-stable and could contribute to dark matter. String theory offers many dark matter candidates and quasi-stable particles, to name a few: matter fields from a hidden sector, moduli (including the dilaton and the many axions), the gravitino (see for instance~\cite{Halverson:2018xge}). But even if the particle decays relatively early in the history of the Universe it may still give rise to (relatively) long-lived compact objects that contribute to the energy density of the Universe for some time and may leave observational signatures such as GWs. We explore here this wide arena by giving explicit examples of axion stars, moduli stars and by discussing the realisation of Q-balls end extensions thereof in string theory.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:bosonstarsinfieldtheory} we review the basics of stars and Q-balls. Section~\ref{sec:StringCOs} is devoted to the string theory realisation of such objects and their phenomenology, including possible GW signatures. In Section~\ref{sec:formationall} we discuss the possible formation of compact objects, describing a possible new solution to the moduli field equations that could lead to the formation of compact objects (\ref{sec:SpinningAxion}), and discussing the possible formation of compact objects during an early matter era, which is generic in string models (\ref{sec:EarlyMatterEra}). We present our conclusions and outlook in Section~\ref{sec:Conclusions}.\\

Concerning the notation, we always use the $(-,+,+,+)$ convention for the metric signature. The Planck mass $m_{\rm p}$ is defined in terms of the Newton constant $G$
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm p} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-5} \,g \,,
\end{equation}
and we will always take $\hbar = c = 1$. The reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$ is defined through the relation
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm p}^2 = 8 \pi M_{\rm P}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
The Planck length is
\begin{equation}
\ell_{\rm p} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-33} \,\text{cm} \,.
\end{equation}
The solar mass is
\begin{equation}
M_{\odot} \simeq 2 \times 10^{33} \, \text{g} \simeq 10^{57} \, \text{GeV} \,.
\end{equation}

We also report the value of one parsec
\begin{equation}
1 \, \text{pc} = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} \,,
\end{equation}
and some conversion rules
\begin{equation}
1 \, \text{GeV} \simeq 1.8 \times 10^{-24}  \, \text{g} \simeq 5 \times 10^{13} \, \text{cm}^{-1} \simeq 1.5 \times 10^{24} \, \text{Hz} \,.
\end{equation}
 
\section{Compact Objects in Field Theory}
\label{sec:bosonstarsinfieldtheory}

In this section we briefly review different types of compact objects which have been discussed in field theory and we classify them according to the mechanism that makes them stable against small perturbations. The first obvious example that we review is that of \textit{fermion stars} in which gravitational attraction is compensated by the fermion pressure coming from Pauli's principle, as in neutron stars. We then start the discussion of bosonic compact objects from non-topological solitons called \textit{Q-balls}~\cite{Coleman:1985ki, Lee:1991ax}, that exist for a complex scalar field with a global\footnote{See~\cite{Rosen, Lee:1988ag, Kusenko:1997vi} for gauged Q-balls.} U$(1)$ symmetry. The real countepart of Q-balls corresponds to pseudo-solitonic objects called \textit{oscillons}~\cite{Gleiser:1993pt} that we already studied in the string theory context in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}. In both Q-balls and oscillons the repulsive gradient pressure is balanced by an attractive self-interaction. Moreover, the global U$(1)$ symmetry makes Q-balls composed of $\Phi$ particles absolutely stable, i.e.~they cannot decay into free $\Phi$ particles (although they can decay via couplings to other fields, see e.g.~\cite{Cohen:1986ct}). The absence of an analogous symmetry that stabilizes the localized configuration (see however~\cite{Mukaida:2016hwd}) makes oscillons long-lived but eventually they have to classically decay~\cite{Segur:1987mg, Fodor:2009kf}, radiating scalar waves to infinity\footnote{See~\cite{Hertzberg:2010yz} for an analysis of quantum effects.}. Q-balls and oscillons have a rich phenomenology in terms of GW production~\cite{Zhou:2013tsa, Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz, Amin:2018xfe}, baryogenesis~\cite{Riotto:1999yt, Dine:2003ax, Buchmuller:2005eh, Lozanov:2014zfa}, dark matter~\cite{Kusenko:1997si, Burgess:2000yq}. While Q-balls and oscillons can exist in the regime in which gravity is negligible, for other classes of compact objects gravity is the force that stabilizes the repulsive gradient pressure, while self-interactions can be absent. This is the case of \textit{boson stars}~\cite{Kaup:1968zz, Ruffini:1969qy}, arising from a single complex scalar field, and of \textit{oscillatons}~\cite{Seidel:1991zh}, in the case of a real scalar field. To make a comparison with fermion stars the balance between gravity and gradients pressure in these objects can be thought as a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Analogously to Q-balls, boson stars can be absolutely stable in the presence of a global U$(1)$ symmetry, while oscillatons can be long-lived but they eventually have to decay like oscillons. One particularly interesting example of oscillatons is represented by axions stars~\cite{Kolb:1993zz, Kolb:1993hw}, that can arise in different contexts. Occasionally we will collectively refer to all the star-like solutions described here as ‘boson stars’, contrary to what is usually done in the literature, where the name boson stars refers specifically to the complex scalar field case.

Finally, axion-like particles provide an additional type of compact object, which is unrelated to the star-like or solitonic solutions mentioned so far. If the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) U$(1)$ symmetry is broken after inflation (i.e.~if the axion decay constant $f < H_{\rm inf}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation), the symmetry breaking mechanism generates large fluctuations in the axion field. In the case of the QCD axion ($m_{\rm QCD} \simeq 10^{-5} \, \rm eV$) it has been shown that these are so large that collapse before the start of matter domination (at $T \sim 0.75 \, \text{eV}$) giving rise to \textit{axion miniclusters}~\cite{Hogan:1988mp, Kolb:1993zz, Kolb:1993hw, Enander:2017ogx}. These objects would be much denser than the dark matter halos (even by a factor of $10^{10}$) but also quite rare, so that the probability of direct detection due to an encounter is very small. The typical size for QCD axion miniclusters is roughly $R_{\rm minicl.} \simeq 10^{13} \, \rm cm \sim 1 \, \rm UA$, while their typical mass would be $M_{\rm minicl.} \simeq 10^{-11} \, M_{\odot}$.

\subsection{Fermion Stars}
\label{sec:FermionStars}

Standard white dwarfs or neutron stars are understood in terms of a gas of fermions for which their degeneracy compensates for the gravitational attraction.
Following the argument of Landau for neutron stars~\cite{Narain:2006kx} for $N$ free fermions of mass $m_f$,  the total energy in a sphere of radius $R$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
E(R)=-\frac{GMm_f}{R} + \left(\frac{9\pi}{4}\right)^{1/3} \frac{N^{1/3}}{R}\,,
\end{equation}
where the first term describes the attractive gravitational potential and the second one is the (relativistic) kinetic energy of the fermion on the surface of the star. Here $M=Nm_f$ is the total mass of the star. We have used the relativistic limit in which the kinetic energy is roughly $k_f\gg m_f$ for a relativistic fermion of momentum $k_f.$ $k_f$ is determined by its relation to the number density in Fermi statistics: $N/(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3)=k_f^3/(3\pi^2)$. If the second term of the equation above dominates the star expands until the fermion density is so small that the kinetic energy term becomes of  order $m_f$ and the gravitational interaction stabilises it. 

A rough estimate of the maximum mass and minimum radius of the star can be made by noticing that both energies are of the same order ($E(R)=0$) for a maximum  value of $N=N_{\rm max}$ 
giving a total mass:
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm max}\sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^3}{m_f^2}~,
\end{equation}
which gives the standard Chandrasekhar limit. The corresponding minimum radius can be estimated  by taking $k_f\sim m_f$:
\begin{equation}
R_{\rm min}\sim \frac{M_{\rm P}}{m_f^2}.
\end{equation} 
For a neutron with mass $m_{\rm N}\sim 1$ GeV these expressions give the standard results of $M_{\rm max}\sim M_\odot$ and $R_{\rm min}\sim 2$ Km. 


\subsection{Boson Stars}
\label{sec:BosonStars}

Boson stars are solitonic-like solutions of the coupled Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. The simplest case corresponds to a massive complex scalar $\Phi$ of mass m. The action is of the type:
\begin{equation}
S=\int \sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{2} R-g^{\mu \nu}\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi - V(|\Phi|)\right) \,,
\label{eq:actionbs}
\end{equation}
with $V=m^2|\Phi|^2$.
A boson star would correspond to a spherically symmetric configuration with metric:

\begin{equation}
ds^2= -A(r)^2 dt^2 + B(r)^2 dr^2 + r^2 \left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right).
\label{eq:metricansatz}
\end{equation}
A static spherically symmetric configuration for the scalar field would not give solitonic solutions due to Derrick's theorem. However, a stationary spherically symmetric scalar field of the form
\begin{equation}
\Phi(r,t)=\Phi_{\rm R} (r)\, e^{i\omega t}
\end{equation}
allows for a solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations from eq.~\eqref{eq:actionbs} with a static metric as above (time translations in $\Phi$ are compensated by a global U$(1)$ transformation $\Phi\to e^{i\alpha}\Phi$).

Contrary to fermion stars the gravitational attraction is compensated by the Heisenberg principle to prevent collapse. Naively this implies that  $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \hbar $ with $\Delta x= R$ and $\Delta p=mc$ for a boson of mass $m$ then the minimal radius is
\begin{equation}
R_{\rm min}\sim \frac{1}{m}~.
\end{equation}
From this we can obtain the maximal mass by setting the radius to the Schwarzschild radius $R=R_S=2GM$
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm max}\sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m}~.
\end{equation}
Comparing with fermion stars, fermionic stars are much heavier and larger than boson stars for fermions and bosons of the same mass. For instance, for a boson with a mass of a neutron $m\sim 1$ GeV the corresponding star radius is of order $R_{\rm min}\sim 10^{-15}$~cm and mass $M_{\rm max}\sim 10^{36}\,\rm{GeV}\sim 10^{-21}\, M_\odot$. To highlight that these objects are typically much lighter than $M_{\odot}$, they are usually called \textit{mini-boson stars}~\cite{Kaup:1968zz, Ruffini:1969qy}. However, if interactions are relevant this naive estimate can be modified~\cite{Colpi:1986ye}. For instance for a scalar field with quartic couplings
\begin{equation}
V(|\Phi|)= \frac{1}{2} m^2 |\Phi|^2 - \frac{g}{4!} |\Phi|^4 \,,
\end{equation}
the mass of the star becomes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MassEnhancement}
M\sim \tilde{g}^{1/2} \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m}\sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^3}{m^2} \,,
\end{equation}
with $\tilde{g} = \frac{g M_{\rm P}^2}{m^2}$ the dimensionless quartic coupling. In this case the boson star mass takes the same form as the Chandrasekhar limit for fermion stars if $g\sim 1$, therefore allowing for macroscopic stars for scalar masses in the GeV range. 
 
\subsection{Oscillatons}
\label{sec:Oscillatons}
 
The pattern of bosonic compact objects may be substantially expanded by considering real scalar fields that we denote by $\varphi$~\cite{Seidel:1991zh}. As it is not possible to find a background field ansatz that makes the metric time-independent~\cite{UrenaLopez:2001tw, UrenaLopez:2002gx, UrenaLopez:2012zz}, the $t$-$t$ and $r$-$r$ components of the metric in eq.~\eqref{eq:metricansatz} become time-dependent. An equilibrium configuration of the star can be found by expanding the background field $\varphi(r,t)$ as well as the metric functions $A(r,t)$ and $B(r,t)$ in Fourier series. The corresponding solutions, called \textit{oscillatons}, have been found numerically and studied in different contexts~\cite{UrenaLopez:2001tw, UrenaLopez:2002gx, Alcubierre:2003sx, Guzman:2004wj}. The solutions depend crucially on the amplitude of the background field oscillations $\varphi_{\rm core} \equiv \text{max}\{\varphi(0,t)\}$. In this section we briefly describe the known results already contained in the literature and how they need to be modified to be extended to the case of string potentials.\\

We denote by $\Lambda$ the typical field range of the canonically normalized field in the potential under study. As an example, for an axion potential the scale $\Lambda$ would typically be $ \Lambda = 2 \pi f$, where $f$ is the axion decay constant. Along with the mass of the particle, the scale $\Lambda$ plays a crucial role as it determines the maximum energy that can be stored in a scalar field $\rho_{\rm max} \sim m^2 \Lambda^2$. As we will see more in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:ModuliStars}, the scale $\Lambda$ sets the natural scale for the mass of a star composed by mass $m$ scalar particles
\begin{equation}
M/\tilde{M} \simeq \Lambda^2/m \,,
\end{equation}
where the dimensionless parameter $\tilde{M}$ has to be computed numerically and can span a few orders of magnitude. At the same time, the natural scale for the radius of the star is set by the scalar mass $m$
\begin{equation}
R/\tilde{R} \simeq 1/m \,,
\end{equation}
where again the dimensionless parameter $\tilde{R}$ has to be computed numerically and can span a few orders of magnitude. 
The density of the star is encoded in the compactness parameter
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CompactnessDef}
C = \frac{M}{R} = \frac{\tilde{M}}{\tilde{R}} \Lambda^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{C} \equiv \tilde{M}/\tilde{R}$ is the dimensionless compactness\footnote{For instance the compactness of a black hole with Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S} = 2 G M$ is $C_{\rm BH} = 4 \pi$. Notice that in $m_{\rm p}$ units it would be $C_{\rm BH} = \frac{1}{2}$~\cite{Giudice:2016zpa}.}. It follows that the overall densest objects are typically those with $\Lambda = M_{\rm P}$: for a fixed value of $\tilde{C}$ the compactness is suppressed by a factor of $\left(\Lambda/M_{\rm P}\right)^2$. Given a fixed value of the scale $\Lambda$, stars with larger core amplitude are denser, as we will show explicitly in Sec.~\ref{sec:ModuliStars}. We then distinguish two regimes depending on the ratio between the $\varphi_{\rm core}$ and $\Lambda$~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx, Visinelli:2017ooc}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} {\it Dilute regime:} $\varphi_{\rm core} \ll \Lambda$.\\
In this regime self-interactions of the form $\left(\lambda_n/n!\right) \varphi^n$ (with $n \geq 3$) of the field are negligible. The system can be studied in the weak gravity approximation, in which case the metric components can be assumed to be static and can be expanded as $A^2(r) \sim 1+2\,\phi(r)$ and $B^{2}(r) \sim 1-2\,\phi(r)$ where $\phi(r)$ is the Newtonian potential~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx, Visinelli:2017ooc}. The equations of motion are then the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive real scalar field in the weak gravity regime coupled to the Poisson equation for $\phi(r)$. Equivalently, taking the field theory approach in the non-relativistic approximation the system reduces to a Schr\"odinger equation coupled to the Poisson equation~\cite{Guzman:2004wj, Guth:2014hsa}. In this limit the system of equations features a scale symmetry that makes the analysis particularly simple, see Sec.~\ref{sec:ModuliStars}.
 
\item{}{\it Dense regime:} $\varphi_{\rm core} \sim \Lambda$.\\
In this regime the self-interaction terms - if present - are important. The dense regime of the free massive case is fairly well understood: if $\Lambda = M_{\rm P}$ it features both a stable and an unstable branch~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx}. The oscillaton mass depends on the core amplitude and the maximum mass of a stable oscillaton in the free massive field case is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MaxOscillatonMass}
M_{\rm max} \simeq 0.607 \, \frac{m_p^2}{m} \simeq 15.26 \, \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m} \,,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the real scalar field. This maximum value of the star mass corresponds to a core amplitude $\varphi_{\rm core}^{\rm max}/M_{\rm P} \sim 0.48$. Oscillatons with core amplitude smaller than $\varphi_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$ belong to the stable branch while those with larger core amplitude belong to the unstable branch. Oscillaton configurations perturbed around the unstable branch can either collapse to black holes or radiate energy and migrate back to the stable branch, depending on the perturbation. If self-interaction terms are present and $\Lambda = M_{\rm P}$ the numerics become extremely more involved and the study of a generic interacting potential is currently missing. Equilibrium configurations in the case of a repulsive quartic interaction has been studied in~\cite{ValdezAlvarado:2011dd, UrenaLopez:2012zz} for moderately large values of the dimensionsless coupling $\tilde{g} = \frac{g M_{\rm P}^2}{m^2}$ in the range $\tilde{g} \sim 1\text{-}4$. In this case the expected maximum oscillaton mass is enhanced but to numerically check the behaviour in eq.~\eqref{eq:MaxEnhancement} it would be necessary to probe the region of parameter space $\tilde{g} \gg 1$. Finally, dense solutions with $\Lambda \ll M_{\rm P}$ correspond to the regime in which gravity is negligible. In this case compact objects corresponding to oscillons can be formed in the presence of attractive self-interactions. As an example, oscillons formed in blow-up potentials studied in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz} belong to this case. In particular we stress that it is self-consistent to neglect gravity in that case.
\end{enumerate}

Oscillatons include the important case in which the real scalar is an axion-like particle giving rise to axion stars (see~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc} and references therein for the state of the art). The Lagrangian is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}= - \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu\theta \partial_\mu\theta -\mu^4\left(1-\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{f}\right)\right)\,,
\label{eq:bound}
\end{equation} 
where $\mu$ is an energy scale generated by non-perturbative effects that break the original PQ shift-symmetry. If the leading interaction term is an attractive quartic term (e.g. $V_{\rm interaction} = - \left(g/4!\right) \varphi^4$) as for axion-like particles there is an additional regime for which $\frac{f}{8 \pi M_{\rm P}} \lesssim \frac{\varphi_0}{2 \pi f} \lesssim 1$, called the \textit{critical regime}~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc}. In the critical regime the amplitude of the background field is still small but large enough such that the leading order self-interaction is stronger than gravity and balance the kinetic pressure from the uncertainty principle. Configurations in the critical regime are unstable against small perturbations: they either disperse or collapse to denser objects~\cite{Chavanis:2016dab, Helfer:2016ljl, Levkov:2016rkk}. The critical regime exists only if the quartic order self-interaction is attractive: in the repulsive case there is a single branch with $\varphi_{\rm core}/\Lambda < 1$ that is always stable~\cite{Schiappacasse:2017ham}. The dense regime of axion stars has first been studied in the Thomas-Fermi approximation that resulted to be not well justified~\cite{Braaten:2015eeu}. Recently, the it has been properly studied in full GR~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl}: it turns out that axion stars have a different evolution depending on their mass and on the axion decay constant: they can be (meta-)stable, collapse to black holes or disperse. One particularly interesting application of axion stars appears for an ultralight axion-like particle (ULA) with mass $m_{\rm ULA} \sim 1\text{-}10 \times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$, which constitutes a good dark matter candidate called \textit{fuzzy dark matter}~\cite{Hu:2000ke} or \textit{ultralight dark matter} (ULDM). Interestingly, ULDM could address several issues arising in the cold dark matter case~\cite{Hui:2016ltb}, even though $m \lesssim 1\text{-}2 \times 10^{-21} \, \rm eV$ are in tension with observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest~\cite{Viel:2013apy}. In particular, numerical simulations show that in the presence of ULDM solitonic cores of $\mathcal{O}\left(\text{kpc}\right)$ size are formed in dark matter halos~\cite{Schive:2014dra, Veltmaat:2018dfz, Levkov:2018kau}, potentially addressing the cusp-core problem of cold dark matter~\cite{Marsh:2015wka}. Such cores could also give rise to specific signatures~\cite{Hui:2016ltb}.\\

Notice that, as for axion stars, in the case of string potentials (typically given by the sum of exponentials) the scale $\Lambda$ implies that for a core amplitude $\varphi_{\rm core} \sim \Lambda$ all the interaction terms have to be included in the analysis. We have already studied the dense regime for blow-up potentials ($\Lambda \ll M_{\rm P}$) in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}: in this paper we focus on the dilute regime for moduli potentials (both with $\Lambda \sim M_{\rm P}$ and with $\Lambda \ll M_{\rm P}$), and we will report the analysis of the dense regime for $\Lambda \sim M_{\rm P}$ moduli potentials (via a full GR simulation as in~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl}) in a forthcoming publication.

\subsection{Q-Balls}
\label{sec:QBalls}

Q-balls are particular cases of non-topological solitons which have been originally proposed in~\cite{Coleman:1985ki}. Let us consider a four-dimensional complex scalar field $\Phi$ with Lagrangian symmetric under a global U$(1)$:
 \begin{equation}
 \mathcal{S}= \int d^4 x \left(\frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \Phi \partial_\mu \Phi^* \, -\, V(|\Phi|)\right).
 \end{equation} 
 The U$(1)$ Noether current and charge are:
 \begin{equation}
 J_\mu = \frac{1}{2i}\left( \Phi^*\partial_\mu \Phi-\Phi\partial_\mu\Phi^*\right) \,, \qquad Q=\int d^3 x\, J^0=\frac{1}{2i}\int d^3 x\left(\Phi^*\dot{\Phi}-h.c.\right).
 \end{equation}
 Assuming that $\Phi=0$ at the minimum of the scalar potential, it provides a $Q=0$ vacuum state. Configurations with charge $Q\neq 0$ can be obtained by minimising the total energy subject to a constant $Q$ constraint. That is we need to extremise the quantity:
 \begin{equation}
 E_\omega=\int d^3 x \left(\frac{1}{2}|\dot{\Phi}|^2+\frac{1}{2}|\nabla\Phi|^2+ V(|\Phi|) \right)+\omega\left(Q-\frac{1}{2i}\int d^3 x\left(\Phi^*\dot{\Phi}-h.c.\right)\right),
 \end{equation}
  where $\omega$ denotes a Lagrange multiplier. This expression can be rewritten as 
  \begin{equation}
 E_\omega=\int d^3 x \left(\frac{1}{2}|\dot{\Phi}-i\omega \Phi |^2+\frac{1}{2}|\nabla\Phi|^2+ \hat{V}(|\Phi|) \right)+\omega Q \,,
  \end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_\omega(|\Phi|)=V(|\Phi|)-\frac{1}{2}\omega^2 |\Phi|^2.
\end{equation}
The kinetic term vanishes for :
\begin{equation}
\Phi(x,t)=\Phi_{\rm R}(x) e^{i\omega t} \,,
\end{equation}
which for real $\Phi_{\rm R}(x)$ provides a stationary configuration with time-independent but non-vanishing energy and charge. 

The task of extremising with respect to $\Phi_{\rm R}$ is the same as finding the tunneling solution for a 3-dimensional Euclidean action with potential $\hat{V}(\Phi_{\rm R})$. To simplify this task Coleman~\cite{Coleman:1985ki} assumed large $Q$ or the thin wall approximation such that the field $\Phi_{\rm R}$ has a value $\Phi_0$ (to be determined by minimising the energy) inside a region of volume $\text{Vol}$ and $\Phi_{\rm R}=0$ (the true vacuum) outside. In this approximation gradients are neglected and extremising $E_\omega $ with respect to $\omega$ gives $\omega_0 = Q/(\Phi_0^2 \, \text{Vol})$ and substituting into $E_\omega$ implies:
\begin{equation}
E_{\omega_0}=V(\Phi_0) \, \text{Vol}+\frac{Q^2}{2 \Phi_0^2 \, \text{Vol}} \,.
\end{equation}
Extremising now with respect to the volume $\text{Vol}$ leads to $\text{Vol}=Q/\sqrt{2 \Phi_0^2 V}$ and:
\begin{equation}
E=Q\sqrt{\frac{2 V(\Phi_0)}{\Phi_0^2}} \,.
\end{equation}
Therefore the value of $\Phi_0$ can be obtained by extremising the quantity: $V/\Phi_{\rm R}^2$. This coincides with the minimum of $\hat{V}$  (and therefore solves the equations of motion) for the value of $\omega=\omega_0=\sqrt{2 V/\Phi_0^2}$ as it can be easily verified. Notice that for this value of $\omega_0$ the value of $\hat{V}$ vanishes at the minimum $\Phi_{\rm R}=\Phi_0$ and so the new minimum is degenerate with the one at $\Phi_{\rm R}=0$ which remains a minimum of $\hat{V}$ as long as $\omega^2< \mu^2=V''(0)$. 

We then have that a charge $Q$ configuration with constant energy localised in a finite volume (the Q-ball) exists as long as there is a non zero minimum of the quantity $V/|\Phi|^2$. Since the energy per unit charge is less than the mass of a single charged particle ($\omega^2< m^2$), the Q-ball is stable against decay to a gas of individual particles.

Beyond the thin-wall approximation, a proper solution with non-vanishing gradient terms solving the field equation for $\Phi_{\rm R}$
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm R}'' +\frac{2}{r}\Phi_{\rm R}'+ \partial_\Phi V = 0
\end{equation}
can be found numerically but inferred by standard tunneling solution techniques working with the analogy of a particle in the inverted Euclidean potential. Several examples including the thick wall case have also been found in the literature~\cite{Kusenko:1997ad}.

\section{Compact Objects from Strings}
\label{sec:StringCOs}


Let us start with the fermion stars. In string compactifications there are several classes of low energy fermions of mass $m$ that could be dark matter candidates and then can be the basis for exotic compact objects of maximum mass beyond which they can collapse to a black hole $M\sim M_{\rm P}^3/m^2$ and minimum radius $R\sim M_{\rm P}/m^2$. From the model independent closed string sector, the gravitino has a mass $m_{3/2}=M_{\rm P} W_0/{V}$ which can be in the mass range from TeV to $10^{-2}\, M_{\rm P}$ and therefore a gravitino star of mass $M\sim {V}^2 M_{\rm P}/W_0^2$ and radius $R\sim {V}^2/(M_{\rm P}W_0^2)$.  Modulini, the fermionic partners of moduli fields, also have a mass $m\sim m_{3/2}$ leading to similar compact objects. In summary for TeV fermions coupled only gravitationally the corresponding stars would have maximum masses of order $M\sim 10^{48} \,\rm{GeV}\sim 10^{-9} \,M_\odot$ and radius $R\sim 10^{-3} \,\rm{cm}$.  In general for the Large Volume Scenario (LVS)~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx,Conlon:2005ki}, in the range $10^3\leq {V}\leq 10^9$ for which the effective field theory is valid and the cosmological moduli problem is not present, we may have fermion stars with maximal mass and minimum radii in the range
\begin{equation}
1 \,\text{g} \lesssim M\lesssim 10^{15} \, \text{g}\,, \qquad 10^{-27}\, \text{cm} \lesssim R \lesssim 10^{-15} \,\text{cm}~.
\end{equation}
We then may have objects of the size of an atomic nucleus and as heavy as Mount Everest. There may be a more diverse variety of candidates from open strings. First potential dark matter candidates from the visible sector corresponding to axinos and neutralinos they tend to have masses either of order $m_{3/2}$ or, if they are sequestered in LVS, they can be as light as $m\sim M_{\rm P}/{V}^2$~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} and therefore their corresponding stars of mass and radius $M\sim M_{\rm P}\,{V}^4$,  $R\sim {V}^4\, \ell_{\rm p}$. This could lead to compact objects as massive as $M\sim 10^{-2} \,M_\odot  $ and radii $R\sim 10 \, \rm m$ for ${V}\sim 10^9$ in string units. \\

We now turn to the realisation of exotic bosonic compact objects in string theory. String theory features many gravitationally coupled scalar fields called moduli. A generic feature of string compactifications is also the presence of several axionic fields that appear both as phases of open string moduli and as imaginary parts of closed string moduli. In particular, concerning the closed string sector, we are particularly interested in the two-field system composed by a modulus $\tau$ and the corresponding axion $\theta$, whose physics is captured by the following action
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GenericAction}
\mathcal{S} = \int d^4 x\, \mathcal{L} = \int d^4x\, \left[- f(\tau) \left[\partial_\mu \tau \partial^\mu \tau + \partial_\mu \theta \partial^\mu \theta\right] - V(\tau, \theta)\right] \,,
\end{equation}
where the two fields can be identified as the real and imaginary parts of a complex modulus $T = \tau + i \theta$ and $f(\tau) = K_{T \overline{T}}$ is the second derivative of the \Kahler potential $K \equiv K(T + \overline{T})$. Axions can obtain a potential and mass from non-perturbative effects that break the PQ shift-symmetry or can be absorbed by gauge fields in a St\"uckelberg mechanism. In the case of closed string moduli we can organise the scenarios as follows depending on how the PQ shift-symmetry is broken:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}
The first case is for the complex moduli to appear directly in the superpotential $W(\Phi)$ where $W$ can come from tree-level effects such as fluxes in Type IIB strings for complex structure moduli or from non-perturbative effects like the blow-up \Kahler moduli (or the overall volume in KKLT).  In this case both scalar and pseudoscalar (axionic) components of the superfield receive a potential and masses of the same order. The effective potential has no conserved current but the fields oscillating around their minima can give rise to boson stars.

\item{}
The second case corresponds to the scenario in which the superpotential does not depend on the modulus field. Therefore the scalar component receives a potential from perturbative effects and the pseudoscalar $\theta$ remains flat. In this case, there is a remaining global shift-symmetry corresponding to the standard PQ shift-symmetry for the axion component $\theta\to \theta + c,$ which is broken non-perturbatively, similar to the situation for the QCD axion. 
This scenario appears naturally for all \Kahler moduli for which a non-perturbative superpotential is hierarchically smaller than perturbative contributions to the potential. Examples are the overall volume and fibre moduli in the LVS~\cite{Cicoli:2008va}, for which the non-perturbative superpotential either does not exist or is exponentially suppressed compared to perturbative contributions arising from the K\"ahler potential. At the level of the perturbative contributions the axions are essentially flat directions.

\item{}
While axions remain flat if the corresponding real field is stabilized perturbatively, they can receive a small mass by non-perturbative effects. The third case corresponds to the study of the lightest axion after integrating all heavier moduli and axions out. This is a simple axion system such as in eq.~\eqref{eq:bound} with the stringy input provided by the expressions of the coefficients in the scalar potential in terms of the integrated string moduli. This is the only case suitable to discuss ultra-light axions in string compactifications since otherwise the mass of the real component of the superfield would be of the same order (as in the first case) and would be ruled out by fifth force constraints.
\end{enumerate}

In general, many compact object configurations can be obtained classically from moduli. However, when including the decay of moduli fields, the lifetime of such objects is limited. As a back of the envelope calculation indicates, such a star can be stable until today if the modulus mass is
\begin{equation}
m \lesssim 10^{-2} \, \text{GeV} \,,
\label{eq:bound2}
\end{equation}
where we assumed a gravitational decay rate $\Gamma\sim m^3/M_{\rm P}^2$. As axions are phenomenologically allowed to satisfy the bound in eq.~\eqref{eq:bound2}, compact axionic objects can in principle be still present in our Universe. Nevertheless, star-like objects could have been relevant in the early Universe. The observational consequences are highly model dependent, at first hand, and the estimate of, for instance, a stochastic GW background will be heavily dependent on the assumptions of the Early Unvierse history. We discuss this further later in Section~\ref{sec:formationall}. Here we discuss several examples which realise the field theory configurations from the previous section. We start with the discussion of axion stars (Sec. \ref{sec:StringyAxionStars}) and continue with moduli stars appearing from real scalar fields (Sec. \ref{sec:ModuliStars}). These are two examples of oscillaton solutions realized in string theory models and can be obtained from the action in eq.~\eqref{eq:GenericAction} in the regimes in which one of the field can be neglected. In particular, axion stars can be easily obtained in the third case described above, after the heavy moduli have been integrated out. Moduli stars on the other hand can be obtained by choosing a specific initial condition that fixes the axion into the origin\footnote{Let us however mention that even an initial displacement in the axionic direction would not change dramatically the results in the subsequent sections, as the equations decouple almost completely in the small amplitude (dilute) regime considered in this paper.}. We then present a realisation of Q-balls using open string fields (Sec.~\ref{sec:OpenStringsQBalls}) and finally an attempt to extend the concept of Q-balls to the two-field system of the second case described above (Sec.~\ref{sec:PQBalls}).

\subsection{Axionic Compact Objects}
\label{sec:StringyAxionStars}

Axion-like particles are a widely studied topic and well-motivated both from the bottom-up perspective and from the top-down approach. In fact, they are a key ingredient of the PQ mechanism to solve the strong CP problem of QCD~\cite{Peccei:1977hh, Wilczek:1977pj, Weinberg:1977ma} and their existence is a generic prediction of string theory~\cite{Conlon:2006tq,Svrcek:2006yi,Arvanitaki:2009fg}. Despite most of the literature emphasise the QCD axion case, many other options for the axion couplings and mass have been considered. The QCD axion could be obtained in string theory compactification mainly as the phase of open string moduli~\cite{Cicoli:2012sz} as getting the axion mass in the right ballpark from closed string axions is non-trivial. In this case miniclusters can be formed as in the field theory scenario if the PQ U$(1)$ symmetry is broken after inflation.


We focus on closed moduli axions in the following, restricting to the third case listed at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:StringCOs}. The LVS provides a concrete and consistent example of a ULDM. The volume axion of the LVS is in fact naturally very light\footnote{The volume axion has a rih phenomenology, as it can act as dark radiation~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Cicoli:2015bpq}.}, being its mass suppressed by a factor $e^{-{V}^{2/3}}$. Hence, it is possible to consistently integrate out all the heavy fields and to be just left with the light volume axion.\footnote{Notice that even though it is relatively easy to get axion masses in the ULA range from non-perturbative effects in string theory, as discussed for instance in~\cite{Hui:2016ltb}, generically, the closed string moduli $\tau$ will receive a mass of the same order as the corresponding axion (since the superpotential is holomorphic) which would violate fifth force bounds. Therefore a different mechanism is required to give a larger mass to $\tau$. Since, unlike $\tau$, the axion mass is protected by the corresponding PQ shift-symmetry which is valid to all orders in perturbation theory, perturbative effects can be the dominant source for the $\tau$ mass whereas non-perturbative effects give mass to the axion. This is precisely what happens in the LVS for $\tau$ the overall volume or a fibre modulus (but not for blow-up modes), allowing the possibility to integrate $\tau$ out and consider only the effective field theory for the axion field.}

To be concrete, let us consider the simplest setup including just two \Kahler moduli $T_b = \tau_b + i \theta_b$ and $T_s = \tau_s + i \theta_s$. The EFT model can be described in terms of a \Kahler potential $K$ and a superpotential $W$:
\begin{equation}
K = - 2 \log\left({V} + \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\right), \, \qquad W = W_0 + A_s e^{- a_s T_s} + A_b e^{- a_b T_b}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\xi} = \xi \langle s\rangle^{3/2}$ ($s$ is the dilaton field) and $A_b$, $A_s$ are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients that depend on the details of the compactification.

The potential arising from such EFT is well-known~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx,Conlon:2005ki}:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left[\frac{8}{3} \left(a_s A_s\right)^2 \frac{\sqrt{\tau_s} e^{-2 a_s \tau_s}}{{V}} - 4 a_s A_s W_0 \frac{\tau_s e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{\mathcal{V}^2} + \frac{3 \xi W_0^2}{4 g_s^{3/2} \mathcal{V}^3}\right] + \delta V_{\text{dS}} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta V_{\text{dS}}$ is an additional contribution needed to achieve a de Sitter vacuum and we have implicitly set $\theta_s = \pi$. The terms containing $\theta_b$ are usually omitted since they are very suppressed. The leading contribution that includes $\theta_b$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
V(\theta_b) \supset \frac{g_s}{2 \pi} a_b A_b \frac{e^{-a_b \tau_b}}{\tau_b^2} \cos\left(a_b \tau_b\, \theta_b\right) \,.
\end{equation} 
Therefore we have a realisation of the simple single-field axion Lagrangian in eq.~\eqref{eq:bound} and the mass of the axion is then\footnote{We assume that the term $\delta V_{\rm dS}$ in the potential uplifts the minimum of the full potential to the current value of the cosmological constant.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:VolumeAxionMass}
m_{\theta_b} = \sqrt{\frac{g_s A_b a_b^3}{2 \pi}} \, {e^{- \frac{a_b \tau_b}{2}}} \,.
\end{equation}
The effective field theory is valid for volumes of order  $\mathcal{V} \gtrsim 10^3$ ($\tau_b\gtrsim 10^2$) which implies that approximately $m_{\theta_b}\lesssim 10^{-22}$ eV (by taking e.g.~$A_b = 1$, $g_s = 0.1$ and $10^{-1} \lesssim a_b \lesssim 1$) and therefore $\theta_b$ is a good candidate to be ULDM, although lighter and less constrained masses are also possible. In the case $\tau_b \simeq 10^3,$ the volume of the compact dimensions is ${V} \simeq 3 \times 10^4$. This value of the volume implies a high scale of supersymmetry breaking, with a gravitino mass of order $m_{3/2} \simeq 3 \times 10^{13} \, \rm GeV$. 

It is interesting to ask whether it is possible to get the analogue of axion miniclusters with this ULA. As we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:bosonstarsinfieldtheory} the formation of miniclusters needs large fluctuations as initial conditions, that grow and collapse during radiation domination (or immediately after the start of matter domination). The first obstruction to this is the fact that there is actually no U$(1)$ symmetry linearly realized in the four-dimensional effective field theory that describes the two-field system composed by the modulus and the corresponding axion. In fact, the shift-symmetry of the volume axion is inherited from the higher dimensional gauge symmetry of the $C_4$ form, rather than coming from a U$(1)$ symmetry. Hence the large initial fluctuations needed for the formation of miniclusters cannot be obtained from PQ U$(1)$ symmetry breaking after inflation as in the QCD axion case. The large initial fluctuations could be generated by  a first order phase transition, as suggested in~\cite{Hardy:2016mns}. However this mechanism does not work for ULAs, since the energy scale $\mu$ of non-perturbative effects that give mass to the axion would be required to be $\mu < \text{MeV}$, which is highly constrained from bounds on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom during BBN~\cite{Hardy:2016mns, Feng:2008mu}. 

\subsection{Moduli Stars}
\label{sec:ModuliStars}

In this section we will show that the same solutions already obtained in~\cite{Ruffini:1969qy, UrenaLopez:2001tw, UrenaLopez:2002gx, Alcubierre:2003sx, Guzman:2004wj, Visinelli:2017ooc} imply that string moduli potentials support star-like solutions in the dilute regime. We will explore the properties and possible phenomenological features of these objects. The actual formation of such objects is partially discussed in Section~\ref{sec:formationall}. As briefly discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:Oscillatons}, the task of finding equilibrium solutions in the dense regime is extremely involved from the numerical point of view, in the case of generic potentials. We leave the numerical analysis of the dense regime including gravity for the future.\\

In the single field case we can canonically normalize the field, so that the action is simply given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ScalarAction}
S = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} \left[- \frac{g^{\mu \nu}}{2} \partial_\mu \varphi \partial_\nu \varphi - V(\varphi)\right]\,.
\end{equation}
We consider a toy model potential that mimics the moduli potential expanded around the minimum in $\varphi = 0$. For the analysis of the dilute regime an expansion up to fourth order is sufficient:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ToyPotential}
V(\varphi) = \frac{m^2}{2} \varphi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{3!} \varphi^3 + \frac{g}{4!} \varphi^4 \,.
\end{equation}
The stringy examples studied below have distinctive properties, first we always observe $\lambda < 0$ and $g > 0$\footnote{Note the dimensions of the couplings $[m] = [\lambda] = 1$ and $[g]=0$.}. This makes these models different from the axionic cases for which $\lambda=0,\,  g<0$. Second, the expansion in $\varphi$ is such that the scale of all couplings is of similar order and therefore the couplings are not strong enough to change substantially the expression for the mass $M\sim M_{\rm P}^2/m$ typical for mini-boson stars to $M\sim M_{\rm P}^3/m^2$. The main reason for this is that there is only one mass scale in the expansion of a potential in string compactifications and once this scale is factorised the dimensionless coefficients are naturally of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. This argument is similar to the argument against realising Starobinsky inflation from string moduli (see for instance the appendix of~\cite{Burgess:2016owb}). \\

In order to study moduli stars we first assume a single harmonic, spherically symmetric ansatz for the background field of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:StarAnsatz}
\varphi(r,t) = \varphi_0(r) \cos\left(\omega t\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\omega = m\left(1+\epsilon\right)$ ($\epsilon < 0$) and $|\epsilon| \ll 1$. We neglect the expansion of the Universe (i.e.~we assume that $m \gg H$) and we include weak gravity effects, encoded in the Newtonian potential $\phi \ll 1$ ($\mathcal{O}\left(\phi\right) \sim \mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon\right)$) appearing in the metric
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LineElement}
ds^2 = - (1+2 \phi) dt^2 + (1-2\phi) \, dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $d\Omega^2$ is the differential solid angle and $\phi$ satisfies the Poisson equation. It is useful to rewrite all the equations in terms of dimensionless variables: we rescale the coordinates $(t,x^i)$, the field $\varphi$ and the energy density $\rho$ as follows
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Rescalings}
\tilde{t} = m t \,, \qquad \tilde{x}^i = m x^i \,, \qquad \tilde{\varphi} = \frac{\varphi}{\Lambda} \,, \qquad \tilde\rho = \frac{\rho}{m^2 \Lambda^2} \,, \qquad \tilde\omega = 1 + \epsilon \,,
\end{equation}
where the scale $\Lambda$ is defined as in Sec.~\ref{sec:Oscillatons}. In the limit $g \rightarrow 0$, neglecting the gradient energy\footnote{We approximate here the total energy as $\tilde\rho = \dot{\tilde{\varphi}}^2/2 + \tilde{\varphi}^2/2 \approx \tilde\varphi_0^2/2$ which along with the Poisson equation implies that $\phi$ can be taken to be static in the dilute appoximation.} and taking $\Lambda = M_{\rm P}$ for the moment\footnote{In the limit of vanishing interactions, the $(\Lambda/M_{\rm P})^2$ term that would appear in the Poisson equation if $\Lambda \neq M_{\rm P}$ could be reabsorbed through the rescaling of the field in eq.~\eqref{eq:Rescalings}.}, the physical system is described by the following equations
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SPField}
\tilde{\varphi}_0''(\tilde{r}) + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \tilde{\varphi}'_0(\tilde{r}) & = 2 \left(\phi(\tilde{r}) - \epsilon\right) \tilde{\varphi}_0(\tilde{r}) \,, \\
\phi''(\tilde{r}) + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \phi'(\tilde{r}) & = \frac{\tilde{\varphi}_0^2(\tilde{r})}{4}\,,
\label{eq:SPPoisson}
\end{align}
where all the derivatives are taken with respect to the rescaled variables. In the limit of vanishing interactions the solutions of this system obey a scaling relation~\cite{Ruffini:1969qy}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Scaling}
\left(\tilde{r}, \tilde{\varphi}, \phi, \epsilon\right) \quad \longrightarrow \quad \left(\tilde{r}/\zeta, \zeta^2 \tilde{\varphi}, \zeta^2 \phi, \zeta^2 \epsilon\right) \,.
\end{equation}
This can be used to find all solutions in the dilute regime. In particular, small amplitude solutions can be obtained from generic solutions by rescaling with $\zeta \ll 1$. The boundary conditions follow from requiring asymptotic flatness and a regular solution at $\tilde{r} = 0$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BCvarphi0}
\tilde\varphi(0) = \tilde\varphi_{\rm core} \,, \qquad \tilde\varphi'(0) = 0 \,, \qquad \tilde\varphi(\infty) = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BCphip0}
\phi'(0) = 0 \,, \qquad \phi(\infty) = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
In practice, in the dilute regime one can use the scaling in eq.~\eqref{eq:Scaling} to fix $\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = 1$ and then vary $\phi(0)$ and $\epsilon$ until the correct boundary conditions at $\tilde{r} \gg 1$ is found via a shooting method.\\

\noindent The solution to the system in eq.s~\eqref{eq:SPField},~\eqref{eq:SPPoisson} can be written in integral form as~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx, Guzman:2004wj}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:IntegralSystem1}
\tilde{\varphi}_0(\tilde{r}) & = 1 + 2 \int_0^{\tilde{r}} dr' \, r' \left(1 - \frac{r'}{\tilde{r}}\right) \left(\phi(r') - \epsilon\right) \tilde{\varphi}_0(r') \,, \\
\phi(\tilde{r}) & = \phi(0) + \int_0^{\tilde{r}} dr' \, r' \, \frac{\tilde{\varphi}^2_0(r')}{4} - \frac{\tilde{M}(\tilde{r})}{8 \pi \,\tilde{r}} \,,
\label{eq:IntegralSystem2}
\end{align}
where we defined $\tilde{M}$ of the star through the relations\footnote{We write the generic expression for the mass with $\Lambda \neq M_{\rm P}$ for future reference.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MassDef}
M(r) = \left(\frac{\Lambda^2}{m}\right) \tilde{M}(\tilde{r}) \,, \qquad \tilde{M}(\tilde{r}) = 4 \pi \int_0^{\tilde{r}} d\tilde{r}'\, \tilde{r}'^2 \tilde{\rho}(\tilde{r}') \, .
\end{equation}
Notice that in the dilute regime, asymptotic flatness implies that at $\tilde{r} \gg 1$ the Newtonian potential scales as $\phi(\tilde{r}) \sim -\tilde{M}/\tilde{r}$ and this condition fixes the value of $\phi(0)$ in eq. \eqref{eq:IntegralSystem2}. We will parametrize the solutions using both the dimensionless total mass $\tilde{M}$ defined as in eq.~\eqref{eq:MassDef} (with $\tilde{r} \rightarrow \infty$) and the radius of the star $\tilde{R}_{90}$, defined as the radius that contains $90\%$ of the total mass of the star. It is straightforward to check that the rescaling in eq.~\eqref{eq:Rescalings} acts on $\tilde{M}$ and $\tilde{R}_{90}$ as follows
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ScalingMassRadius}
\left(\tilde{M}, \tilde{R}_{90}\right) \quad \longrightarrow \quad \left(\zeta \tilde{M}, \zeta^{-1} \tilde{R}_{90}\right) \,.
\end{equation}

In order to marginally take into account the first interaction terms in the potential in eq.~\eqref{eq:ToyPotential} we rescale it and the total energy density
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RescaledPotRho}
\tilde{V} = \frac{\tilde\varphi^2}{2} + \tilde{\lambda} \frac{\tilde{\varphi}^3}{3!} + \tilde{g} \frac{\tilde\varphi^4}{4!} \,, \qquad \tilde{\rho} = \frac{\left(\dot{\tilde\varphi}\right)^2}{2} + \frac{\left(\tilde\varphi'\right)^2}{2} + \tilde{V} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have redefined the dimensionless couplings
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda \Lambda}{m^2} \,, \qquad \tilde{g} = \frac{g \Lambda^2}{m^2} \,.
\end{equation}
The equation of motion (dropping subleading terms) and the Poisson equation are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EOMStarTBS}
\tilde\varphi'' + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \tilde\varphi' & = \left(2 \phi + 1 - \tilde\omega^2\right) \tilde\varphi + \frac{\tilde{\lambda}}{2} \tilde\varphi^2 + \frac{\tilde{g}}{6} \tilde\varphi^3 \,, \\
\phi'' + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \phi' & = \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2 \frac{\tilde\rho}{2} \,.
\end{align}
Following~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc}, after using the ansatz in eq. \eqref{eq:StarAnsatz} it is easier to solve the system by taking an average of the previous equations integrating over a period $2 \pi/\tilde\omega$. Interestingly, the contribution coming from the cubic term of the potential in eq.~\eqref{eq:RescaledPotRho} is averaged out: clearly this is a good approximation as long as the amplitude of the field amplitude is small $\tilde\varphi_0(\tilde{r}) \ll 1$. Using $\tilde\omega^2 \simeq 1 + 2 \epsilon$ we get
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FinalSystem1}
\tilde\varphi_0'' + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \tilde\varphi'_0 & = 2 \left(\phi - \epsilon\right) \tilde\varphi_0 + \frac{\tilde{g}}{8} \tilde\varphi_0^3 = 0 \,, \\
\phi'' + \frac{2}{\tilde{r}} \phi' & = \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2 \left[ \frac{\left(\tilde\varphi_0'\right)^2}{8} + \frac{1 + 2\epsilon}{4} \tilde\varphi_0^2 + \frac{3 \tilde{g}}{16} \frac{\tilde\varphi_0^4}{4!}\right] \,.
\label{eq:FinalSystem2}
\end{align}

It is possible to understand the origin of the existence of these stable solutions by looking at the energy functional of this system, as suggested in~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc, Schiappacasse:2017ham}. After averaging, assuming the star has radius $R$ and using the rescalings in eq.~\eqref{eq:Rescalings}, it takes the form
\begin{align}
E & = -\left(\frac{M}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2 \frac{1}{R} + \int d^3 x\left[\frac{\left(\nabla \tilde\varphi_0\right)^2}{2} + \frac{3 \tilde{g}}{8} \frac{\tilde\varphi^4}{4!}\right]  \nonumber \\
& = \frac{\Lambda^2}{m} \left[-\left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2 \frac{\tilde{M}^2}{\tilde{R}} + \alpha \frac{\tilde{M}}{4 \tilde{R}^2} + \frac{1}{4!} \frac{3 \beta \tilde{g}}{8} \frac{\tilde{M}}{\tilde{R}^3}\right] \,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients to be determined by matching the energy functional with the numerical solutions and we hae used that $M \simeq \int d^3x\, m^2 \varphi_0^2 = \frac{\Lambda^2}{m} \varphi_0^2 \tilde{R}^3 = \frac{\Lambda^2}{m} \tilde{M}$.
It is possible to extremize the energy functional with respect to the radius $\tilde{R}$. The solution of $\partial E/\partial \tilde{R}$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RStable}
\tilde{R}_{\rm stable} = \frac{1}{4 (\Lambda/M_{\rm P})^2} \left[\frac{\alpha}{\tilde{M}} + \sqrt{\frac{\alpha^2}{\tilde{M}^2} + \frac{3 \beta \tilde{g}}{4} \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2} \right]\,,
\end{equation}
and it can be easily checked that it is always a minimum of $E$, hence a stable solution\footnote{Stability in this section should be understood as stability against radial perturbations of the star. There is no physical law preventing the moduli composing the star from decaying gravitationally.}. The expression for $\tilde{R}_{\rm stable}$ is inversely proportional to the mass $\tilde{R} \propto 1/\tilde{M}$ for small values of the mass. In this regime the stability comes from the balance between the gradient energy (repulsive) and gravity (attractive). In the limit of large mass $\tilde{M}$ the radius tends to a constant, which depends on the coupling constant $\tilde{g}$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AsymptoticRadius}
R_{\rm stable} \rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3 \beta \tilde{g}}}{8 (\Lambda/M_{\rm P})} \,.
\end{equation}
This limit is achieved in the regime in which the interaction terms are important, namely for a core amplitude $\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} \lesssim 1$. Since we will consider stringy potentials expanded around the minimum truncated at quartic order, we will never be allowed to explore this regime and trust the truncation at the same time: when the core amplitude is of order $\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} \lesssim 1$ all the higher order interactions should be included.

\subsubsection{Overall volume modulus in KKLT and the LVS}

We first consider the potential for the canonically normalized volume modulus $\tilde\varphi = \frac{\varphi}{M_{\rm P}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \ln {V}$ in the LVS. Following~\cite{Cicoli:2016olq}, we can write the uplifted potential for the volume modulus $\varphi$ (after having integrated out the blow-up moduli) in terms of two parameters\footnote{In principle there could be also the parameter $\gamma$ that denotes the power of the volume of the uplifting contribution to the scalar potential $V_{\rm dS} \propto {V}^{-\gamma}$ (it has to be in the range $1 \lesssim \gamma < 3$). Given that the results do not depend on its value, in the following we set it to $\gamma = 2$.}, the overall normalization $V_0$ and the position of the minimum $\langle\varphi\rangle:$ 
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm LVS}(\varphi) = 3 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{1/4} V_0\, e^{-3 \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \tilde{\varphi}} \left[\langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle^{1/2} e^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \left(\tilde{\varphi} - \langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle\right)} - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \left(\tilde{\varphi}^{3/2} - \langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle^{3/2}\right) - \langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle^{1/2}\right]\,,
\end{equation}
where the normalization is $V_0 = \frac{3 P |W_0|^2}{4}$ and $P$ is a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficient that depends on the details of the compactification space, see~\cite{Cicoli:2016olq} for details.\\

We use as reference value $\langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle = 14$, which corresponds to a volume of ${V} \simeq 2.8 \times 10^7$, and we expand around the minimum of the potential $\tilde{\varphi} = \langle\tilde{\varphi}\rangle + \delta\tilde{\varphi}$ but the results are basically independent of the exact value of the volume. The potential is plotted in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Potentials}. The expansion up to quartic order reads\footnote{Notice that even if the couplings (both in the LVS and in the KKLT case) look larger than $1$, the expansion is always under control as long as $\delta \tilde{\varphi} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ (or $\delta \tilde\chi \lesssim 10^{-2}$ in the KKLT case). This expansion is then not fully under control for the first numerical solution in Tab. \ref{tab:ParametersShooting} for which $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = 10^{-1}$.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LVSPotential}
\tilde{V}_{\rm LVS}(\delta\tilde\varphi) \simeq \frac{\delta\tilde\varphi^2}{2} - \tilde{\lambda}_{\rm LVS} \frac{\delta\tilde\varphi^3}{3!} + \tilde{g}_{\rm LVS}\frac{\delta\tilde\varphi^4}{4!} + \dots \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LVSCoefficients}
\tilde{\lambda}_{\rm LVS} \simeq 9.75 \, \qquad \text{and} \, \qquad \tilde{g}_{\rm LVS} \simeq 63.8\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:Potentials}
\end{figure}

Concerning KKLT, we consider the potential~\cite{Kachru:2003aw}
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm KKLT}(\tau) = \frac{a A e^{-a \tau}}{2 \tau^2} \left[\frac{a A}{3} \tau e^{-a \tau} + W_0 + A e^{-a \tau}\right] + \frac{D}{\tau^3} \,,
\end{equation}
where $W_0 = - 10^{-4}$, $a=0.1$, $A=1$, $D = 3 \times 10^{-9}$ but again the results are independent of the exact value of the parameters, provided that the potential has a dS minimum. The de Sitter minimum of $V_{\rm KKLT}$ in terms of the canonically normalized field $\tilde\chi = \frac{\chi}{M_{\rm P}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \log\,\tau$ is located at $\langle\chi\rangle \simeq 5.8$. This potential is plotted in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Potentials} in terms of the field expanded around the minimum $\tilde{\chi} = \langle\tilde{\chi}\rangle + \delta\tilde{\chi}$. The expansion of the potential up to quartic order is
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_{\rm KKLT}(\delta\tilde\chi) \simeq \frac{\delta\tilde\chi^2}{2} - \tilde{\lambda}_{\rm KKLT} \frac{\delta\tilde\chi^3}{3!} + \tilde{g}_{\rm KKLT}\frac{\delta\tilde\chi^4}{4!} + \dots \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KKLTCoefficients}
\tilde{\lambda}_{\rm KKLT} \simeq 30.6 \, \qquad \text{and} \, \qquad \tilde{g}_{\rm KKLT} \simeq 652.9\,.
\end{equation}
To clarify the notation, the ansatz in eq. \eqref{eq:StarAnsatz} takes the form
\begin{equation}
\delta\tilde\varphi(r) = \delta \tilde\varphi_0(r) \cos \left(\tilde\omega \tilde{t}\right) \,, \qquad \delta\tilde\chi(r) = \delta \tilde\chi_0(r) \cos \left(\tilde\omega \tilde{t}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
for the LVS and the KKLT volume moduli respectively. We numerically solve eq.s~\eqref{eq:FinalSystem1} and~\eqref{eq:FinalSystem2} as described above, varying the initial core amplitude of the field in the ranges $(10^{-6},10^{-1})$ in the LVS case\footnote{As already mentioned, the truncation in eq. \eqref{eq:LVSPotential} is not a good approximation for the solution with $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = 10^{-1}$. We however include it to show that, assuming the potential is exactly the one in eq. \eqref{eq:LVSPotential} we get the flattening expected in the case of repulsive interactions~\cite{Schiappacasse:2017ham}.} and $(10^{-6},10^{-2})$ for the KKLT potential\footnote{As the core amplitude gets larger and larger the numerics become more and more difficult especially in the KKLT case for which the interaction coupling $g_{\rm KKLT}$ is large.}. We find that both potentials support star-like solutions and that they coincide in the dilute regime where basically only the mass term in the potential is relevant. We report the values of the parameters for the LVS case in Tab.~\ref{tab:ParametersShooting}. Notice that the scaling in eq.~\eqref{eq:Scaling} and eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalingMassRadius} is manifest in the dilute regime where $\delta\tilde{\varphi}_{\rm core} \lesssim 10^{-3}$. We also report as an example the field profile $\delta\tilde\varphi_0(r)$ and the Newtonian potential in the LVS case with $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = 10^{-6}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:StarProfile}. In the Newtonian potential we also plot (red dots) the last term in eq. \eqref{eq:IntegralSystem2} to show the asymptotic behaviour $\phi(\tilde{r}) \sim - \tilde{M}(\tilde{r})/\tilde{r}$ at large $\tilde{r}$.

The dashed blue line corresponds to the fit of numerical data using the function in eq.~\eqref{eq:RStable}, varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Even though we use $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = 10^{-1}$ as maximum value for the core amplitude, the results should be trusted up to a core amplitude of $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$. This follows from previous studies of the dilute regime for the free field case (or Newtonian oscillatons)~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx} and from the observations that for larger core amplitudes the deviation from the single harmonic approximation in eq.~\eqref{eq:StarAnsatz} piles up quickly, invalidating the solution. In this case the single harmonic approximation in eq.~\eqref{eq:StarAnsatz} should be replaced by a Fourier expansion~\cite{UrenaLopez:2001tw, UrenaLopez:2002gx} and higher order interaction terms should be included in the potential. This procedure has the drawback that stable solutions can be found only for specific interaction potentials (quartic) and for small values of the couplings~\cite{UrenaLopez:2012zz}. As we will show in a forthcoming publication\footnote{And as it has already been shown for the axion potential in~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl}.}, it is more fruitful to directly study the evolution of the system using a full GR simulation code~\cite{Clough:2015sqa}\footnote{This has also drawbacks: first, as the simulation starts from an arbitrary initial condition, it is not certain that equilibrium configurations (even if they exist), can be found in this way. Second, the stability of the configuration can only be checked on a time interval as long as the simulation time, which is often short.}. However, we can take the results plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:MassRadiusPlot} as the clear indication that different couplings in the potential play a crucial role in determining the mass spectrum of moduli stars in the dense regime that in turn affects the GW spectrum produced by the dynamics of moduli stars.\\

Assuming that the expression for the mass reported in eq.~\eqref{eq:MassEnhancement} is valid in the real field case, and that effectively the leading interaction terms in the LVS and KKLT potential is the quartic one (i.e.~that the cubic is approximately averaged out also in the dense regime), we get an enhancement of the mass of the star of order $\tilde{g}^{1/2}_{\rm LVS} \simeq 8$ in the LVS case and $\tilde{g}^{1/2}_{\rm KKLT} \simeq 16$ in the KKLT case. In both cases the enhancement factor is much smaller than $M_{\rm P}/m$ due to the smallness of the coupling $g$: the Chandrasekar limit in eq.~\eqref{eq:MassEnhancement} is never achieved.

\subsubsection{Blow-up-like potentials}

In this section we study the following phenomenological potential for the canonically normalized modulus $\sigma$
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm bu} (\sigma) = V_0 \left(1 - e^{a\, \sqrt{{V}} \,\frac{\sigma}{M_{\rm P}}}\right)^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is an overall normalization that depends on the details of the compactification, $a$ is typically an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameter and the potential has a zero-energy minimum in $\sigma = 0$. This potential mimics that of blow-up moduli in the LVS and ${V}$ is the volume of the compactification space. The mass of blow up moduli is $m_{\rm bu} \simeq \mathcal{O}\left(1\right)/{V}$ while the scale $\Lambda$ is essentially given by the string scale $M_{\rm s} = M_{\rm P}/\sqrt{{V}}$. In terms of the rescaled field
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\sigma} = \frac{\sigma}{M_s} = \sqrt{{V}} \,\frac{\sigma}{M_{\rm P}} \,,
\end{equation}
the rescaled scalar potential takes the simple form
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_{\rm bu}\left(\tilde{\sigma}\right) = \left(1 - e^{a \tilde{\sigma}}\right)^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where the normalization $V_0$ disappears after the rescalings in eq.~\eqref{eq:Rescalings} are performed and we will take $a=1$ for numerical computations. The Taylor expansion around the minimum of this scalar potential takes again the form
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm bu}(\tilde{\varphi}) \simeq \frac{\tilde{\sigma}}{2} - \frac{\tilde{\lambda}_{\rm bu}}{3!} \tilde\sigma^3 + \frac{\tilde{g}_{\rm bu}}{4!} \tilde\sigma^4 + \dots \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\lambda}_{\rm bu} = 3 \,, \qquad \tilde{g}_{\rm bu} = 7 \,.
\end{equation}
Repeating the analysis outlined in the former section we find the results summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:MassRadiusBlowUp}. These results are essentially equivalent to the dilute regime studied in~\cite{Visinelli:2017ooc} in the case of axion stars (for the QCD axion). The red region correspond to the region where gravity is negligible and the potential supports oscillon formation, as already numerically studied in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}. The blue region in Fig.~\ref{fig:MassRadiusBlowUp} corresponds to core amplitudes $\tilde\sigma_{\rm core }\gtrsim~10^{-3}$, where we can no longer trust the single harmonic approximation. Finally, the green region corresponds to the case in which interactions become important (even though the background amplitude is small) due to the large mass of the star. In other words the second term under the square root in eq.~\eqref{eq:RStable} becomes dominant over the first one which is suppressed by the large mass of the star:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\left(\Lambda/M_{\rm P}\right)^2}{1/\tilde{M}^2} \gg 1 \quad \text{for} \quad \Lambda/M_{\rm P} \simeq 10^{-4} \quad \text{and} \quad \tilde{M} \gtrsim 10^{5} \,.
\end{equation}
However, we expect that higher order interaction terms will quickly become important in this region, and we hence cannot completely trust the results. Finally, even though we can take the results in the blue and green regions as indications of what happens when interactions become important and the single harmonic approximation breaks down, these regimes need a more careful numerical study that we will present in a forthcoming publication.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Estimates of masses and sizes}
It is interesting to translate the dimensionless numbers into real masses and radii. In general the masses and radii can be written as
\begin{align}
M/\tilde{M} & = \frac{\Lambda^2}{M_{\rm P}^2} \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m} \simeq \frac{\Lambda^2}{M_{\rm P}^2} \, \left(\frac{100 \, \text{TeV}}{m}\right) \times 10^8 \, \text{g} \,, \\
R/\tilde{R} & = 1/m \simeq 2 \times \left(\frac{100 \, \text{TeV}}{m}\right) \times 10^{-19} \, \text{cm} \,,
\end{align}
where $\tilde{M}$ and $\tilde{R}$ are the dimensionless numbers previously determined numerically and can vary by a few orders of magnitude.\\

Being in string compactification we can express all the masses and sizes in terms of the compactification space volume ${V}$. We start form the blow-up-like case for which star mass takes the form
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm bu}/\tilde{M} = \left(\frac{M_{\rm s}}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^2 \times {V} \times M_{\rm P} = M_{\rm P} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{M}$ can be read in Fig.~\ref{fig:MassRadiusBlowUp}. The radii on the other hand
\begin{equation}
R_{\rm bu}/\tilde{R} \simeq \left(5 \times \ell_{\rm P}\right) \times {V} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{R} \gtrsim 100$ can be read again in Fig.~\ref{fig:MassRadiusBlowUp}.\\

The mass of the volume modulus in KKLT is
\begin{equation}
 m_{\rm KKLT}\simeq m_{3/2}\log{\left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{m_{3/2}}\right)} \,,
\end{equation}
where the suppression of the gravitino mass compared to the Planck scale arises from a hierarchically small expectation value of the superpotential
\begin{equation}
 m_{3/2}=M_{\rm P} e^{K/2} |\langle W\rangle| \simeq M_{\rm P} \frac{|W_0|}{{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
Assuming that the modulus has already decayed gravitationally before BBN, the mass of the volume modulus is constrained to be larger than $\simeq 100 \,{\rm TeV}.$ Different hierarchies are achieved by different amount of flux tuning. The typical field range corresponds to $\Lambda=M_{\rm P}$ as discussed previously. Hence the estimate for the mass and radius become in this case
\begin{align}
 M_{\rm KKLT}/\tilde{M} & \simeq M_{\rm P} {V} |W_0|^{-1}\,,\\
 R_{\rm KKLT}/\tilde{R} & \simeq M_{\rm P}^{-1} {V} |W_0|^{-1}\,.
\end{align}
The mass of the volume modulus ${V}$ in the LVS takes the form~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Conlon:2005ki}
\begin{equation}
m_{{V}} = \mathcal{O}(1) \frac{|W_0|}{\sqrt{4 \pi} g_s^{1/4}} \frac{M_{\rm P}}{{V}^{3/2}} \,,
\end{equation}
and for the following estimates we take $\frac{\mathcal{O}(1)|W_0|}{\sqrt{4 \pi} g_s^{1/4}} = 1$ which is easily achievable in the landscape, we can rewrite $M$ in terms of the volume ${V}$ as
\begin{equation}
M_{{V}}/\tilde{M} \simeq \, M_{\rm P} \, {V}^{3/2}  \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{M} \lesssim 2$. In the same way, the radius of the star is given in term of the volume ${V}$ by
\begin{equation}
R_{{V}}/\tilde{R} \simeq \left(5 \times \ell_{\rm P}\right) \times {V}^{3/2} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{R} \gtrsim 30$.\\

\subsubsection*{Phenomenology of the LVS volume modulus}

There are two phenomenologically allowed windows for ${V}$ in the LVS. The first case arises by assuming that the modulus (and hence the star) has already decayed gravitationally. In order not to spoil BBN we require that the volume modulus decays before its start. Since ${V}$ is coupled gravitationally, this condition translates into
\begin{equation}
\tau_{{V}} =\Gamma^{-1} \lesssim H_{\rm BBN}^{-1} \,,
\end{equation}
for the lifetime of the volume modulus $\tau_{{V}}$, where $\Gamma \simeq m_{{V}}^3/M_{\rm P}^2$ and $H_{\rm BBN}^2 \simeq T_{\rm BBN}^{2}/M_{\rm P}$ with $T_{\rm BBN} \simeq 3 \, \text{MeV}$. We also need to require that the volume is large enough to trust the effective field theory. Summarizing these conditions in terms of the volume we can write
\begin{equation}
10^3 \lesssim {V} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{9} \,,
\end{equation}
that corresponds to the following windows for the masses and the radii of the stars
\begin{equation}
0.1 \, \text{g} \lesssim M_{{V}}/\tilde{M} \lesssim 3.8 \times 10^8 \, \text{g} \,, \qquad 2.6 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{cm} \lesssim R_{{V}}/\tilde{R} \lesssim  7.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{cm}\,.
\end{equation}
These objects turn out to be very massive microscopic objects.\\

The second window corresponds to values of the compactification volume ${V}$ such that the volume modulus has not decayed yet. We require that
\begin{equation}
\tau_{{V}} \gtrsim H_0^{-1}\,,
\end{equation}
where $H_0 \simeq 10^{-33} \, \text{eV}$. Such condition translates into $m_{{V}} \lesssim 10^{-2} \, \text{GeV}$ that can be rewritten in terms of the volume as ${V} \gtrsim 10^{13}$. For $\mathcal{V} \sim 10^{13}$, the string scale is $M_s \sim 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$, the KK scale is $M_{\rm KK} \sim M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^{2/3} \sim 10^9 \, \text{GeV}$ and the gravitino mass is $m_{3/2} \sim M_{\rm P}/{V} \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$, in accordance with LHC findings. The mass and radii of the stars for ${V} = 10^{13}$ are
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MassSizeNYD}
M_{{V}}/{\tilde{M}} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{14} \, \text{g} \,, \qquad R_{{V}}/{\tilde{R}} \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}\,.
\end{equation}

Since an oscillating massive scalar field redshifts as pressureless dust, if the volume modulus has not decayed yet it constitutes dark matter. For this reason we need to ensure that the presence of this field does not overclose the Universe. Assuming that the volume modulus is displaced from the minimum of the potential after inflation, it start oscillating when $m_{{V}} \sim H$, which translates into a temperature of $T_i \sim 10^8 \, \text{GeV} \gg T_{\rm BBN} \sim 1 \, \text{MeV}$. Since its energy density redshifts as matter, it ends up dominating the energy density of the Universe. The moment in which it starts dominating depends on the initial energy density stored in the modulus, which is roughly $\rho_i \sim m_{{V}}^2 \varphi_i^2$, where $\varphi_i$ is the value of the initial displaced field. Moreover the energy density stored in the field redshifts as
\begin{equation}
\rho_\varphi(t) = m_{{V}}^2 \varphi_i^2 \left(\frac{a_i}{a(t)}\right)^3 \,,
\end{equation}
while the energy density in radiation
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm rad}(t) = m_{{V}}^2 M_{\rm P}^2 \left(\frac{a_i}{a(t)}\right)^4 \,,
\end{equation}
where we assumed that at $a(t_i) = a_i$ the energy density is dominated by radiation, $\rho \simeq H^2 M_{\rm P}^2$ and $m_{{V}} \sim H$ ($t_i$ denotes the time at the beginning of the oscillations). Now consider $t = t_{\rm eq}$, i.e.~the moment in which the energy densities stored in radiation and matter are equal. Then the ratio of $\rho_{\varphi}$ and $\rho_{\rm rad}$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RatioEDMErad}
\frac{\rho_{\varphi}(t_{\rm eq})}{\rho_{\rm rad}(t_{\rm eq})} \simeq \frac{\varphi_i^2}{M_{\rm P}^2} \frac{a_{\rm eq}}{a_i} \sim 1\,,
\end{equation}
where we made the rough approximation that all the matter energy density is stored in the dark matter candidate field $\varphi$ (in the reality part of it is composed of baryons). From eq.~\eqref{eq:RatioEDMErad} we get for the initial displacement
\begin{equation}
\varphi_i \simeq \left(\frac{a_i}{a_{\rm eq}}\right)^{1/2} M_{\rm P} \simeq \left(\frac{T_{\rm eq}}{T_i}\right)^{1/2} M_{\rm P} \simeq 3 \times 10^{-9} \, M_{\rm P} \,,
\end{equation}
where we used that $T_{\rm eq} \simeq 1 \, \text{eV}$, that during radiation domination $a(t) \sim t^{1/2}$ and we assumed radiation domination from the start of the oscillations to matter-radiation equality. Clearly the initial displacement needs to be very fine-tuned. If there is a mechanism that leads to the growth of quantum fluctuations of the volume modulus, compact objects like the previously studied stars could be formed, see Section~\ref{sec:formationall}, with a core amplitude even larger than $\varphi_i$. In such a case part or even the full abundance of dark matter could be composed of microscopic solitonic objects with mass and size given in eq. \eqref{eq:MassSizeNYD}.

\subsubsection{GW production}

The production of GWs would need a careful non-linear analysis of the dynamics of formation and dynamics of the compact objects described in the previous sections, and we leave it for future work. In particular, a numerical study is needed to get the amplitude of the stochastic GW background generated by the dynamics of stars. However we can make some estimates about the frequency of the produced GWs. If the single harmonic approximation holds and the star profile is exactly spherically symmetric as described in the previous section, a single star cannot produce GWs\footnote{It is however expected that a single star in the dense regime can produce GWs as it happens for oscillons~\cite{Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz}.}. However, a possible source for GW production is given by binaries: after their formation in the early Universe, moduli stars can decouple from the Universe expansion and form binary systems. The energy loss in GWs is compensated by a decrease in the distance beween the compact objects and an increase of the frequency. If the time available between the formation of the binary system and the decay of the corresponding modulus is sufficiently long, the orbiting compact objects merge, producing a burst of GWs. If the time is not sufficient for the stars to merge, they will orbit until they disappear due to the decay of the modulus. Since we do not know the initial distance between the moduli stars at their formation, we can only put bounds on the maximum frequency of the GWs produced by the system. This is given by the frequency associated to the \textit{innermost stable circular orbit} (ISCO) orbit (see for instance~\cite{Giudice:2016zpa})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FreqISCO}
f_{\rm ISCO} \simeq \frac{1}{\left(6 \pi\right)^{3/2}} \frac{C^{3/2}}{M_{\rm tot} M_{\rm P}} = \frac{1}{2 \left(6 \pi\right)^{3/2}} \frac{\tilde{C}^{3/2}}{\tilde{M}} \left(\frac{\Lambda}{M_{\rm P}}\right) m \,,
\end{equation}
where we defined the (dimensionless) compactness parameter in eq. \eqref{eq:CompactnessDef} (and below) and we used that $M_{\rm tot} = 2 M$. The factor $\Lambda/M_{\rm P}$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:FreqISCO} suppresses the GW frequency at emission with respect to the value of the mass, if $\Lambda < M_{\rm P}$. However, in order for the compact objects to merge it is necessary that the coalescence time $t_{\rm coal}$ is smaller than the available time between the formation of the binary and the decay of the modulus:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MergerCond}
t_{\rm coal} < t_{\rm dec} - t_{\rm form} \,.
\end{equation}
The coalescence time for two stars with equal mass $M$ under the assumption of circular orbit is given by~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm coal} \simeq  \frac{d_0^4 \, M_{\rm P}^6}{M^3} = \frac{\alpha^4}{m} \, \frac{\tilde{M}}{\tilde{C}^4} \left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{\Lambda}\right)^6 \,,
\end{equation}
where $d_0$ is the initial distance between the two compact objects, that we wrote in terms of the star radius\footnote{The correct value of the parameter $\alpha$ is expected to be the outcome of numerical studies of the formation of the stars, and is related to the distribution of these compact objects.} $R$ as $d_0 = \alpha R$. This time has to be compared with\footnote{The formation time of the binary is larger than the formation time of the star which is in turn larger than $1/m$. However the the estimate in eq.~\eqref{eq:TdecTform} is valid for most scales that go non-linear and form compact objects, see Section~\ref{sec:formationall}.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TdecTform}
t_{\rm dec} - t_{\rm form} \simeq t_{\rm dec} \approx \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m^3} \,,
\end{equation}
where we used that $t_{\rm form} \ll t_{\rm dec} \simeq M_{\rm P}^2/m^3$. In the case of the LVS volume modulus $\Lambda = M_{\rm P}$ and the condition that the merger of the stars take place is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AlphaBound}
\alpha < \left(\frac{{V}^3}{\tilde{M}}\right)^{1/4} \tilde{C} \,.
\end{equation}
that can be satisfied by the denser objects and for large values of the volume ${V}$. In the case of blow-up-like moduli the scale $\Lambda$ is the string scale $M_s \simeq M_{\rm P}/\sqrt{{V}}$ and the condition in eq.~\eqref{eq:MergerCond} translates into
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha^4 \tilde{M}}{\tilde{C}^4} \left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{M_{\rm s}}\right)^6 \sim \frac{\alpha^4 \tilde{M}}{\tilde{C}^4} {V}^3  < \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{m^2} \sim {V}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
This is clearly never satisfied for $\alpha \gtrsim 1$: the blow-up-like moduli stars do not have time to merge before disappearing due to the decay of the modulus.\\

We find that the dimensionless compactness for the LVS and KKLT volume moduli is included in the range
\begin{equation}
8 \times 10^{-6} \lesssim \tilde{C} \lesssim 1.39 \,,
\end{equation}
for the numerical solutions reported in Fig. \ref{fig:MassRadiusPlot}\footnote{In~\cite{Giudice:2016zpa} conventions this should be divided by $8 \pi$, giving a compactness $\sim 0.055 < 0.16$ which is the maximum compactness for interacting boson stars~\cite{AmaroSeoane:2010qx}. However, recall that solutions with $\delta \tilde\varphi_{\rm core} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ are not fully reliable for the reasons explained in Sec. \ref{sec:ModuliStars}.}. The maximum compactness in the dilute region $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ is $\tilde{C} \simeq 7.8 \times 10^{-3}$. In terms of the modulus mass $m$, the maximum frequency from mergers $f_{\rm ISCO}$ is contained in the range
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FrequencyWindow}
1.3 \times 10^{-6} \lesssim f_{\rm ISCO}/m \lesssim 3.6 \times 10^{-4} \,,
\end{equation}
where the upper bound corresponds to $\delta\tilde{\varphi}_{\rm core} = \delta\tilde\chi_{\rm core} = 10^{-1}$. The upper bound corresponding to the largest core amplitude in the dilute region $\delta\tilde\varphi_{\rm core} = \delta\tilde\chi_{\rm core} = 10^{-1}$ would be $f_{\rm ISCO}/m \simeq 4.1 \times 10^{-5}$. We recall that, in Hertz units
\begin{equation}
m \simeq 1.5 \times \left(\frac{m}{100 \, \text{TeV}}\right) \times 10^{29} \, \text{Hz}\,.
\end{equation}
Since the blow-up-like moduli stars do not have time to merge, they emit GWs with frequency twice the orbital period, under the assumption of stationary orbit. Its value would typically be much smaller than the corresponding ISCO frequency but in order to compute it, the distribution of distances between stars is needed, and we leave it for future work.\\

The frequency values obtained from mergers refer to the emission time and have to be redshifted to take into account the expansion of the Universe. Assuming that the emission takes at $t_{\rm e}$, the dilution factor is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R} = \frac{a(t_{\rm e})}{a(t_{\rm R})} \frac{a(t_{\rm R})}{a(t_0)} \,,
\end{equation}
where $t_{\rm e}$ is the GW production time, $t_{\rm R}$ is the reheating time (given by the decay of the modulus) and $t_0$ is today. We can estimate
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Redshift}
\frac{a(t_{\rm R})}{a(t_0)} = \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm rad}(t_0)}{\rho_{\rm rad}(t_{\rm R})}\right)^{1/4} = \left(\frac{\pi^2}{30} g_* (t_{\rm R})\right)^{-1/4} \frac{M_{\rm P}^{1/2}}{m^{3/2}} \, \rho_{\rm rad}^{1/4}(t_0) \,,
\end{equation}
where we used that radiation redshifts as $\rho_{\rm rad} \propto a^{-4}$, $g_* (t_{\rm R})$ is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at reheating and the decay rate of a gravitationally coupled modulus of mass $m$ is $\Gamma \simeq m^3/M_{\rm P}^2$. Moreover $\rho_{\rm rad} (t_0) \simeq 4.3 \times 10^{-5} \rho_{\rm crit}$. Neglecting the numerical prefactor in eq. \eqref{eq:Redshift} the suppression factor is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Suppression1}
\frac{M_{\rm P}^{1/2}}{m^{3/2}} \rho_{\rm rad}^{1/4}(t_0) \approx \left(\frac{100 \, \text{TeV}}{m}\right)^{3/2} \, 10^{-11} \,.
\end{equation}
In order to compute the factor $a(t_{\rm e})/a(t_{\rm R})$ a numerical computation of the emission time $t_{\rm e}$ is needed. To give an estimate, this factor is bound to be
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Suppression2}
\frac{a(t_{\rm e})}{a\left(t_{\rm R}\right)} > \left(\frac{t_{\rm e}}{t_{\rm R}} \right)^{2/3} \simeq \left(\frac{m}{M_{\rm P}}\right)^{4/3} \simeq  1.5 \times \left(\frac{m}{100 \, \text{TeV}}\right)^{4/3} \times 10^{-18} \,,
\end{equation}
where the right hand side is computed assuming that the stars are formed immediately after the modulus starts oscillating, that GWs are produced immediately after the formation of the stars and that the Universe is always matter dominated from the start of the oscillations to the modulus decay. This is of course not the realistic situation in which after the start of matter domination the stars have to be first formed (see Sec. \ref{sec:formationall}), then they have to decouple from the expansion of the Universe and form binaries and then they can start emitting GWs. However, the combination of eq. \eqref{eq:Suppression1} and eq. \eqref{eq:Suppression2} gives the indication that it is in principle possible to lower the frequency down to the LIGO range and even lower to the LISA range (taking into account the window given in eq. \eqref{eq:FrequencyWindow}). Of course, as GWs redshift as radiation ($\rho_{\rm rad} \propto a^{-4}$), the more the frequency is lowered during matter domination, the more also the GW background amplitude is suppressed and is hard to be observed.\\

Besides the sources mentioned in this section, moduli stars can also produce GWs via other mechanisms that need a careful numerical analysis, such as Bremsstrahlung~\cite{Dolgov:2011cq}. In particular it will be exciting to explore which features the generic decay of the modulus leaves in the GW spectrum. Clearly, a numerical analysis of these phenomena, although highly interesting in the GW astronomy era, is beyond the scope of this article. Such GW signals could shed light on the very first instants of the Universe's history, not accessible within optical astronomy.


 
\subsection{Q-Balls from Open Strings}
\label{sec:OpenStringsQBalls}

The space of open string moduli is vast, model dependent and much unexplored yet.  But there are concrete cases that can be considered. The typical examples are moduli corresponding to the position of D-branes in type II string compactification but also Wilson lines. In the four-dimensional effective field theory they appear as chiral matter multiplets that do not appear in the superpotential  but they may be charged under  Abelian and/or non-Abelian gauge interactions. They can be  part of the observable sector containing the standard model fields or be part of a hidden sector which is coupled only gravitationally to the standard model. 

If the fields do not have holomorphic superpotential couplings the main source of the scalar potential are D-terms. Generically there are many  supersymmetry preserving D-flat directions that correspond to the open string moduli.

In order to explore the possibility of boson stars from open string moduli, a first attempt is to look for non-topological solitons such as Q-balls. At first, the general string theoretical property that no-global symmetries are present in string theory seems to be an obstacle to have Q-balls. There is however a concrete way to have low-energy Abelian symmetries as remnants of anomalous or non-anomalous gauge U$(1)$s for which the gauge field gets a mass by the St\"uckelberg mechanism in which the gauge field absorbs an axion-like field to get a mass but no Higgs field charged under the U$(1)$ gets a vev (see for instance~\cite{Ibanez:2012zz}). In this case a perturbatively exact global U$(1)$ symmetry remains at low-energies which can be the basis of Q-ball solutions.

Following a procedure analogous to an analysis in the MSSM~\cite{Kusenko:1997ad} case, let us consider a number of canonically normalised scalar fields $\Phi_i$ with positive, negative or zero charges under the global U$(1)$. The source of their potential are supersymmetric D-terms of the original local U$(1)$:
\begin{equation}
U_{\rm D}=g^2 \left(\xi-\sum_{i} q_i| \Phi_i|^2\right)^2
\end{equation}
where the Fayet-Iliopoulos coefficient $\xi$ depends on the closed string moduli. In particular for branes at singularities it is proportional to the size of the cycle, i.e.~the resolution of the singularity, and may hence be arbitrarily small. In this case there are solutions of the D-term equations that have vanishing $\Phi_i$ vevs: after the breaking of supersymmetry these fields get potentials from the standard soft-supersymmetry breaking terms:
\begin{equation}
U_{\rm soft}= \sum_{i}m_i^2\, |\Phi_i|^2 + \left(\sum_{ijk} A_{ijk}\, \Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k +\sum_{ij}  B_{ij}\, \Phi_i\Phi_j + h.c.\right),
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $m_i, A_{ijk}, B_{ij}$ are functions of the closed string moduli which are assumed to be stabilised at the supersymmetry breaking minimum~\cite{Choi:2005ge, hep-th/0505076, Aparicio:2014wxa, Aparicio:2015psl}. Since supersymmetry is assumed to be broken in the closed string sector the global U$(1)$ symmetry remains unbroken and these terms are such that only U$(1)$ preserving combinations are allowed. The condition for the existence of Q-balls can be stated as the search for a non-vanishing minimum for the quantity:
\begin{equation}
E^2=\frac{2U}{\sum_{i} q_i|\Phi_i|^2}=\frac{2(U_D+U_{soft})}{\sum_{i} q_i|\Phi_i|^2}
\end{equation}
Notice that for small enough $\xi$ the point $\Phi_i=0$ is a minimum of the scalar potential $U$. But it is straightfoward to see that there is a nonvanishing minimum of $E$ above. To see this explicitly we can follow~\cite{Kusenko:1997ad} and consider the time dependent  $\Phi$ fields: $\Phi_i=\rho_i e^{iq_iwt}$ and use  `spherical' coordinates  with the overall radial coordinate $\rho^2=\sum_{i} q_i\rho_i^2=\sum_{i} q_i|\Phi_i|^2$. It is clear that the potential above is time-independent and quadratic in $\rho$ and then there is generically a minimum for $\rho\neq 0$ which is the condition for the existence of Q-balls. This argument applies to both flat directions from the observable sector (as it was argued for the MSSM in~\cite{Kusenko:1997ad}) but also for the $\Phi_i$ fields in a hidden sector coupled to the standard model fields only through gravitational interactions. The properties of the corresponding boson stars differ substantially: Q-balls from the observable sector have been considered to have important phenomenological implications, especially if they carry lepton or baryon number. Then they can play an important role for baryogenesis and constitute part of dark matter~\cite{Kusenko:1997si, Enqvist:2003gh}. 

Since global symmetries are rare in string models it may be easier to consider solutions for gauged symmetries (charged Q-balls). However there is a bound on the strength of the corresponding gauge coupling compared to gravity. Solutions tend to exist if gravity is stronger than the corresponding gauge interactions (see for instance~\cite{0801.0307, 1202.5809}). This may be in conflict with the weak gravity conjecture~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006dz} in string theory. In general the open string sector of string compactifications is the most model dependent  and it is difficult to establish model independent conclusions. However, even if non-topological solutions may not exist, the attractive nature of gravity makes it very generic that the corresponding boson star solutions will exist.

\subsection{PQ-balls}
\label{sec:PQBalls}

We consider now the possibility to have Q-ball like solution from the PQ shift-symmetry of closed string axions. This symmetry is usually broken by non-perturbative effects giving rise to non-trivial potentials for the corresponding axion field as we have discussed before. However, in special cases its breaking is hierarchically suppressed compared to the potential for the real part and it may be considered as a good approximate symmetry. This is the case in the LVS for the overall volume where the volume axion receives a potential which is doubly exponentially suppressed (i.e.~terms proportional to $e^{-a\tau}$ for which $\tau$ is itself exponentially large whereas the rest of the Lagrangian is only suppressed by powers of $1/\tau$).

In the general case of an exact PQ shift-symmetry for the axion we consider the two-fields system described by the following action
\begin{equation}
S = \int d^4 x\, \mathcal{L} = \int d^4x\, \left[- f(\tau) \left[\partial_\mu \tau \partial^\mu \tau + \partial_\mu \theta \partial^\mu \theta\right] - V(\tau)\right] \,,
\end{equation}
where the two fields can be identified as the real and imaginary parts of a complex modulus $T = \tau + i \theta$ and $f(\tau) = K_{T \overline{T}}$ is the second derivative of the \Kahler potential $K$\footnote{In the following we will leave the $\tau$-(or $\varphi$-)dependence understood in the functions $f(\tau)$ and $f(\varphi)$.}. In the following we take the standard assumption in a Q-ball analysis with a flat Minkowski metric, i.e.~neglecting gravitational effects, and we further assume that the potential $V(\tau)$ has a runaway to zero at $\tau\rightarrow \infty.$\footnote{The potential may also feature another minimum at finite $\tau$ as in LVS.} This runaway, in terms of the canonically normalised field $\varphi$, is assumed to be exponential which is precisely realised for the overall volume in the LVS. The action is then invariant under a PQ shift-symmetry, i.e.~a constant shift of the axion field
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ShiftSymmetry}
\theta \rightarrow \theta + \text{const.}
\end{equation}

The equation of motion for the axion field $\theta$ takes the current conservation form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ConservedCurrent}
\partial_\mu \left(f \partial^\mu \theta\right) \equiv \partial_\mu J^\mu = 0\,,
\end{equation}
where $J^\mu$ is a conserved current associated to the symmetry in eq.~\eqref{eq:ShiftSymmetry}. The conserved current and charge are then
\begin{equation}
J^\mu = f \partial^\mu \theta \,, \qquad Q = \int d^3x\, J^0 = \int d^3x\, f \dot\theta\,.
\end{equation}
Expanding eq.~\eqref{eq:ConservedCurrent} we get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EomTheta}
f \ddot\theta - f \nabla^2 \theta + f_\tau \dot\tau\dot\theta - f_\tau \nabla\tau\,\nabla\theta = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
while the equation of motion for $\tau$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EomTau}
2 f \ddot\tau + f_\tau \dot\tau^2 - 2 f \nabla^2 \tau - f_\tau \left(\nabla \tau\right)^2 + f_\tau \left(\nabla \theta\right)^2 - f_\tau \dot\theta^2  + \partial_\tau V = 0 \,.
\end{equation}

In the regime in which gravity is negligible we can consider the possibility that the PQ shift-symmetry can play a similar role as the U$(1)$ global symmetry in Coleman's Q-balls. After all, redefining the field $T$ in terms of $\Phi=e^{-T}$, the PQ shift-symmetry $T\to T+i\alpha$ becomes $\Phi\to e^{-i\alpha}\Phi$. as in the Q-balls case. However this field redefinition is not that straightforward as we will see now.

Formally, to extremise the energy keeping $Q$ constant we can consider the quantity:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 E_\omega & = & \int d^3x\left[ f(\tau)\left( \dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\tau}^2 + (\nabla\theta)^2+(\nabla\tau)^2\right) + V(\tau)\right] + 2 \omega\left(Q-\int d^3x \partial_0(f\theta)\right) = \nonumber \\
 & = &  \int d^3x\left[ f(\tau)\left( (\dot{\theta}-\omega)^2 + \dot{\tau}^2 + (\nabla\theta)^2+(\nabla\tau)^2\right) + \hat{V}(\tau) \right] + 2\omega Q \,.
 \end{eqnarray}
Here again $\omega$ starts as a Lagrange multiplier. The effective potential is now:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Vhat}
\hat{V}(\tau)=V(\tau) -\omega^2 f(\tau) \,,
\end{equation}
and the $\theta$-dependent terms are   minimised for:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\theta}=\omega\,,  \qquad \nabla{\theta}=0\,.
\end{equation}
Assuming a stationary solution in which $\dot{\tau}=0$. We arrive then at a similar situation as with Q-balls. A time dependence in the axion field $\theta$ that allows a time translation to be compensated by a constant PQ shift making all physical quantities time-independent.\\

We may try to extend the comparison noticing that for $f=\alpha/\tau^2$ and the original potential $V(\tau)$ vanishing at $\tau\to\infty$ we have that at this limit the charge and the potential vanish, similar to what happens at $\Phi=0$ in the Q-ball case.
 
Notice that $\dot{\theta}=\omega, \dot{\tau}=\nabla{\theta}=0$ automatically satisfy the equation of motion for $\theta$. The one for $\tau$  simplifies considerably if $\tau$ is represented in terms of the canonically normalised field $\varphi$ for which $\partial_\mu\varphi=\sqrt{2f} \partial_\mu \tau$. In this case the equation appears to be of the standard form:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\varphi - \partial_\varphi \hat{V}=0 \,,
\end{equation}
which in spherical coordinates can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\varphi{''}+\frac{2}{r}\varphi{'}-\partial_\varphi \hat{V}=0 \,.
\label{eqmotion}
\end{equation}
As usual, this leads to an equation equivalent to the motion of a particle in three dimensions under a potential $-\hat{V}$ with $r$ playing the role of time and the second term can be seen as a friction term. Assuming
\begin{equation}
f(\tau)=\frac{\alpha}{\tau^2}=\alpha e^{-\sqrt{2/\alpha}\, \varphi} \,,
\end{equation}
the potential (and  $\hat{V}$) vanishes asymptotically at $\varphi\to\infty$ corresponding to  decompactification (if $\tau$ determines the overall volume). This is the analogue of the $\Phi=0$ minimum for the Q-balls. At first sight the two systems look very similar. We can also notice that in the Q-balls case, the polar decomposition  $\Phi=\varphi e^{i\theta}$ is not appropriate at the minimum in which $\varphi=0$ since the kinetic term for $\theta$ is $\varphi^2(\partial\theta)^2$ which is singular at $\varphi=0$. Similar in the PQ case the kinetic term for the axionic $\theta$ field: $(\partial\theta)^2/\tau^2$ vanishes at $\tau\to \infty$. 

However, in the decompactification limit $\tau\to \infty$ an infinite number of degrees of freedom are excited and the effective 4D field theory is not the appropriate description. Even independent of this geometric interpretation the fact that all the derivatives of the potential vanish at this minimum renders this setup very different from the Q-balls case for which the second derivative is  already nonzero (mass).\\

Still, mathematically,  the overshoot/undershoot argument by Coleman can be used to look for a bounce solution of the scalar field equation as long as $\hat{V}$ has a finite minimum at negative $\hat{V}$ for which the analogue of the rolling particle in the inverted potential guarantees that there will be initial conditions such that the particle can start close to that minimum and end at $\infty$. The field profile would be increasing for $r\to \infty$, instead of vanishing and then there is no thin wall approximation. Depending on how fast the field increases with $r$ the charge $Q$ and energy $E$ may or may not be finite. The condition for a finite charge is that $r^2 f\to 0$ when $r\to \infty$. If $Q$ and $E$ were finite we may still claim a localised object interpretation,  otherwise the solution is not localised at least in four dimensions and a full ten-dimensional uplift of the solution would be needed. Furthermore the stability argument for Q-balls based on charge conservation and the fact that the Q-ball  is the configuration of minimal energy for a fixed charge is not clearly extended for PQ-balls since both quantities are not finite and there do not seem to be perturbative states charged under this symmetry.\\

For an exponential runaway behaviour of the potential $\hat{V}\sim  -\gamma e^{-b\varphi}$ (e.g. for large $\varphi$ the potential $\hat{V}$ is dominated by the $\omega^2 f(\tau)$ term with $b^2=2/\alpha$ and $\alpha\omega^2=\gamma$ ), then an asymptotic solution of eq.~\eqref{eqmotion} is:
\begin{equation}
\varphi=A+B\ln r + \dots \,,
\end{equation}
where $\dots$ denotes $\mathcal{O} (1/r)$ terms. For this $\partial_\varphi \hat{V} \sim  b\gamma e^{-b\varphi}$ and the constants $A,B$ can be determined by 
\begin{equation}
B=2/b, \qquad A=\frac{1}{b}\,\ln\left(\frac{\gamma b^2}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
and the charge density $f$ is proportional to $r^{-bB}=1/r^2$.  The total charge diverges proportionally to the radius
\begin{equation}
Q=\omega\int d^3x f(\tau) \propto  \int 4\pi r^2 dr \frac{\omega}{r^2}\to\infty \,.
\end{equation}
Similarly the total energy would be dominated  by the $\omega^2 f$ term and would also diverge. However, both charge and energy density are finite at finite $r$ and decrease asymptotically as $1/r^2$, while their ratio is proportional to $\omega$.\\

Notice that the charge of this solution is an axionic charge and can be written in terms of its dual field in four-dimensions, an antisymmetric tensor $B_{\mu\nu}$. Roughly, $f\partial_\mu\theta=\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\partial_{\nu} B_{\rho\sigma}$ and so:
\begin{equation}
Q=\int d^3x f\dot{\theta}\propto \int d^3x\, \epsilon_{ijk}H_{ijk} \,,
\end{equation}
where $i,j,k$ denote spatial indices and $H=dB.$ Spherical symmetry implies that $B$ depends only on $r$. This expression is of the standard RR-flux. In fact recall that for the volume modulus the corresponding axion comes from the RR-field $C_{MNPQ}$ and the $B$ field is essentially $B_{\mu\nu}=C_{\mu\nu mn} J_{mn}$ with $m,n$ internal indices and $J_{mn}$ the canonical two-form for Calabi-Yau spaces. From these expressions it is natural to identify the PQ-ball charge as a flux from the ten-dimensional theory. Notice that the PQ-ball charge is similar to the  charge of axionic black holes~\cite{Bowick:1988xh} for which $H$ is exact and $Q=\int_{S^2} B$.\\

Besides the decompactification minimum, if the original scalar  potential ($\omega=0$) also has a second minimum, corresponding to a four-dimensional spacetime, we may also consider the possibility for `transitions' from the $\omega\neq 0 $ minimum of $\hat{V}$ and the finite $\tau$ minimum of $V(\tau)$. We consider for simplicity the following potential
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}(\varphi) = a_1 e^{-5 \varphi} - a_2 e^{-4 \varphi} + a_3 e^{-3 \varphi} - \omega^2 e^{-2 \varphi} \,,
\end{equation}
where the last term come from $\omega^2 f$ in eq. \eqref{eq:Vhat} with $\alpha=1/2$. It is possible to impose that such a potential has a vanishing energy stationary point in $\varphi_0$ requiring $V(\varphi_0) = V'(\varphi_0) = 0$, that translates into two requirements for the coefficients
\begin{equation}
a_2 = \omega^2 e^{2 \varphi_0} + 2 a_1 e^{-\varphi_0}  \,, \qquad a_3 = 2 \omega^2 e^{\varphi_0} + a_1 e^{-2 \varphi_0} \,.
\end{equation}
Requiring that $\varphi_0$ is also a minimum leads to another condition on $a_1$. For all purposes of the subsequent discussion we take $\varphi_0 = 5$ and $a_1 = 10^4$ that ensure that $\varphi_0$ is a minimum. Varying the value of $\omega$ leads to a modification of the potential that feature a second AdS minimum, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ModifiedPotential}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{ModifiedPotential.pdf}
\caption{Modified potential $\hat{V}$ for different values of the constant $\omega$.}
\label{fig:ModifiedPotential}
\end{figure}
Classical paths can be found connecting these two points which would correspond to symmetry breaking points in the Q-balls case. We solve the bounce equation in eq. \eqref{eqmotion} for the case $\omega = 0.025$ (see left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:Bounce} for the inverted potential) and we get a thick-wall solution as shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:Bounce}\footnote{The radial distance in the plot of the solution is given in units of the fake mass around the fake minimum (at $\varphi \simeq 5.3$) of the inverted potential in the left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:Bounce}, that sets the natural timescale.}. Notice that from the inverted potential it is possible to start from the new minimum to either the (shifted) compactified vacuum or to the decompactified vacuum at infinity. Clearly, the total charge is infinite in this case also.\\

\begin{figure}
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=7.8cm]{InvertedPotential.pdf}}
\hfill
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=7.cm]{Bounce.pdf}}
\caption{\textit{Left panel}: Inverted potential in the case $\omega=0.025$. The two minima become two maxima and the bounce solution corresponds to the classical motion of a point particle that starts close to the larger maximum and stops exactly in the lower maximum. The effective mass computed around the fake minimum in $\varphi \simeq 5.3$ sets the timescale for such classical motion and hence also the natural spatial scale for the radius of the bounce solution plotted in the right panel. \textit{Right panel:} bounce solution interpolating between the fake AdS vacuum and the Minkowski vacuum of the modified potential for $\omega = 0.025$. The red dashed line represents the position of the Minkowski minimum.}
\label{fig:Bounce}
\end{figure}

 
We have seen that the PQ-balls solutions are mathematically very similar to the original Q-balls, however they have different physical properties. In particular the fact that Q-balls correspond to the minimum energy configurations for a fixed charge $Q$ does not extend to the PQ-balls case since the total charge is infinite.  Once gravity is included we can simply see them as extensions  of the $\omega=0$ case discussed above for the volume modulus to arbitrary values of $\omega$. Gravity, rather than the properties of the symmetric potential provides the attractive force to generate the boson star solutions.

\section{Formation Mechanisms}
\label{sec:formationall}

In Sec.~\ref{sec:StringCOs} we have pointed out that moduli potentials support many different types of compact objects. However, whether they are actually formed during the history of the Universe is a different question. The formation of compact objects typically requires that the following two conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item[I)] There is some initial localized overdensity;
\item[II)] The initial overdensity collapses due to the effect of attractive interactions.
\end{itemize}
Typical examples include the formation of (pseudo-)solitonic objects like Q-balls or oscillons and the formation of structures in the Universe. Following these two examples we can schematically distinguish between two different classes of formation mechanisms, depending on whether gravity plays a crucial role in the realisation of the above conditions. In this section we will mainly discuss condition I).\\

Condition I) can be achieved immediately after inflation, if there is a quick amplification of the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton (or any other scalar field) that is oscillating around the minimum of its potential~\cite{Amin:2014eta}. As we previously reviewed in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz} there are two main mechanisms for the amplification of the quantum fluctuations for an oscillating scalar field, i.e.~parametric resonance and tachyonic oscillations. As the timescale for these amplifications is typically short, gravity can be neglected during the amplification of these fluctuations. A further possibility is that quantum fluctuations are amplified as the field is rapidly spinning in a U$(1)$ symmetric potential, as described in~\cite{Boyle:2001du}\footnote{The growth of fluctuations in spintessence models can take place even in the absence of gravity, as shown in~\cite{Kasuya:2001pr}.}. In Section~\ref{sec:SpinningAxion} we will show that even if there is no U$(1)$ symmetry, this mechanism could still work for a modulus-axion system, provided that the axionic direction is flat and that the field is spinning at constant speed. \\

A possible alternative to get large initial overdensities is through phase transitions in the early Universe. As briefly reviewed at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:bosonstarsinfieldtheory} the typical example is a scenario in which the PQ U$(1)$ symmetry breaking takes place after inflation: in this case the field resides in a different vacuum in different regions of the Universe, so that the overdensities are typically large to start with. Numerical simulations have shown that they can lead to the formation of axion miniclusters~\cite{Hogan:1988mp, Kolb:1993zz, Kolb:1993hw, Enander:2017ogx}. An alternative mechanism that could be at work even if the PQ U$(1)$ symmetry is broken before the end of inflation employs a first order phase transition in the sector that generates the axion mass~\cite{Hardy:2016mns}. Despite these mechanisms can be very efficient, they are obviously model-dependent.\\

If gravity is negligible the collapse of the overdensities, i.e.~condition II), can take place due to the attractive self-interaction of the scalar field. The requirement that the self-interaction is attractive translates into the condition that the scalar potential has to be shallower than quadratic~\cite{Amin:2013ika}. The formation of (pseudo-)solitonic objects like Q-balls and oscillons has been intensively studied with the help of lattice codes~\cite{Amin:2013ika, Amin:2010jq, Amin:2010dc, Amin:2011hj, Lozanov:2014zfa, Antusch:2015vna, Antusch:2015ziz, Antusch:2016con}. We already numerically studied the formation of oscillons in string models in~\cite{Antusch:2017flz}. We would like to highlight that in this case the formation of compact objects depends crucially on the choice of the initial conditions of the background scalar field. If the field is the inflaton, the initial conditions are fixed by the inflationary evolution. However, if the field is a modulus displaced during inflation, the Hubble friction provided by the thermal bath that dominates the energy density between the decay of the inflaton and the early phase of matter domination would typically damp the background field very quickly, making the mechanism for the amplification of fluctuations much less efficient.\\

The effects of gravity could provide an alternative way to get large overdensities from the initial scalar perturbations (seeded e.g.~during inflation), as in the case of structure formation. When the overdensities are of order unity, the same gravity could provide the attractive interaction that makes them collapse and produce the large structures that we currently observe in the Universe~\cite{Gorbunov:2011zzc}. In Section~\ref{sec:EarlyMatterEra} we point out that string moduli typically satisfy requirement I) for the formation of compact structures even in the cases of potentials (or initial conditions) that do not support tachyonic oscillations, parametric resonance, spinning axion solutions or phase transitions. Similar results have already been obtained in the past in~\cite{Khlopov:1985jw, 0805.1748, Cembranos:2015oya, Hidalgo:2017dfp}. The fulfillment of condition II) requires detailed and model-dependent numerical studies of the non-linear evolution of the overdensities including the effects of gravity. We are performing such analyses in the case of the moduli stars described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ModuliStars} and we will report these results in forthcoming publications. Similar aspects of early structure formation have already been studied in a few papers. In~\cite{Easther:2010mr, Jedamzik:2010dq}  the authors focused on an early matter era caused by the inflaton, in~\cite{Assadullahi:2009nf} the authors focused on the GW production due to an early matter era and in~\cite{Erickcek:2011us} the authors studied the formation of small compact minihalos due to the presence of an early matter era (possibly detectable by LISA). These papers show, in the light of the discovery of GWs, how promising the study of this early matter domination era can be.

\subsection{Spinning Axion}
\label{sec:SpinningAxion}

In this section we extend the previous discussion on the effects of the mixing kinetic terms between the volume modulus and its axionic partner to other cosmological implications apparently independent of boson stars. As we will observe at the end of the section the spinning axion scenario could be an interesting option to trigger the growth of fluctuations, that eventually could clump and form compact objects.\\

We work in Newtonian gauge
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = - \left(1+2 \phi\right)  dt^2 + a^2 \left(1-2\phi\right) \mathbf{dx}^2 \,,
\end{equation}
The action is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ActionSpintessence}
\mathcal{S} = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \mathcal{L} = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \left[-f g^{\mu \nu} \left(\partial_\mu \tau \partial_\nu \tau + \partial_\mu \theta \partial_\nu \theta\right) - V(\tau)\right] \,.
\end{equation}
Canonically normalizing the radial field $\tau$:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{2 f} d \tau = d \varphi \,,
\end{equation}
the action reduces to
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \left[-g^{\mu \nu} \left(\partial_\mu \varphi \partial_\nu \varphi + f(\varphi) \partial_\mu \theta \partial_\nu \theta\right) - V\right] \,.
\end{equation}
As discussed before, this generalises the case for a U$(1)$ invariant Lagrangian for a complex field for which the kinetic term is $f(\varphi)=\varphi^2$. For the case of string moduli we will use
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FModuli}
f=\alpha/\tau^2=\alpha e^{-\sqrt{2/\alpha}\varphi} \,.
\end{equation}
This kinetic mixing can have other implications. In particular the proposal of `spintessence' \cite{Boyle:2001du} relies on this kinetic mixing for the U$(1)$ case. The idea is that (as for Q-balls)  the phase of $\varphi$ is linear in time and its  kinetic term  provides an extra term to the equation for the modulus of $\varphi$. This spinning of the scalar field modifies substantially the equation of state and therefore the cosmological implications of $\varphi$. We may wonder if a similar situation happens for the closed string moduli with an approximate shift-symmetry for the axionic component allowing a linear time-dependence of the axion field which may be denoted 'spinning axion'.
The equations of motion are
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EOMtau}
- f_\tau g^{\mu \nu} \left(\partial_\mu \tau \partial_\nu \tau + \partial_\mu \theta \partial_\nu \theta\right) + \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\mu \left(\sqrt{-g} f g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\nu \tau\right) - \partial_\tau V = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EOMTheta}
\partial_\mu \left(\sqrt{-g} f g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\nu \theta\right) = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
The last equation is in the form of a conservation law, with current $J^\mu = \sqrt{-g} f g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\nu \theta$, from which we can define a conserved charge
\begin{equation}
Q = - \int d^3x\, \sqrt{-g} g^{00} f \dot\theta \equiv q \, \text{Vol} \,,
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the charge density defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ChargeDensity}
q = 2 f a^3 \dot\theta \,,
\end{equation}
and $\text{Vol} = \int d^3x \sqrt{-g}$. Taking just the homogeneous part of the field $\tau$ we get the following equation of motion
\begin{equation}
\ddot\tau + \frac{\partial_\tau f}{2 f} \dot\tau^2 + 3 H \dot\tau + \frac{\partial_\tau V}{2 f} - \frac{q^2}{8 a^6} \frac{\partial_\tau f}{f^3} = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
A spintessence-like solution is obtained if there is a regime in which the first three terms in this equation of motion are negligible, such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SpintessenceConstraint}
\frac{\partial_\tau V}{2 f} = \frac{q^2}{8 a^6} \frac{\partial_\tau f}{f^3} \,.
\end{equation}
Notice that for the $f$ in eq. \eqref{eq:FModuli} (of for any $f \propto \tau^{-y}$ with $y > 0$), $\partial_\tau f < 0$ and in order to satisfy eq.~\eqref{eq:SpintessenceConstraint} the classical field has to lie in the $\partial_\tau V < 0$ region of the potential. 

In terms of the canonically normalized homogeneous field $\varphi$ defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha} d\tau}{\tau} = \frac{d \varphi}{\sqrt{2}} \,,\qquad  \tau=e^{\frac{\varphi}{\sqrt{2\alpha}}} \,,
\end{equation}
the equation of motion for the homogeneous field can be written as
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\varphi}+3H\dot{\varphi}+\partial_{\varphi} V=\frac{q^2\partial_\varphi f}{4 a^6 f^2} \,.
\label{FieldEvolution}
\end{equation}

To illustrate matters let us take the  simple  run-away potential and gauge kinetic function:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RunAwayPotential}
V =V_0  \,e^{-\kappa_1\varphi} \,, \qquad f=\alpha\, e^{-\kappa_2\varphi} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have redefined $\kappa_2 = \sqrt{2/\alpha}$ for later convenience. Contrary to what happens to the $|\Phi|^n$ potential  for the complex field $\Phi$ in spintessence, the first two terms in eq.~\eqref{FieldEvolution} are not directly negligible for the exponential potential since for a constant equation of state all terms in this equation scale as $1/t^2$. The explicit solution with constant equation of state and `charge' $q$ is 

\begin{equation}
\varphi(t)=B\, \ln t - C\,, \qquad a(t)=t^{\frac{\kappa_1+\kappa_2}{3\kappa_1}} 
\end{equation}
with $B,C$ and $q$ related by:

\begin{equation}
B=\frac{2}{\kappa_1}\,, \qquad   q^2\, =\, \frac{4\kappa_1 V_0}{\kappa_2}\, e^{(\kappa_1+\kappa_2)C}\, -\,  \frac{8}{\kappa_1^2}\,  e^{\kappa_2 C}\,,
\end{equation}
and the equation of state is
\begin{equation}
w(\varphi) = \frac{\kappa_1-\kappa_2}{\kappa_1 +\kappa_ 2} \,.
\end{equation}
This is  similar to the  equation of state  for an oscillating field with  potential $V=|\Phi|^n$~\cite{0805.1748} for which the time average $\langle w\rangle=(n-2)/(n+2)$. But in our case the result holds without the time average.\\

Notice that the term coming from the kinetic mixing is crucial for this solution to exist since there is no way to satisfy the relations above for $q=\kappa_2=0$. Furthermore, the first two terms in eq.~\eqref{FieldEvolution} can be neglected even though they have the same time dependence of the other two as long as $q^2\gg 1$ and $C,\kappa_1,\kappa_2>0$.  Notice also that $\kappa_1=\kappa_2$ leads to matter domination ($w = 0$) whereas $\kappa_1=2\kappa_2$ gives radiation domination ($w = 1/3$). Also the limit $\kappa_1\gg \kappa_2$ gives kinetic domination ($w \rightarrow 1$) and $\kappa_2 \gg \kappa_1$ leads to dark energy domination ($w \rightarrow -1$).\\
 
It has not escaped our notice that this runaway potential, once dressed with the kinetic contribution from $\theta$, leads to an effective potential (in flat spacetime ($a(t)$=constant)):
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm eff} = V+ \frac{q^2}{4f} \,,
\end{equation}
 which, unlike the runaway $V$ above, has a minimum. Therefore kinetic axion terms can stabilise the real part of the modulus field. In particular  flux compactifications of IIB string theory lead to a no-scale flat potential at tree level but with a runaway potential for negative Euler with $\alpha=3/4$ and $\kappa=9/2$ leading to a minimum for $\tau\propto q^{-4/13}$ which is in the effective field theory regime for $q\ll 1$. Notice, however, that since the equation of state is not standard even though the minimum is at non zero vacuum energy this does not correspond to $w=-1$.\\
 
We have also investigated the stability of such solution following the procedure of~\cite{Boyle:2001du, Kasuya:2001pr}. To make the equations cleaner, we neglect gravity in the study of the evolutions of perturbations, setting $\phi = 0$. It has been shown that the conclusions should not change by including gravity in the discussion~\cite{Boyle:2001du}. We can compute the equations of motion for the perturbations using
\begin{equation}
\varphi = \varphi_0 + \delta \varphi \,, \qquad \theta = \theta_0 + \delta \theta \,.
\end{equation}
Denoting $f_0 = \alpha \, e^{-\kappa_2 \varphi_0}$, we get respectively
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EOMdeltavarphi}
\delta \ddot\varphi + 3 H \delta \dot\varphi - \kappa_2^2 \, f_0 \dot\theta_0^2 \delta \varphi - \frac{\nabla^2}{a^2} \delta \varphi + 2 \kappa_2 \, f_0 \dot\theta_0 \delta \dot\theta + V'' \delta \varphi = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EOMdeltatheta}
\delta \ddot\theta + 3 H \delta \dot \theta - \frac{\nabla^2}{a^2} \delta \theta - \kappa_2 \, \dot\varphi_0 \delta \dot\theta - \kappa_2 \, \dot\theta_0 \delta \dot\varphi = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
where $V'' = \partial_\varphi \partial_\varphi V$.\\

It is possible to study the stability of the system against perturbations by just using the ansatz
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FlucAnsatz}
\delta \varphi = \delta \varphi_0 \, e^{\Omega t + i \mathbf{k \cdot x}} \,, \quad \delta \theta = \delta \theta_0\, e^{\Omega t + i \mathbf{k \cdot x}} \,.
\end{equation}
Plugging this ansatz in eq.s~\eqref{eq:EOMdeltavarphi} and~\eqref{eq:EOMdeltatheta}, working in Fourier space and using that $a H \ll k$ and that $\varphi_0$ varies slowly we get a quadratic equation in $\Omega$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OmegaEquation}
\Omega^4 + \Omega^2 \left[2 \frac{k^2}{a^2} + V'' + \kappa_2^2 f_0 \,\dot\theta_0^2\right] + \frac{k^2}{a^2} \left(\frac{k^2}{a^2} + V'' - \kappa_2^2 f_0\, \dot\theta_0^2\right) = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
The fluctuations in eq.~\eqref{eq:FlucAnsatz} grow if $\Omega$ is real and positive, which is ensured if the last term in eq.~\eqref{eq:OmegaEquation} is negative, i.e.~for modes that satisfy
\begin{equation}
0 < \frac{k^2}{a^2} < \frac{k_{\rm J}^2}{a^2} \equiv \kappa_2^2 f_0 \, \dot\theta_0^2 - V'' \,,
\end{equation}
where $k_{\rm J}$ is the Jeans mode that can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\frac{k_{\rm J}^2}{a^2} = \frac{\kappa_2^2\, q^2}{4 f_0 a^6} - V'' \,.
\end{equation}
As in string models we expect $V''$ to be positive, the existence of such an instability band has to be checked on a case by case basis. For instance, if we assume that the potential is dominated by the run away potential in eq.~\eqref{eq:RunAwayPotential} in the region where the motion of the field $\varphi_0$ is taking place, then the Jeans mode becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{k_{\rm J}^2}{a^2} = \frac{\kappa_2^4 \, q^2}{8 a^6} e^{\kappa_2 \varphi_0} - V_0 e^{-\kappa_1 \varphi_0} \,,
\end{equation}
that, depending on the parameters of the model can stay positive for some time (despite the $a^{-6}$ suppression in the first term), leading to a significant growth of the fluctuations. Let us stress that we neglected gravity in the stability analysis, but it is expected that its inclusion would not change the conclusion, as it happens in the original spintessence model~\cite{Boyle:2001du}. If the spinning axion field has to provide dark matter (that could be the case if $\kappa_1 = \kappa_2$), one should explicitly check that the Jeans length is such that it allows the formation of large scale structures in agreement with observation. We leave a detailed scan of the potentials for which the spinning axion provides a good dark matter candidate for the future. Moreover, the growth of the fluctuations can lead to the formation of non-topological solitons. Unlike the case of spintessence, Q-balls cannot form, due to the absence of an unbroken U$(1)$ vacuum. However, oscillons can be formed if the potential in the radial direction has a minimum and it is shallower than quadratic around it.

\subsection{Early matter era}
\label{sec:EarlyMatterEra}

In this section we point out that the requirement I) at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:formationall} is generically satisfied by string models before the beginning of BBN. The main observation relevant to this section is that during matter domination sub-horizon matter density perturbations modes $\delta_{\rm m,k}$ grow linearly with the scale factor\footnote{In terms of conformal time $\delta_{\rm m,k} \propto \tau^2$. The reader should not confuse conformal time $\tau$ with moduli.}
\begin{equation} 
\delta_{\rm m,k} \equiv \frac{\delta \rho_{\rm m,k}}{\langle \rho \rangle} \propto a(t) \sim t^{2/3} \,, \qquad k \gg a H \,.
\end{equation}
Since an oscillating modulus can be well described as pressureless dust, a growth of the matter perturbations is expected also during the early matter domination prior to BBN\footnote{A modulus driven early matter era generically leads to a rich phenomenology, see~\cite{Kane:2015jia, Acharya:2008bk, Acharya:2009zt, Acharya:2010af, Aparicio:2015sda, Aparicio:2016qqb, Allahverdi:2013noa, Allahverdi:2016yws}.}. Density perturbations can roughly grow as much as
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \frac{\delta_{\rm m,k}(t_{\rm dec})}{\delta_{\rm m,k}(t_{\rm mat})} \approx \left(\frac{t_{\rm dec}}{t_{\rm mat}}\right)^{2/3} \approx \left(\frac{H_{\rm mat}}{H_{\rm dec}}\right)^{2/3} \approx \left(\frac{m}{\Gamma}\right)^{2/3} \approx \left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{m}\right)^{4/3} \,,
\end{equation}
where the subscripts \textit{dec} and \textit{mat} denote the modulus decay time and the moment at which the early matter domination starts.  We used that during matter domination $H \propto t^{-1}$, that the modulus starts oscillating when $H_{\rm mat} \sim m$ and that the decay rate is $\Gamma \simeq m^3/M_{\rm P}^2$ for a gravitationally coupled modulus. In the case of the volume modulus the enhancement can then be as large as
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \left.\frac{\delta_{\rm m,k}(\tau_{\rm dec})}{\delta_{\rm m,k}(\tau_{\rm mat})}\right|_{{V}}  \approx \left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{M_{\rm P}/{V}^{3/2}}\right)^{4/3} = {V}^2 \,,
\end{equation}
since the volume modulus mass is $m \simeq M_{\rm P}/{{V}^{3/2}}$. For the blow-up moduli the maximum enhancement is $\Psi \simeq {V}^{4/3}$, for fibre moduli $\Psi \simeq {V}^{20/9}$ while for KKLT is $\Psi \simeq \left(\frac{M_{\rm P} {V}}{|W_0|}\right)^{4/3}$. The maximum enhancement comes independently of the value of $\mathcal{V}$ or $W_0$ from requiring that $m \gtrsim 100 \, \text{TeV}$, in order to avoid the cosmological moduli problem. Such bound still gives a huge possible enhancement~\cite{Assadullahi:2009nf}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MaxEnhancement}
\Psi_{\rm max} \simeq 10^{20}\,.
\end{equation}
This behaviour can be easily checked numerically by solving the linearized evolution equations for scalar perturbations in Newtonian gauge~\cite{Mukhanov:1990me} derived from general relativity. The energy density of the Universe is initially dominated by a thermal bath\footnote{In the numerics we chose $\rho_{\rm radiation} = 10^4 \, \rho_{\varphi} \gg \rho_{\varphi}$ (where $\rho_{\varphi}$ is the energy density stored in the displaced scalar field) at the initial time.}, while a scalar field is displaced from its minimum\footnote{We consider a quadratic potential: including corrections to the quadratic potential slightly changes only the transient evolution of the perturbations.} and stuck due to Hubble friction. In Figure~\ref{fig:InterestingModes} we show the evolution of the comoving horizon $a H$ and of the comoving Jeans mode\footnote{$\tilde\tau$ and $k$ are in units of the mass of the field $m$.} $k_{\rm J} = a \sqrt{m H}$~\cite{Gorbunov:2011zzc}. All the matter overdensity modes $k$ that enter the horizon (i.e.~$k > a H$) and such that $k < k_{\rm J}$, grow like the one shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:OverD}, where we show the evolution of $\delta_{\rm m,k}$ for a mode ($k = 1$) that enters the horizon immediately after the beginning of the evolution. After an initial brief transient in which the Universe is going from being radiation dominated to being matter dominated, the overdensity starts growing linearly with the scale factor. In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:OverD} we show the corresponding Newtonian potential, that tends to a constant in the matter dominated era, as expected. Finally, radiation perturbations oscillate around the constant value of $\phi$.\\

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{InterestingModes.pdf}
\caption{Evolution of the comoving horizon $a H$ (black) and of the comoving Jeans mode $k_{\rm J}$ (dashed red). The green dotted line represents the relation between $k$ and $\tilde{\tau}$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:TauHE}. The horizontal and vertical lines correspond to $k_{\rm mat}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{\rm mat}$ respectively.}
\label{fig:InterestingModes}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=7.cm]{Overdensity.png}}
\hfill
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{PhiK1.pdf}}
\caption{\textit{Left panel}: Overdensity for the mode $k=1$ normalized by the scale factor $\delta_{\text{m,k}}/a(\tilde{\tau})$, in log scale.

We use arbitrary units on the y-axis. \textit{Right panel}: Newtonian potential for the mode $k=1$. The initial value is normalized to $\phi_k = -1$. As expected during matter domination the Newtonian potential tends to a constant value.}
\label{fig:OverD}
\end{figure}

It is possible to get an analytical solution for modes that are still superhorizon while the Universe is already matter dominated\footnote{In the numerics we adapted the discussion below to take into account that the Universe is initially radiation dominated, hence $w = 1/3$.}. The initial conditions needed to solve the linearized equations can be found using the relation between the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ and the Newtonian potential $\phi$\footnote{In the approximation of constant equation of state $w$.} for modes that are superhorizon
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RelationCurvaturePotential}
\mathcal{R}_k \simeq - \frac{5 + 3 w}{3 + 3 w} \phi_k \,.
\end{equation}
We can set the initial conditions directly in the matter dominated phase ($w=0$) so that for super-horizon modes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SHModes}
\delta_{\text{m},k} \approx- 2 \phi_k = \frac{6}{5} \mathcal{R}_k \,.
\end{equation}
Assuming a flat spectrum of perturbations from inflation
\begin{equation}\Delta_{\mathcal{R}}^2 (k) = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} \left|\mathcal{R}_k\right|^2\simeq 2.4 \times 10^{-9} \,,
\end{equation}
and from eq. \eqref{eq:SHModes} the initial condition at horizon re-entry of the $k$ mode $\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k)$ is
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\text{m},k}^0 \equiv \delta_{\text{m},k} (\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k)) \simeq \left(3 \times 10^{-9}\right)^{1/2} \,.
\end{equation}
and the evolution of $\delta_{\text{m},k}$ after horizon re-entry is
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\text{m},k} (\tilde\tau) = \delta_{\text{m},k}^0 \left(\frac{\tilde\tau}{\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k)}\right)^2 \,.
\end{equation}
$\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k)$ can be computed by noting that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HE}
\frac{k}{a(\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k))} = H(\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k)) \,.
\end{equation}
Denoting by $\tilde\tau_{\rm mat}$ the conformal time at the start of matter domination (i.e.~when the scale factor starts evolving as $a(\tilde\tau) \simeq \tilde\tau^2$), from eq.~\eqref{eq:HE} and using that during matter domination $a(\tilde\tau) \propto \tilde\tau^2$ and that $H = a'/a^2$, we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TauHE}
\tilde\tau_{\rm HE}(k) = \frac{k_{\rm mat} \tilde\tau_{\rm mat}}{k} \,.
\end{equation}
For the example at hand we numerically find $\tilde\tau_{\rm mat} \simeq 6$ and $\log_{10} \left(k_{\rm mat}\right) = 0.34$, see Fig. \ref{fig:InterestingModes}. The typical size of the density constrast fluctuations on a comoving scale $k^{-1}$ can be written as the square root of the variance of the density perturbations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SpaceVariance}
\delta_{k^{-1}}^2 \simeq \langle \delta(\mathbf{x}) \delta(\mathbf{x}) \rangle = \int_0^k d \log q \, \frac{q^3}{2 \pi^2} \left|\delta_{\text{m},q}\right|^2 = \frac{\left(\delta_{\text{m},k}^0\right)^2}{2 \pi^2} \left(\frac{\tilde\tau}{\tilde\tau_{\rm mat}}\right)^4 \int_0^k \frac{dq}{k_{\rm mat}} \left(\frac{q}{k_{\rm mat}}\right)^3\,,
\end{equation}
from which the requirement that fluctuations go non-linear on a comoving scale $k^{-1}$ (with $k \ll k_{\rm mat}$) can be related to a requirement on $\tilde\tau/\tilde\tau_{\rm mat}$. For instance if we take as the upper limit of integration $k = k_{\rm mat}/10$, the integral gives a factor $0.25 \times 10^{-4}$ and the requirement on $\tilde\tau/\tilde\tau_{\rm mat}$ in order for $\delta^2_{k^{-1}}$ to go non-linear is
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\tilde\tau) = \left(\frac{\tilde\tau}{\tilde\tau_{\rm mat}}\right)^2 \gtrsim \left(\frac{8 \pi^2}{3} \times 10^{13}\right)^{1/2} \simeq 1.6 \times 10^7 \ll \Psi_{\rm max} \,.
\end{equation}
This analytical estimate takes into account modes $k \ll k_{\rm mat}$ and it is enough to show that in general it is quite hard to avoid some scales to become non-linear. Of course, modes $k \simeq k_{\rm mat}$ go non-linear much earlier. Assuming a flat spectrum of fluctuations as initial conditions $\Delta_{\mathcal{R}}^2(k) \simeq 2 \times 10^{-9}$, scales around $k_{\rm mat}$ (for which the result of the integral in eq. \eqref{eq:SpaceVariance} is of $\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$) go non-linear as long as the mass of the gravitationally coupled modulus satisfies
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EnhConstraint}
10^{-9} \left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{m}\right)^{8/3} \gtrsim 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-4} \, M_{\rm P} \,, \quad \Rightarrow \quad {V} \gtrsim 10^3 \,,
\end{equation}
which is a rather weak constraint\footnote{The last implication of eq. \eqref{eq:EnhConstraint} is computed for the LVS volume modulus, for which $m \simeq M_{\rm P}/{V}^{3/2}$.}. Once the fluctuations satisfy $\delta_{k^{-1}} \simeq 1$ on a given comoving scale $k^{-1}$, the linear analysis breaks down and a fully non-linear simulation that includes the effects of gravity is needed. The implication is rather strong: the existence of a scalar field like the volume modulus in the LVS always implies that non-linear physics has to be taken into account. A more detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work. However, it is reasonable to expect that once fluctuations go non-linear the formation of compact structures (such as moduli stars or primordial black holes) could start~\cite{Jedamzik:2010dq}. The formation of primordial black holes through this mechanism could be particularly interesting for subsequent evolution of the Universe. Since they would be extremely light, they would evaporate very quickly providing for instance the initial conditions needed for instance for \textit{Hawking genesis}~\cite{Lennon:2017tqq}. Moreover, even if they do not form compact objects, such non-linearities could still give rise to a stochastic background of gravitational radiation, as pointed out in~\cite{Assadullahi:2009nf}.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

We have started a systematic study and  found the first concrete examples of boson stars in string compactifications. Both hidden and visible open string sectors essentially reproduce the previous field theoretical studies regarding Q-balls and boson stars, taking into account that the appearance of global symmetries is very restrictive in string theory. Closed string moduli offered a more stringy realisation of boson stars with particular properties that may be eventually identified and compared with observations. Concrete scenarios of moduli stabilisation such as the LVS or KKLT provide different examples of boson stars with different properties. Even though in the boson stars literature the case of boson stars with masses $M_{\rm P}^3/m^2$ are much studied we find that they are not naturally realised in the closed string sector for which only the original mini-boson stars of mass $M_{\rm P}^2/m$ are obtained. This is due to the fact that the particularly strong self-interactions are not obtained since all terms in the moduli interactions come from the string scale and coefficients are not many orders of magnitude larger than one, as it would be needed to get boson stars with masses $M_{\rm P}^3/m^2$. 

Axion stars are one of the most promising and generic outcomes of string compactifications. Different axionic particles provide different sources of axion stars. Typically axions obtain masses of the same order as their moduli partners and can give rise to light microscopic stars. However the large volume scenario predicts that there is at least one axion field with mass of order $m\sim e^{-\alpha\mathcal{V}^{2/3}}$ and therefore the corresponding stars have exponentially large masses $M\sim e^{\alpha \mathcal{V}^{2/3}}$ in Planck units. If the mass of this light axion is in the right ballpark ($1\text{-}10 \times 10^{-22} \,$ eV) it can be fuzzy dark matter. In this case, an axion star would form at the core of dwarf galaxies possibly addressing the cusp-core problem of cold dark matter. A similar situation occurs for any other string modulus which is stabilised by perturbative effects: its axionic partner would be the source of macroscopic stars.

Even though axion stars have been very much studied in the  literature independent of string theory, in string theory the corresponding scalar modulus field can also be a source for moduli stars. Since they are components of a complex scalar field together with an axion, in string theory both fields should be considered together. If they are both of similar masses they have to be considered together with the corresponding axion. In the small amplitude regime the two fields oscillate independently and their effect is simple to consider. But in other regimes the two-field system needs to be considered. This we will leave for a future study.





The moduli stars we considered vary if the corresponding field is the overall modulus, a blow-up mode or a fibre modulus. In each case the star mass is of order $M_{\rm P} \mathcal{V}^{n}$ with $n=1, 3/2, 5/3$ respectively. In the KKLT case the star mass is $M_{\rm P} |W_0|^{-1}\mathcal{V}.$ We determined the field profile and the mass-radius behaviour for each case in the dilute regime\footnote{The relation of the mass of the object with the inverse mass of the corresponding particle is reminiscent of the fact that in gauge theories elementary particles have masses proportional to couplings and that of the solitonic objects to powers of the inverse couplings. This played a role in uncovering strong-weak dualities in field and string theories. In our case the interaction is gravity and for moduli stars the relation corresponds to inverse powers of the volume as can be seen in Tab.~\ref{tab:summary}.}. A summary of the configurations obtained in this article can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:summary} and a summary of expected mass ranges and radii for typically considered values of the overall volume and flux parameter are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:massvsradiussummary}.

Similarly studying the formation of these objects we pointed out that the first condition listed at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:formationall} (i.e.~the existence of a localized overdensity) is always satisfied independently of the initial conditions and of the details of the model. The enhancement of the density perturbations takes place if there is an early matter dominated era due to an oscillating modulus. In the examined cases the enhancement is of order $\mathcal{V}^l$ with $l=4/3, 2, 20/9$ respectively, illustrating concrete physical differences between the different objects.

We have also studied the interesting limiting case in which an axion is so light that the PQ shift-symmetry can be considered exact for the study of the physics of the associated modulus field.
This case resembles the Q-ball case for a complex scalar. We call the corresponding configurations PQ-balls and started to study their properties. Even though they do not provide localised solitonic configurations in 4D they extend the solutions for a single modulus field to non-zero values of the angular velocity of the axionic component. This spinning axion configurations also generalises the spintessence proposal with potential cosmological implications which we hope to further study in the future.

Potential signatures of this study hints naturally at GWs. First, independently of the formation of boson stars, the substantial enhancement of density perturbations during an early matter dominated era (up to factors of order $10^{20}$) can lead to the production of a stochastic spectrum of GWs~\cite{Assadullahi:2009nf}. Furthermore, the possible formation of boson stars and even of primordial black holes could leave a distinctive signal in the GW spectrum. Other potential signatures have been studied in the past~\cite{0801.0307}.

We are only in the early stages of an ambitious programme to explore the formation, evolution and dynamics of the many inhomogeneities distinctive of string cosmology after inflation due to the rich structure of moduli fields. Their imprint in the GW spectrum may eventually provide important information about the structure and composition of the extra dimensions in string theory.

\section{The role of gauge fields during inflation \label{sec:axioninflation}}

\subsection{The abelian limit \label{sec:abelian}}

In the limit of small gauge couplings and/or small gauge field amplitudes, any non-abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group will (approximately) act as $N^2 - 1$ copies of an abelian group. Let us thus, also for later reference, begin by briefly reviewing the case of a pseudoscalar inflaton $\phi$ coupled to an abelian gauge field $A_\mu$~\cite{Turner:1987bw,Garretson:1992vt,Anber:2006xt} (for recent analyses see e.g.\ \cite{Barnaby:2010vf,Barnaby:2011qe,Domcke:2016bkh,Jimenez:2017cdr}),
\label{eq:rev_action_pseudoscalar}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S}= \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{|g|} \left[M_P^2 \frac{R}{2} -\frac{1}{2} \, \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial^\mu \phi - V(\phi) - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} - \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \phi F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} \right ]\, .
\end{equation}
Here $V(\phi)$ denotes the inflaton potential, $F_{\mu \nu} \, (\tilde F^{\mu \nu})$ is the (dual) field-strength tensor of the abelian gauge group and $\alpha/\Lambda$ encodes the coupling between the inflaton and the gauge field.\footnote{Identifying $\phi$ as an axion of a global $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry constrains the coupling $\alpha/\Lambda$. For $\alpha = e^2/(4 \pi)$, the scale $\Lambda$ indicates the scale at which coupling of the axion to the chiral anomaly becomes relevant and the effective theory should be replaced by a more fundamental theory. This scale $\Lambda$ should lie above the Hubble scale of inflation. On the other hand, the scalar potential breaking the axion shift symmetry through non-perturbative contributions is periodic in $2 \pi \Lambda$, with slow-roll inflation requiring $\Lambda \gtrsim M_P$ (the extra friction arising from the last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_action_pseudoscalar} cannot evade this conclusion for the parameter values considered here). A UV-completion is thus far from obvious (see Ref.~\cite{Agrawal:2018mkd} for recent progress), and we here retain the effective field theory point of view, treating $V(\phi)$ and $\alpha/\Lambda$ as independent free parameters.}



Since $F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu}$ is CP-odd, it will prove useful to work with the Fourier-modes of the gauge field in the chiral basis, 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Fourier_A}
	 \vec{A}(\tau, \vec{x}) = \int \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k}}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \left[ \sum_{\lambda = \pm} \tilde{A}_{\lambda}(\tau, \vec{k}) \vec{e}_\lambda (\vec{k}) \hat{a}(\vec{k}) e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}} + \tilde{A}_{\lambda}^*(\tau, \vec{k}) \vec{e}^*_{\lambda^\prime} (\vec{k}) \hat{a}^\dagger (\vec{k}) e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}} \right] \; ,
\end{equation}
with the polarization vectors fulfilling $\vec e_\lambda(\vec k) \cdot \vec k = 0$, $\vec e_\lambda(\vec k) \cdot \vec e_{\lambda'}(\vec k) = \delta_{\lambda \lambda'}$ and  $i \vec k \times \vec e_\lambda(\vec k) = \lambda  k\vec e_{\lambda}(\vec k)$ with $k = |\vec k|$. $\hat a^{(\dagger)}$ denotes the annihilation (creation) operator and $\tilde{A}_\lambda(\vec k)$ the corresponding Fourier coefficients. Here $\vec k$ and $\vec x$ denote the co-moving wave vector and coordinates,
\begin{equation}
 \textrm{d} s^2 = g_{\mu \nu }\textrm{d}x^\mu \textrm{d}x^\nu = a^2 (\tau) (-\textrm{d} \tau^2 + \textrm{d} \vec{x}^2 ) = a^2 (\tau) \eta_{\mu \nu }\textrm{d}x^\mu \textrm{d}x^\nu \,,
\end{equation}
with $a(\tau)$ the metric scale factor and $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ the Minkowski metric. Adopting temporal gauge, we have moreover set $A_0 = 0$. The equations of motion for the homogeneous inflaton field and for the gauge field then read,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rev_motion}
\ddot \phi + 3 H \dot{\phi} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} & = \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle \ ,\\
\label{eq:rev_motionAfourier}
 \tilde{A}''_{\pm}(\tau,\vec{k})  + \left[ k^2 \mp \, k  \, \frac{2\xi}{-\tau} \right]\tilde{A}^{a}_{\pm}(\tau,\vec{k}) & =  \ 0 \ , 
\end{align}
where we have introduced the physical `electric' and `magnetic' fields as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rev_electric_magnetic}
	\vec{E} \equiv -\frac{1 }{a^2} \frac{\textrm{d} \vec{A}}{\textrm{d} \tau}  \ , \qquad \qquad  \vec{B} \equiv \frac{1}{a^2} \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}  \ .
\end{equation}
The expectation values $\langle \bullet \rangle$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion} indicate the spatial average.
The parameter $\xi$, encoding the tachyonic instability in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motionAfourier}, is given by
\begin{equation}
\xi \equiv \frac{\alpha \, \dot{\phi}}{2 \, \Lambda \, H} \ ,
\label{eq:rev_xi}
\end{equation}
with $H = \dot a/a$ denoting the Hubble rate during inflation. In the following we will consider $\dot \phi > 0$ and hence $\xi > 0$ without loss of generality.

In the slow-roll regime, $|\ddot \phi| \ll H |\dot \phi|, | V_{,\phi}|$, we can neglect the change of $\xi$ on the time-scales relevant in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motionAfourier}. This enables us to approximately decouple the equations and solve the equation of motion for the gauge fields analytically, with a parametric dependence on the parameter $\xi$,
\begin{equation}
 \tilde A_\lambda(\tau,k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2k}} e^{\lambda \pi \xi/2} W_{- i \lambda \xi, 1/2}(2 i k \tau) \,.
 \label{eq:rev_Whittaker}
\end{equation}
Here $W_{k,m}(z)$ is the Whittaker function. For $\lambda = +$ this describes an oscillatory function which starts to grow exponentially around horizon crossing ($k |\tau| \sim 1$), before becoming approximately constant on super-horizon scales, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Whittakerabelian}. The $\lambda = -$ mode does not exhibit this tachyonic instability and remains oscillatory.
The overall normalization is obtained by matching to the Bunch--Davies vacuum in the infinite past, namely 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{A}_{\lambda}(\tau,k)\approx\frac{e^{-ik\tau}}{\sqrt{2k}}\quad\textrm{as }\tau\to-\infty.\label{eq:BDvac}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
 \center
 \includegraphics{whittaker.pdf}
 \caption{Enhanced helicity mode described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_Whittaker} for different values of $\xi$. The solid (dashed) curves show the absolute value of growing (decaying) component. For a suitable choice of the complex phase of the Whittaker function (see also App.~\ref{app:asymptotics}), the growing (decaying) component is the real (imaginary) part.}
 \label{fig:Whittakerabelian}
\end{figure}


The explicit solution~\eqref{eq:rev_Whittaker} in turn enables us to explicitly evaluate the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion}. For $\xi \gtrsim 3$ this is well approximated by
\begin{equation}
 \langle \vec E \cdot \vec B \rangle  \simeq - 2.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^4} e^{2 \pi \xi} \,.
 \label{eq:rev_EB}
\end{equation}
Recalling the definition of $\xi$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_xi}, this enables us to (numerically) solve Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion}. 
The resulting evolution of 
this system with the inflaton coupled to an abelian gauge field 
has been studied e.g.\ in Refs.~\cite{Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2010vf,Cook:2011hg,Barnaby:2011qe,Anber:2012du,Linde:2012bt,Domcke:2016bkh}, obtaining the following key results:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The tachyonic enhancement of the $A_+$ modes leads to a significant backreaction in the equation of motion for $\phi$, which is exponentially sensitive to $\xi$. This can be interpreted as an additional friction term for the inflaton.
 \item In single field inflation models, $V_{,\phi}/V$ typically increases over the course of inflation, implying an increasing value of $\xi$. Constraints on non-gaussianities in the CMB impose $\xi_\text{CMB} \lesssim 2.5$ whereas the backreaction mentioned above dynamically limits the growth of $\xi$ over the course of 50-60 e-folds of inflation, typically leading to $\xi \lesssim 10$.\footnote{Note that for $\xi \gtrsim 4.5$, perturbative control has been shown to break down~\cite{Ferreira:2015omg, Peloso:2016gqs}.}
 \item The presence of the gauge fields leads to an additional source term for the scalar and tensor power spectra. Due to the increasing value of $\xi$ this effect is typically largest at small scales (i.e.\ towards the end of inflation).
\end{itemize}

For later reference, let us discuss in detail three quantities which will be relevant for the analysis carried out in the next parts of this work: the gauge field variance, the homogeneity scale and decoherence time.

\textit{Variance}. Isotropy ensures that averaged over the whole universe $\langle \vec A \rangle = 0$, but we may estimate the magnitude of the gauge fields in any Hubble patch by computing the variance,
\begin{align}
 \langle 0 | \vec A(\tau, \vec x) \vec A(\tau, \vec x) | 0 \rangle^{1/2} & = \left(\int  \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k} }{(2\pi)^3}  \left[ \tilde{A}_{+}(\vec{k})  \tilde{A}_{+}^*(\vec{k}) + \tilde{A}_{-}(\vec{k})  \tilde{A}_{-}^*(\vec{k} ) \right] \right)^{1/2} \nonumber \\
 & =  e^{\pi \xi/2} \sqrt{ \int \frac{ \textrm{d} k}{2\pi^2} \, \frac{k}{2} \left| W_{-i\xi,1/2}(2ik\tau)\right|^2 } \nonumber \\
 &  = \frac{aH}{2\pi} e^{\pi \xi/2} \sqrt{ \int_0^{x_{UV}} \textrm{d} x\, x \left|W_{-i\xi,1/2}(- 2 i x)\right|^2 } \nonumber \\
 & \simeq \frac{1}{(-\tau)}\,  0.008 \times e^{2.8 \xi} \,.	 \label{eq:variance_abelian}
\end{align}
Here we set the upper integration limit to $x_{UV} = 2 \xi$, so as to not count the vacuum contribution. In agreement with Ref.~\cite{Jimenez:2017cdr}, we find that all the integrals of this type performed in this paper are rather insensitive to the choice of $x_{UV}$ for $\xi \gtrsim 3$.


\textit{Homogeneity}. The energy density stored in the gauge fields can be computed as  $(\vec E^2 + \vec B^2)/2$ with
\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{2} \langle \vec E^2 \rangle & = \frac{1}{2 a^4} \int \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k}}{(2 \pi)^3} \bigg|\frac{\partial \tilde{A}_+^k(\tau)}{\partial \tau}\bigg|^2  = \frac{H^4}{8 \pi^2}e^{\pi \xi} \int_0^{2 \xi} \textrm{d} x \,\,x^3 \bigg| \frac{\partial W_{-i \xi, 1/2}(- 2 i x)}{\partial x} \bigg|^2 \,,\\
  \frac{1}{2} \langle \vec B^2 \rangle & = \frac{1}{2 a^4} \int \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k}}{(2 \pi)^3} k^2 \bigg|\tilde{A}_+^k(\tau)\bigg|^2  = \frac{H^4}{8 \pi^2}e^{\pi \xi} \int_0^{2 \xi} \textrm{d} x \,\,x^3 \bigg|  W_{-i \xi, 1/2}(- 2 i x)\bigg|^2 \,.
\end{align}
We can now determine for each value of $\xi$, the value of $x_{90}$ for which $90\%$ of the energy is contained in modes with $x < x_{90}$, see  left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:propertiesabelian}. For any $x > x_{90}$, we can then safely model the gauge field as a homogeneous background field. We conclude that for (the phenomenologically interesting) large values of $\xi \gtrsim 3$, the homogeneity scale lies at $x_{90} \lesssim {\cal O}(1)$, so that on sub-horizon scales, this gauge field acts like a homogeneous background field. This approximation becomes better for larger values of $\xi$. For reference, the dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:propertiesabelian} indicates the value of $x$ for which $95\%$ of the energy is contained within $x < x_{95}$.

\caption{Properties of the gauge fields in the abelian regime. \textit{Left panel:} Scale of homogeneity for different values of $\xi$, defined such that $90\%$ ($95\%$) of the energy is contained in modes with $- k \tau = x < x_{90}$ ($x < x_{95}$). \textit{Right panel}: $|A^\lambda_k \pi^\lambda_k|$ for $\xi = 0, 2, 3, 4$. Decoherence occurs once $|A^\lambda_k \pi^\lambda_k| \gg 1$.}
  \label{fig:propertiesabelian}
\end{figure}

\textit{Decoherence.} For any given mode decoherence is reached if $|\tilde{A}^\lambda_k \pi^\lambda_k| \gg 1$~\cite{Guth:1985ya}. Using the free-field expression for the conjugate momentum, $\pi^\lambda_k = \partial_0 \tilde{A}^\lambda_k$, the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:propertiesabelian} demonstrates that decoherence is reached at $x \sim \xi$. As a further check, in order to establish the transition to the classical behaviour, we computed the number of particles $n_k$ in each mode (see~\cite{Brax:2010ai}) and we checked at which point the regime $n_k \gg 1$ is reached. The results agree with those shown in Fig. \ref{fig:propertiesabelian}\,: decoherence is reached at $x \sim \xi$.


In summary, we find that in the abelian limit, any Hubble patch develops a classical, approximately homogeneous gauge field background, whose average magnitude grows exponentially with $\xi$ as indicated in Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}. In the next section, we will highlight the key changes to this picture in the non-abelian regime. 

\subsection{Non-abelian regime}

Let us now consider the same action as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_action_pseudoscalar}, but now in the case of an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge group,
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S} & = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{|g|} \left[M_P^2 \frac{R}{2} -\frac{1}{2} \, \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial^\mu \phi - V(\phi) - \frac{1}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F_a^{\mu \nu} - \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \phi F^a_{\mu \nu} \tilde F_a^{\mu \nu} \right ] \nonumber \\
& \equiv \int d^4 x \, \sqrt{-g} \, \left[\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH} + \mathcal{L}_{\phi} + \mathcal{L}_{\rm YM} + \mathcal{L}_{\rm CS}\right] \,. \label{eq:action}
\end{align}
The resulting equations of motion for the homogeneous inflaton field $\phi(\tau)$ and the gauge fields $A^a_\mu(\tau,\vec x)$ read:
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\phi} + 3H \dot{\phi} + V_{,\phi} + \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \, \frac{\varepsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} }{ a^3(t)} \, F^a_{\mu\nu} F^a_{\rho\sigma} = 0 \;,
	\label{eq:phib}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:eq_motion_final}
	\eta^{\nu\sigma} \left\{\Box A_\sigma^a - \partial_\sigma \left(\partial_\mu \eta^{\mu\rho} A_\rho^a \right)+ e \varepsilon^{a b c} \eta^{\mu\rho} \left[ 2A_\rho^b \partial_\mu A_\sigma^c + \left( \partial_\mu A_\rho^b\right) A_\sigma^c - A_\mu^b \partial_\sigma A_\rho^c \right] + \right. \\
	+ \left. e^2 \eta^{\mu\rho} \left[ A_\rho^a \left( A_\mu^b A_\sigma^b \right) - A_\sigma^a \left( A_\mu^b A_\rho^b \right) \right] \right\} + \frac{\alpha}{2 \Lambda} \phi^\prime \varepsilon^{0 \nu j k} \left[2 \partial_j A^a_k + e \varepsilon^{abc} A^b_j A^c_k\right] = 0 \; ,
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the $\Box$-operator defined as usual as $\Box \equiv g^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu}$ which here is expressed in co-moving coordinates.

The non-linear equation~\eqref{eq:eq_motion_final} is highly sensitive to the presence of a gauge field background as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian}. An exact treatment of the system requires solving the non-linear coupled system of equations of motions in an exponentially expanding background, a very challenging task. Instead, we will work in a linear approximation (as in Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka}), expanding the gauge fields around a homogeneous background, denoted by $A^{(0)}(\tau)$, so that 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:background_plus_linear}
A(\tau, \vec x) = A^{(0)}(\tau) + \delta A(\tau, \vec x).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We will discuss the (classical) evolution of the background in Sec.~\ref{sec:background} and the (quantum) evolution of the fluctuations in Sec.~\ref{sec:linearized}. This treatment is valid as long as the evolution of the background is indeed governed by the classical equation of motion, i.e.\ as long as the growth of the fluctuations does not overcome the classical motion.  A similar condition ensures the washout of the initial inhomogeneities: As discussed above, the energy stored in the gauge fields enhanced during the abelian regime is peaked on super-horizon scales. This physical scale arises from a dynamical equilibrium between a continuous re-sourcing of the background gauge field by (enhanced) horizon-crossing modes and the red-shifting of longer wavelength modes. Consequently, a suppression of the growth of the gauge-field fluctuations in the non-abelian regime (with respect to their abelian counterpart) diminishes the supply of modes sourcing the peak in the Fourier spectrum, leading to a red-shift of this inhomogeneity scale to larger, far super-horizon scales. To make the overall picture clear from the start, we highlight in the following some of the key results, the derivation of these will follow in Secs~\ref{sec:background} and \ref{sec:linearized}, correspondingly. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width = 0.7 \textwidth]{sketch.pdf}
 \caption{Sketch of the evolution of the average magnitude of the gauge fields from the abelian to the non-abelian regime. The vertical line marks the transition from the abelian limit to the full non-abelian theory, the gray circle indicates the requirement of matching the initial conditions accordingly. In the non-abelian regime, the fluctuations grow slower, but may nevertheless at some point overcome the classically evolving background. This region of parameter space is beyond the scope of the present paper, as indicated by gray shaded region. }
 \label{fig:sketch}
\end{figure}


 We find that the background field dynamically evolves towards an isotropic configuration with two distinct asymptotic behaviours. On the one hand, for small initial conditions, the co-moving background evolves towards a constant value, and thus remains small compared to tachyonically enhanced fluctuations, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}. 
 In this regime, we are essentially back in the abelian limit, i.e.\ the fluctuations are well described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_Whittaker} with 3 enhanced  and 3 oscillating modes.\footnote{ One may worry about the justification of the linearization~\eqref{eq:background_plus_linear} in this regime. From Eq.~\eqref{eq:eq_motion_final}, we note that in the limit $A^{(0)}(\tau) \rightarrow 0$, a necessary condition for the linearization to be valid is $e \, (\delta A)^2  \ll \partial_\mu \delta A$, or in other words $ e \, \delta A \ll k = x/(- \tau)$, indicating the regime where the non-abelian terms become irrelevant. For modes crossing the horizon  ($x = 1$), this condition holds if
 \begin{equation}
  0.008 \times \exp(2.8 \, \xi) \ll 1/e \,,
  \label{eq:Conditionabelian}
 \end{equation}
where we have inserted Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}. For far super-horizon modes, the non-abelian terms become more important. However, at this point due to a red-shift in momentum and a decay in the amplitude, the contribution of these modes to e.g.\ the variance of the energy density is negligible. Note that the condition~\eqref{eq:Conditionabelian} is not sufficient to justify the linearization of the equation of motion for the inflaton~\eqref{eq:phib}. In the abelian regime, the last term contains at least two powers of $\delta A_\mu^a$, and its relative importance will depend on the coupling strength $\alpha/\Lambda$. We will return to the importance of these non-linear effects in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:example}.} On the other hand, for sufficiently large initial conditions (and only if $\xi \geq 2$), there is an asymptotic solution for the background which, in terms of the comoving gauge field $A^{(0)}$, grows as $1/|\tau|$. 
We stress that this background is driven by classical motion and, contrary to the approximately homogeneous gauge field formed in the abelian case, it is not sourced by super-horizon fluctuations. In this regime, the background significantly modifies the equation of motion for the fluctuations. Consequently, we find that only a single gauge field mode is enhanced, and the enhancement is moreover significantly suppressed compared to the abelian case. Given the strong gauge field production in the abelian regime and the increasing value of $\xi$ over the course of inflation, eventually the growing background solution will be triggered. The point at which this happens depends on the gauge coupling $e$ and the CP-violating coupling $\alpha/\Lambda$. A sketch of this overall picture is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:sketch}.

\section{Full equations of motion \label{app:fulleom}}

\noindent In this Appendix we report the full computation of the linearized equations of motion for the gauge fields and metric perturbations, including the non-dynamical metric degrees of freedom that were discarded in Sec.~\ref{sec:linearized} of the main text, labeled lapse $N$ and shift $N^i$ in the ADM formalism~\cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}. We found some minor discrepancies with respect to the results in \cite{Adshead:2013nka} that however do not affect their results.

We start from the expressions for the action and the metric reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:linearized}. The metric in matrix form is
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{pmatrix}
-N^2 + h_{ij} N^i N^j & h_{ji} N^i \\
h_{ij} N^j & h_{ij}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
and it can be easily established that the components of the inverse matrix are
\begin{equation}
g^{00} = - \frac{1}{N^2} \quad g^{0i} = \frac{N^i}{N^2} \quad g^{ij} = h^{ij} - \frac{N^i N^j}{N^2} \,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, it is useful to notice that $\sqrt{-g} = N \sqrt{h}$,\footnote{The four-dimensional metric is always denoted by the letter $g$, while the three-dimensional metric is denoted by $h$. $h_{ij}/h^{ij}$ is used in order to raise/lower indices in the three-dimensional space.} where $h = \text{det} \left(h_{ij}\right)$ and $h^{ij} = \left(h_{ij}\right)^{-1}$. Using these definitions, the Einstein-Hilbert term takes the standard form derived in the original paper on the ADM formalism~\cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FullEH}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{EH}} = \sqrt{h} \left[N R^{(3)} + \frac{1}{N} \left(E^{ij} E_{ij} - E^2\right) \right]\,,
\end{equation}
where $R^{(3)}$ is the spatial curvature (computed using $h_{ij}$), while\footnote{The covariant derivative $\nabla$ is computed using $h_{ij}$.}
\begin{equation}
E_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(h'_{ij} - \nabla_i N_j - \nabla_j N_i\right) \,, \quad E = E^i_i\,.
\end{equation}

\noindent Expressing the Lagrangian in terms of its individual contributions as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:action}, we obtain for the contribution ${\cal L}_\phi$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\phi} = \sqrt{h} \, \left[\frac{1}{2 N} \left(\phi' - N^i \partial_i \phi\right)^2 - \frac{N}{2} h^{ij} \partial_i \phi \partial_j \phi - N V(\phi)\right]\,,
\end{equation}
while, after using some simple algebra, we split the Yang--Mills Lagrangian as follows
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{YM}} & = \frac{\sqrt{h}}{2 N} \left[h^{ij} \left(F^a_{0i} F^a_{0j} + 2 F^a_{0i} F^a_{jl} N^l + F^a_{ik} F^a_{jl} N^k N^l\right)\right] - \frac{\sqrt{h} N}{4} h^{ij} h^{kl} F^a_{ik} F^a_{jl}  \nonumber \\
& \equiv \mathcal{L}_{\text{YM},1} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{YM},2} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{YM},3} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{YM},4} \,.
\label{eq:LagrangianYMF}
\end{align}

Expanding each of the four terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:LagrangianYMF} we get:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{YM},1} & = \frac{\sqrt{h}}{2 N} h^{ij} F^a_{0i} F^a_{0j} = \nonumber \\
& = \frac{\sqrt{h}}{2 N} h^{ij} \left[\partial_0 A^a_i \partial_0 A^a_j + \partial_i A^a_0 \partial_j A^a_0 - \partial_0 A^a_i \partial_j A^a_0  - \partial_0 A^a_j \partial_i A^a_0 + \right.\nonumber \\
& + e \varepsilon^{abc} \left(\partial_0 A^a_i A^b_0 A^c_j - \partial_i A^a_0 A^b_0 A^c_j + \partial_0 A^a_j A^b_0 A^c_i - \partial_j A^a_0 A^b_0 A^c_i\right) \nonumber \\
& \left.+ e^2 \left(A^b_0 A^b_0 A^c_i A^c_j - A^b_0 A^b_j A^c_0 A^c_i\right)\right] \,,

The Chern-Simons term is

\end{align}

Given the expressions for each term of the action, we can compute the expansion at  the quadratic order in the field fluctuations. We expand the three-dimensional metric to second order as follows:
\begin{equation}
h_{ij} = a^2 \left(\delta_{ij} + \gamma_{ij} + \frac{\gamma_{ik} \gamma_{kj}}{2} \right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{ij}$ is a transverse and traceless quantum fluctuation: $\gamma_{ii} = \partial_i \gamma_{ij} = 0$.\footnote{Notice that spatial indices are raised and lowered by $h_{ij}/h^{ij}$, while gauge indices are raised and lowered with just a $\delta_{ij}$. Everytime we write a gauge field fluctuation with two lowered indices we imply that the first one is the gauge index.} We also notice that, using the standard expression $\delta g = g g^{ij} \delta g_{ij}$, where $g = \text{det}(g)$ the determinant $h = \text{det}(h_{ij})$ can be expanded as
\begin{equation}
\frac{h}{a^2} = \text{det} \left(e^{\text{Tr} \left[\ln (h_{ij}/a^2)\right]}\right) = \text{det} \left(e^{\text{Tr} \left[ \gamma_{ij} + \frac{\gamma_{ik}\gamma_{kj}}{2} - \frac{\gamma_{ik}\gamma_{kj}}{2} \right]}\right) = 1 \,.
\end{equation}
We also notice that in spatially flat gauge the Christoffel symbols vanish ${\Gamma^i}_{jk} = 0$ and then $\nabla_i = \partial_i$. Finally we expand the lapse and shift around the FRW background\footnote{{Formally, lapse and shift have to be expanded up to second order. It turns out that the second order can be eliminated using the background equations of motion (see~\cite{Adshead:2013nka}), and does not affect the subsequent results.}}
\begin{equation}
N = a \left(1+ \delta N\right) \,, \qquad N^i \equiv \delta N^i\,.
\end{equation}

We proceed with the computation of the quadratic action and we report the results term by term to make it easier tracking back the various terms. We start from the Einstein-Hilbert component
\begin{align}
S_{\rm EH} & = \int \textrm {d}^4 x \, \frac{a^2}{2} \left[  \frac{ \gamma_{ij} \partial_l \partial_l \gamma_{ij} }{4} - 6 \mathcal{H}^2 + \frac{\gamma^\prime_{ij} \gamma^\prime_{ij}}{4}  + \right. \nonumber \\ 
& \left. + \frac{4 \mathcal{H}}{a^2} (1 - \delta N) \partial_{i} N_{i} + 6 \mathcal{H}^2 \delta N (1- \delta N) - \left( \frac{\partial_{i} N_{i}}{a^2} \right)^2 + \frac{\partial_{(i} N_{j)} \partial_{(i} N_{j)}}{a^4} \right] \,,
\end{align}
where the contribution from the three-dimensional curvature $R^{(3)}$ is just the first term $a^2/8 \, \gamma_{ij} \partial_l \partial_l \gamma_{ij}$. Concerning the scalar field, the second-order action takes the form:
\begin{align}
\delta^2 S_\phi & = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \, \left[\frac{a^2}{2} \left( \left(\delta \phi'\right)^2 - \partial_i \delta \phi \partial_i \delta \phi - a^2 V'' \left(\delta \phi \right)^2 \right) - \right. \nonumber \\
& \left.- \frac{a^2}{2} \left(\frac{2}{a^2} \langle \phi' \rangle N_i \partial_i \delta \phi + 2 \langle \phi' \rangle\delta N \delta \phi' + \langle \phi' \rangle^2 \left(\delta N\right)^2 - 2 a^2 V' \delta \phi \delta N\right)\right]\,.
\end{align}

\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}
Understanding inhomogeneities in the observed universe is one of the central challenges in cosmology. The tendency for gravitational collapse is much weaker in an expanding universe than in flat space. Therefore, mechanisms for the fast growth of cosmological perturbations are of much interest. For instance, in matter domination an overdensity $\delta = \delta\rho/\rho$ (where $\rho$ is the energy density and $\delta\rho$ is the perturbed energy density) grows linearly with the scale factor: $\delta(t) \propto a(t)$. Here, we will present a scenario for much faster growth.

This growth will take place in a pressure-less fluid composed of non-relativistic fermionic particles $\psi$ in the early universe, prior to \textit{Big Bang Nucleosynthesis} (BBN).\footnote{For a recent review of pre-BBN physics see~\cite{Allahverdi:2020bys}.} The scenario has two essential ingredients: \textit{i)} an \textit{Early Matter Domination} (EMD) era;\footnote{Usually an epoch of EMD leads to linear growth of overdensities, similar to what happens in the dark matter dominated epoch in the late universe~\cite{Georg:2016yxa, Georg:2017mqk, Erickcek:2011us, Redmond:2018xty}.} \textit{ii)} an interaction between the $\psi$ particles mediated by a massive scalar field $\phi$ in the EMD epoch. These ingredients arise naturally in string/supergravity models.

We present explicit examples of background solutions incorporating the interactions and then study perturbations to exhibit the rapid growth. The physical reason for the fast growth is the scalar field mediated force, as $\psi$ particles attract each other with a stronger than gravitational interaction. We will also initiate a study of the phenomenological implications of this scenario. These will include the production of \textit{Primordial Black Holes} (PBHs) and \textit{Gravitational Waves} (GWs).\\

Let us start by discussing the generic features of the essential ingredients of our setup.\\
 
\noindent {\it{Early Matter Domination}:}

A generic feature of string/supergravity models is the existence of moduli, i.e. gravitationally coupled scalar fields whose \textit{vevs} parametrise the size and shape of the extra-dimensions. These are massless at tree level and typically acquire masses due to higher-order corrections or loop effects. In many cases, moduli masses are set by the scale of supersymmetry breaking and it is well below the Hubble scale at the end of inflation. This implies a displacement of the scalar fields from their late time minima. The displaced scalars oscillate about their minima when the Hubble constant falls below their masses, leading to epochs of matter domination (see e.g.~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, hep-ph/9308292, hep-ph/9308325, hep-ph/9507453, Cicoli:2016olq,  1906.03025, Erickcek:2011us}  and~\cite{1502.07746} for a review). 

To accommodate the successful predictions of BBN, an EMD epoch has to end with the universe reheating above $\sim 3 \, \rm{MeV}$. This happens with the decay of the constituents of the universe during the EMD epoch. We note that while an oscillating modulus is one of the most natural ways to enter an epoch of EMD, this is not necessary for our scenario, which is insensitive to the exact nature of the particle causing the EMD epoch (we will denote quantities associated with this by a sub/superscript ‘b', for \textit{background}).\\

\noindent {\it{Scalar Field Mediated Interactions}:}

The other key element is a hidden sector fermion ($\psi$) experiencing a scalar ($\phi$) mediated force. Cosmological effects of a hidden fermion experiencing a scalar mediated force have been extensively studied in recent years, see e.g.~\cite{Das:2005yj, Amendola:1999er, Vagnozzi:2021quy, Tsai:2021irw, Savastano:2019zpr,  Amendola:2017xhl, Damour:1990tw, hep-th/9408025, Amendola:1999er, gr-qc/0108016, astro-ph/0303145,
astro-ph/0208032, astro-ph/0306343, astro-ph/0212518, astro-ph/0307350, Amendola:2003wa, Domenech:2021uyx}.

We will take $\psi$ to be part of a hidden sector. Its interactions with the visible sector will be feeble\footnote{Therefore the usual fifth-force bounds are not relevant.}, but it will be strongly interacting with $\phi$. In the Einstein frame, the scalar couples to the trace of the energy-momentum of $\psi$: $g^{\mu \nu} T_{\mu \nu}^{(\psi)} = \rho_{\psi} - 3 p_\psi$, where $\rho_\psi$ and $p_\psi$ are the energy density and the pressure of the $\psi$ fluid respectively. At the level of cosmological fluids, this implies the non-conservation of stress tensors of individual components. The violation is proportional to the product between the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the $\psi$ component and the gradient of the mediating scalar. At the background level, once the scalar field is oscillating about its minimum (i.e. when $H \lesssim m_\phi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter) the fluids reach a scaling regime in which each component redshifts as matter and the energy exchange between fluids stops. However, the presence of the coupling leads to an attractive force between $\psi$ particles. This force leads to the fast growth of $\psi$ perturbations.\footnote{Note that in~\cite{Savastano:2019zpr} a similar mechanism causes matter perturbations to grow much faster compared to what happens in $\Lambda$CDM, i.e. $\delta(t) \propto a(t)^{1.62}$, even in a radiation dominated epoch. The present work is much inspired by this.}\\
 
We note that, when the coupling is non-vanishing, the background dynamics of the scalar field $\phi$ is affected. A complete study of the system would then require tracking the dynamics starting from the end of inflation, or fine-tuning the initial conditions. This is an interesting and important issue in all models that feature similar couplings~\cite{Das:2005yj, Amendola:1999er, Vagnozzi:2021quy, Tsai:2021irw, Savastano:2019zpr,  Amendola:2017xhl, Damour:1990tw, hep-th/9408025, Amendola:1999er, gr-qc/0108016, astro-ph/0303145,
astro-ph/0208032, astro-ph/0306343, astro-ph/0212518, astro-ph/0307350, Amendola:2003wa, Domenech:2021uyx}. Alternatively, one can consider scenarios in which a change in the equation of state $w_\psi$ of the $\psi$ component takes place at the energy scale of interest, going from $w_\psi = 1/3$ to $w_\psi = 0$. Given the form of the coupling, $\propto \rho_\psi (1 - 3 w_\psi)$, this would imply that the coupling is turned on only when the equation of state deviates from $1/3$. There are in principle various possible ways to achieve this, such as scenarios where the $\psi$ particles get mass from a hidden sector symmetry breaking when a hidden scalar field acquires a vacuum expectation value~\cite{Gehrlein:2019iwl, Shelton:2010ta}. Before the symmetry breaking the $\psi$ particles would essentially be massless and behave as relativistic degrees of freedom. In general the time scale of such a symmetry breaking is much smaller than Hubble time, so one would expect a rapid transition in the $\psi$ equation of state as assumed in this paper. The second approach is a time dependent coupling constant which  is a function of the scalar vacuum expectation value~\cite{Hinterbichler:2010es}. In this well studied symmetron-based model, one naturally turns on the fifth-force or a non-zero coupling between the fermion and the scalar  when the universe starts expanding followed by a symmetry breaking in a hidden scalar sector. It is instructive to note that the actual model building of our scenario is not the focus of this work. In this paper, we will use a phenomenological approach, parametrising the equation of state to keep track of the coupling. We leave a study of the microscopic realisation of such a transition to a future work.\\

Before closing the introduction, let us briefly mention the possible phenomenological implications of our scenario. Estimates of the scales involved give production of PBHs
in the sub-lunar mass range. These are known to be ideal candidates to constitute all of dark matter. GWs will be produced with the scalar field acting as a source for the perturbations and from the dynamics of the PBHs produced. This leads to GWs in a wide range of frequencies (from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{15}$ Hz).\\
 
This paper is structured as follows. In Sec.~\ref{background}, we describe our setup and obtain background solutions.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:Perturbations} we analyse perturbations and exhibit their fast growth. We outline phenomenological implications
in Sec.~\ref{pheno}, leaving detailed explorations for future work. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{conclude}.

\section{Coupled  Dynamics in the Early Universe}
\label{background}

In this section, we first describe the equations that govern the dynamics of our system. We then present the background (homogeneous) cosmology in which perturbations will exhibit fast growth.  The solution settles into a matter dominated phase within a few e-foldings of cosmological expansion: it is in this epoch that the fast growth of perturbations takes place.

As described in the introduction, the early universe we consider will have three constituents: a background component redshifting as matter ($b$)\footnote{E.g. an oscillating modulus.}, a dark sector fermion ($\psi$) and the scalar force mediator ($\phi$). The first two will be described by cosmological fluids, the latter by its equation of motion. In general, a coupling to the scalar via the trace of the stress tensor can exist for both `b' and `$\psi$'. The system is described by the following equations (see~\cite{Amendola:2003wa} and references therein):
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GeneralConservationBackground}
 \nabla^{\mu} T_{\mu \nu}^{b} &= - {\beta_{b}(\phi) \over M_{\rm pl} } g^{\rho \sigma} T_{\rho \sigma}^{b} \nabla_{\nu} \phi \,, \\
 \label{eq:GeneralConservationPsi}
 \nabla^{\mu} T_{\mu \nu}^{\psi} &= - {\beta_{\psi}(\phi) \over M_{\rm pl}}g^{\rho \sigma} T_{\rho \sigma}^{\psi} \nabla_{\nu} \phi \,, \\
 \label{eq:GeneralKGEquation}
 \left( \square  + m^{2} \right) \phi &=   {\beta_{b}(\phi) \over M_{\rm pl}} g^{\rho \sigma} T_{\rho \sigma}^{b} + {\beta_{\psi}(\phi) \over M_{\rm pl}} g^{\rho \sigma} T_{\rho \sigma}^{\psi} \ ,
\end{align}
%
 and
 %
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:Einstein}
  M_{\rm pl}^{2}  G_{\mu \nu} =  T_{\mu \nu},
\end{equation}
%
where $g_{\mu \nu}$ is the spacetime metric, $G_{\mu \nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\mu \nu} = T_{\mu \nu}^{(b)} + T_{\mu \nu}^{(\psi)} + T^{(\phi)}_{\mu \nu}$ is the total stress-energy tensor. 


The quantities $\beta_{b}(\phi)$ and $\beta_{\psi}(\phi)$ are  (field dependent) coupling constants and $M_{\rm pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass. Note that large values of the coupling constants $(\beta_{i}(\phi) \gg 1)$ imply that the scalar mediates a force that is stronger than gravity. Hierarchies in the strengths of the couplings can arise naturally in string models as a result of physical separation in the extra-dimensions between different sectors (see e.g.~\cite{Acharya:2018deu} and references therein for a recent discussion in the context of quintessence models). The goal of this paper is to exhibit the phenomenon of fast growth in a specific setting and thereby provide proof of the concept. Hence we will consider a constant coupling $\beta_\psi(\phi) \equiv \beta_\psi \gg 1$, while we take $\beta_b(\phi) = 0$ (a detailed exploration of the dynamics treating both the couplings as parameters is left for future work).

The stress tensors $T_{\mu \nu}^{(b)}$ and $T_{\mu \nu}^{(\psi)}$ will be taken to be of the perfect fluid form. The component `b' seeds the matter dominated epoch; we will take $w_b =0$. As mentioned in the introduction, the $\psi$ component will make a transition from being relativistic (at early times) to becoming non-relativistic within a few e-foldings of the expansion of the universe from the start of our numerical evolution. This transition sets the form of its (time-dependent) equation of state\footnote{We will describe its precise form soon.}, $w_{\psi}$. The scalar stress tensor $T^{(\phi)}_{\mu \nu}$ is given by $T^{(\phi)}_{\mu \nu} = \nabla_\mu \phi \nabla_\nu \phi - g_{\mu \nu} \left(\frac{1}{2} g^{\lambda \rho} \nabla_\lambda \phi \nabla_\rho \phi - V(\phi)\right)$. For simplicity, we work with $V(\phi) = {1 \over 2} m_\phi^{2} \phi^{2}$.

%Next, let us return to the equation of state for $\psi$. This can be  computed by taking the ratio between $p_\psi$ and $\rho_\psi$, that are given by
%\begin{align}
%p_\psi = \frac{g_*}{2\pi^2} \int_0^\infty dp \, \frac{p^4/3 E(p)}{\exp\left(E(p)/T\right) + 1} \,, \label{eq:PressionPsi} \\
%\rho_\psi = \frac{g_*}{2\pi^2} \int_0^\infty dp \, \frac{p^2 E(p)}{\exp\left(E(p)/T\right) + 1} \,, \label{eq:PressionPsi}
%\end{align}
%where $E(p) = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\psi^2}$, $g$ is the number of degrees of freedom of $\psi$ and we have set the Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1$. Thus the equation of state can be thought of as a function of time, the initial temperature $T_{\psi, \rm{in}}$ and mass of the $\psi$ field, $m_\psi$. As the temperature of $\psi$ falls, $w_{\psi}$ smoothly transitions from the $w=1/3$ to $w=0$.

Finally, the matter dominated epoch has to end before BBN. The time of the decays is controlled by the widths of the fields. We will treat the widths $\Gamma_{b}$, $\Gamma_{\psi}$ and $\Gamma_\phi$ as phenomenological parameters in our study.

\subsection{Background Dynamics}
\label{sec:BackgroundDynamics}

Next, let us turn to the background solution. Using the number of e-foldings $N = \int H dt$ as the evolution variable, for a homogeneous background Eq.s~\eqref{eq:GeneralConservationBackground}-\eqref{eq:GeneralKGEquation}  become
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ConservationBackground}
&\rho_b' + 3 H \rho_b = 0 \,, \\
\label{eq:ConservationPsi}
&\rho_\psi' + 3 (1 + w_\psi) H \rho_\psi = - \beta_\psi (1 - 3 w_\psi) \rho_\psi \phi' \,, \\
\label{eq:KGEquation}
&H H' \phi' + H^2 \phi'' + m_\phi^2 \phi + 3 H^2 \phi' = \beta_\psi (1 - 3 w_\psi) \rho_\psi \,,
\end{align}
%
where we have used that $p_b = 0$, $p_\psi = w_\psi \rho_\psi$, and the primes denote derivatives with respect to $N$. The  Friedmann equation reads:
\begin{equation}
H^2 = \frac{2 \left(\rho_b + \rho_\psi + \frac{1}{2} m_\phi^2 \phi^2 \right)}{6 - \phi'^2} \,.
\label{eq:FriedmannEquation}
\end{equation}
An explicit form of the background solution will be presented for two benchmark values of $\beta_{\psi} =20, 30$. We will refer to these as examples 1 and 2 respectively.

As already mentioned, we take a phenomenological approach to describe the equation of state of the $\psi$ component. Therefore, we parametrise $w_\psi$ in terms of the e-folding $N_{\rm NR}$ at which $w_\psi = 0.1$ and the width of the transition $\Delta N_{w_\psi}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EoS}
w_\psi = \frac{1}{6} \left(- \tanh\left(\Delta N_{w_\psi} (N - (N_{\rm NR} - \delta N))\right)\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta N = \arctanh(0.6/\Delta N_{w_\psi})$ is adjusted so that $w_\psi = 0.1$ at $N_{\rm NR}$. In the examples reported below, we fix $N_{\rm NR} = 2$ and use two values for $\Delta N_{w_\psi}$: $\Delta N_{w_\psi} = 3$ (example 1) and $\Delta N_{w_\psi} = 2$ (example 2), see Fig.~\ref{fig:EoS}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{EquationOfState.pdf}
\caption{Equation of state for $N_{\rm NR} = 2$ and $\Delta N_{w_\psi} = 2,3$.}
\label{fig:EoS}
\end{figure}

At early times, the Hubble constant is much greater than the mass of the scalar and $w_{\psi} =1/3$. The former implies that the friction term in the left hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:KGEquation} vanishes and the latter implies that the right hand side of the same equation vanishes. This implies that the scalar is at rest at $\phi = \phi_{\rm in}$ at early times: it contributes to the energy density of the universe as a result of its initial misalignment. This energy density is $\rho_{\phi, \rm{in}} = {1 \over 2} m_\phi^{2} \phi_{\rm in}^2$. We will track the evolution starting from the point when the ‘initial’ Hubble parameter is $H_{\rm in} \sim m_\phi$ (this will be taken to correspond to $N=N_{\rm in}=0$). The other initial conditions that need to be specified are the initial energy densities in $b$ and $\psi$, $\rho_{\psi, \rm{in}}$ and $\rho_{b, \rm{in}}$. In the explicit examples that we will report, we use $\phi_{\rm{in}} = 0.1 M_{Pl}$ and $\rho_{\psi, \rm{in}}/\rho_{b, \rm{in}} = 1$, $m_\phi/H_{\rm in} \simeq 1.22$. The exact value of $m_\phi/H_{\rm in}$ does not affect the results reported below, as long as the field is initially at rest.

As it is easy to guess (given that all components behave as matter when interactions are switched off), the system quickly settles into a scaling regime in which the energy densities of all the components redshift as $1/a^3$. We plot the fractional energy densities 
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega_b = \frac{\rho_b}{\rho} \,, \quad \Omega_{\psi} = \frac{\rho_\psi}{\rho} \,, \quad \Omega_\phi = \frac{\rho_\phi}{\rho} \,,
\end{equation}
and $\rho = \rho_b + \rho_\psi + \rho_\phi$, for our benchmark examples in Fig.~\ref{fig:ScalingRegime1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:ScalingRegime2}. The evolution of the scalar field for example 1 $(\beta_{\psi} =20, \Delta N_{w_\psi} = 3)$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FieldDynamics} (the $\phi$ evolution is very similar for example 2).

\section{Fast Growth of Perturbations}
\label{sec:Perturbations}

Having obtained the homogeneous background in the previous section, we now turn to the study of perturbations in the background. We will see that there is a fast growth of the perturbations in the matter dominated epoch which the background solutions asymptote to.

The equations governing the dynamics of the perturbations can be obtained in full generality by perturbing the Einstein equations as well as the conservation equations and the Klein-Gordon equation~\cite{Amendola:2003wa}. In our case, we will be interested in the perturbation of modes with wavelength $\lambda$ smaller than the Compton wavelength of the scalar field, namely $k/a \gg m_\phi$. In this limit, the equations of motion for the perturbations simplify. In Fourier space, the equations for the evolution of the fractional overdensities ($\delta_i$, $i=\psi, b$) and divergence of the dimensionless velocity perturbations ($\theta_i$, $i=\psi, b$) are\footnote{We follow the conventions of~\cite{Amendola:2003wa} for the definition of these.} 
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi}
&\delta_\psi'' + \left[(w_\psi + 1) \theta_\psi\right]' + 3 \left[w_{\psi, \rho} (1-\beta \phi') \delta_\psi\right]' = 0 \,, \\
\label{eq:PerturbationDeltaB}
&\delta_b'' + \left(2 + \frac{H'}{H}\right) \delta_b' - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_\psi \delta_\psi - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_b \delta_b = 0 \,, 
\end{align}
where $w_{\psi, \rho} = \frac{d w}{d \log \rho} = \rho w_\psi'/\rho'$ and
\begin{align}
&\theta_\psi \simeq - \frac{1}{w_\psi+1} \left[\delta_\psi' + 3 w_{\psi, \rho} (1 - \beta \phi') \delta_\psi\right] \,, \nonumber\\
&\theta_\psi' \simeq - f \theta_\psi + \frac{w_\psi + w_{\psi, \rho}}{1 + w_\psi} \kappa^2 \delta_\psi - \omega_\psi \delta_\psi - \frac{3}{2} (1+w_\psi) \Omega_b \delta_b \,,\nonumber
\end{align}
where $\kappa = k/(a H)$ and
\begin{align}
& f = \left[(1-3 w_\psi)(1 - \beta \phi') - w_{\psi, \rho} A + 1 + \frac{H'}{H}\right] \theta_\psi \,, \nonumber\\
& A = 3 + \beta \phi' \frac{1-3w_\psi}{1+w_\psi} \,, \nonumber\\
&\text{\small $\omega_\psi = \frac{3}{2} (1+w_\psi) \Omega_\psi \left[1 + 2 \beta_\psi^2 \frac{(1-3w_\psi)(1-3w_\psi - 3 w_{\psi,\rho})}{(1+w_\psi)^2}\right] \,.$} \nonumber
\end{align}
%
We solve numerically this system of equation with ‘adiabiatic’ initial conditions $\delta_{\psi, \rm{in}} = \delta_{b, \rm{in}}$ and $(\delta'_{b, \rm{in}}, \delta'_{\psi, \rm{in}})=(0,0)$ for various\footnote{We do not consider smaller values of $\kappa$ than those reported in the legends of Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx2} because they do not go non-linear within the regime of validity of Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB}.} values of $\kappa$ at $N = 0$, $\kappa_{\rm in}$. The solutions exhibit an exponentially fast growth as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx2} for example 1 and example 2 respectively. Since Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB} are valid in the sub-Compton regime, the solution for the various modes is valid until $k/a \gtrsim m_\phi$. The maximum $N$ at which the solution is reliable is denoted by the dotted lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx2}.

The system of equations has an exactly solvable regime. Once the $\psi$ component becomes non-relativistic, so that $w_\psi, w_{\rho, \psi} \simeq 0$, in the limit $\delta_{\psi} \gg \delta_b$ Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB} simplify significantly:
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EqDeltaPsiSimplified}
&\delta_\psi'' + \frac{1}{2} \delta_\psi' - \tilde{\omega}_{\psi} \delta_\psi = 0 \,, \\
\label{eq:EqDeltaBSimplified}
&\delta_b'' + \frac{1}{2} \delta_b' - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_\psi \delta_\psi - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_b \delta_b = 0 \,,
\end{align}
%
where we have defined $\tilde{\omega}_\psi = \frac{3}{2} \Omega_\psi (1 + 2 \beta_\psi^2)$ and used the fact that $1 + \frac{H'}{H} \simeq \frac{1}{2}$ in a matter dominated universe.
Now, the equation for $\delta_\psi$ is decoupled and can be solved analytically. The growing mode is an exponential function: $\delta_\psi \propto \exp\left(\gamma_\beta N\right)$, with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Exponent}
\gamma_\beta = \frac{1}{4} \left(-1 + \sqrt{1 + 16 \tilde{\omega}_\psi}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
The exponents for the two examples under consideration are $\gamma_1 \simeq 13$ and $\gamma_2 \simeq 23$. Interestingly, in the regime $N \gtrsim N_{\rm NR}$, this is in agreement with the growth exponents obtained numerically (Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx2}) for adiabatic initial conditions. This indicates that the growth in $\delta_{\psi}$ essentially drives the growth in the system even for adiabatic initial conditions, see Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsNorm}. We have checked this numerically. Note that in the scaling regime $w_\psi = w'_\psi = 0$, so the term proportional to $\kappa^2$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB} vanishes. However, when the change of the equation of state described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:EoS} is taken into account, it is important that this term goes to zero sufficiently fast, otherwise it would compete with the term proportional to $\tilde{\omega}_\psi$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:EqDeltaPsiSimplified} that drives the exponential growth. We emphasise that it is in the scaling regime that Eq.~\eqref{eq:EqDeltaPsiSimplified} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:EqDeltaBSimplified} are valid.

The  solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB} can be trusted until the linear approximation breaks down, namely when $\delta_{b} \big{/} \delta_{b, \rm in} \lesssim A^{-1/2}_{\delta_{b, \rm in}}$ and 
$\delta_\psi \big{/} \delta_{\psi, \rm in}  \lesssim  A^{-1/2}_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}}$, where $A^{-1/2}_{\delta_{b, \rm in}}$ and  $A^{-1/2}_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}}$  are the dimensionless strength of the perturbations as defined by the power spectra. We will use  $N_{\rm NL}$ to denote the e-foldings at which the validity of the linear theory breaks down and non-linearities become important. In general, $N_{\rm NL}$ will depend on the initial conditions $(\delta_{b, \rm{in}}, \delta_{\psi, \rm{in}})$. From Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PerturbationsEx2} it is immediate to see the regions in which the linear approximation is valid: $N_{\rm NL}$ is fixed by the intersection of the perturbation mode curves with the horizontal light green (for $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}} = 10^{-10}$) and dark green (for $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}} = 10^{-16}$) lines. Note that for perturbations with both the reported initial amplitude values\footnote{Note that $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}}=10^{-10}$ is the value expected from a scale invariant inflationary power spectrum.}, the modes go non-linear within very few e-foldings after the onset of the matter dominated epoch and well within the regime of validity of the equations for each mode. We note that this estimate is conservative as the perturbations can in principle undergo some growth before we begin to track them leading to a higher value
of $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}}$. In both the examples and for the set of modes that we chose (which are among the first to go non-linear), we have $N_{\rm NL} \simeq 4.5$ for $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm in}} = 10^{-10}$. We will use this value for the estimates presented in the following sections.

The dotted lines indicate the maximum $N$ at which the solution with the corresponding color can be trusted, as Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB} require $k/a \gtrsim m_\phi$. All the modes get to $\delta/\delta_{\rm in} \gtrsim 10^9$ in the regime of validity of the equations.

\subsection{Decays}
\label{sec:Decay}

To accommodate the successes of BBN, the matter dominated era has to end with a reheating temperature $T \gtrsim \text{a few MeV}$. This will happen if the widths of the three components $\Gamma_b$, $\Gamma_\psi$ and $\Gamma_\phi$ satisfy
%
\begin{equation}
\label{d1}
\Gamma_i \gtrsim H_{\rm BBN} \,, \quad i = b, \psi, \phi \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $H_{\rm BBN} \simeq 10^{-24} \, \text{GeV}$. We also require that the decays do not occur before the epoch of fast growth sets in and the perturbations grow rapidly. This implies:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{d2}
H_{\rm BBN} \lesssim \Gamma_{b, \phi, \psi} \lesssim H_{\rm NL} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $H_{\rm NL}$ is the Hubble parameter at the time when the perturbations become non-linear.\\

If the background component is an oscillating modulus with mass $m_b$ and decay rate $\Gamma_b = m_b^3/M_{Pl}^2$, then Eq.~\eqref{d2} would imply
\begin{equation}
m_{b, \rm min} \lesssim m_b \lesssim m_{b, \rm min} \exp\left(\frac{3}{4} (N_{\rm BBN} - N_{\rm NL})\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $m_{b, \rm min} = \left(H_{\rm BBN} M_{Pl}^2\right)^{1/3} \simeq 20 \, \text{TeV}$.

The conditions in Eq.~\eqref{d1} and Eq.~\eqref{d2} also constrain the strength of interaction of $\phi$ and $\psi$. For instance, let us consider the case in which the decays take place via Yukawa interactions
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \supset y \phi \bar{\chi} \chi + g \Psi \bar{\psi} \chi + \text{h.c.} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\chi$ is a visible sector fermion, while $\Psi$ is a visible sector scalar and $y$, $g$ are  Yukawa couplings. Then the decay rates are: 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\phi \simeq \frac{y^2 m_\phi}{8 \pi} \,, \quad \Gamma_{\psi} \simeq \frac{g^2 m_\psi}{16 \pi}.
\end{equation}
%
Concerning the $\psi$ component, the constraints in Eq.~\eqref{d2} translate into constraints for the product $g^2 m_\psi$. In the case of the scalar field $\phi$, since $m_\phi \simeq H_{\rm in}$ we can write the constraints in terms of $N_{\rm BBN}$ and $N_{\rm NL}$:
\begin{align}
y_{\rm min} \lesssim y \lesssim y_{\rm min} \, \exp\left(\frac{3}{4} (N_{\rm BBN} - N_{\rm NL})\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $N_{\rm BBN}$ is the value of $N$ at the time of BBN and
\begin{align}
&y_{\rm min} = \sqrt{8 \pi} \, \exp\left(-\frac{3}{4} N_{\rm BBN}\right) \,. \nonumber
\end{align}

The equations used in the evolution of the background and perturbations (in Sec.~\ref{sec:BackgroundDynamics} and the previous part of this section) do not incorporate the effects of the decays. They are in an instantaneous decay approximation and valid well before the decay processes play a significant role. Note that for a decay process with rate $\Gamma$, taking place in a matter dominated epoch, at times two e-foldings before $ t = \Gamma^{-1}$, the fraction of decayed particles is approximately five per cent. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we will require that the decay takes place at $N_{\rm dec}$, with $N_{\rm NL} \lesssim N_{\rm dec} \lesssim N_{\rm NL} + 2 \lesssim N_{\rm BBN}$.

For concreteness, taking $N_{\rm NR} = 2$ and $N_{\rm BBN} = N_{\rm NL} + 2$, we can give estimates for the Yukawa couplings. For instance, taking $N_{\rm NL} = 4.5$ from the numerical examples in Sec.~\ref{sec:Perturbations} yields $0.038 \lesssim y \lesssim 0.17$. %We can interpret the smallness of the Yukawa coupling $g$ as being determined by a UV scale $\Lambda \gg T_{\rm BBN}$. If the interaction term takes the form $\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{\langle s \rangle}{\Lambda} \, \Psi \bar{\psi} \chi + \text{h.c.}$ (where $s$ is a scalar field belonging to the UV theory whose \textit{vev} fixes the coupling) then $g \sim \langle s \rangle/\Lambda \sim 10^{-10}$ can be explained naturally.}

\section{Phenomenological Implications}
\label{pheno}
%

  The fast growth of perturbations can have various interesting phenomenological implications. Here, we initiate their study. Understanding them in detail
so as to extract precise predictions requires detailed studies which we leave for future.

\subsection{Primordial Black Holes}
\label{sec:PBHs}

Once the perturbations become non-linear, it is reasonable to expect that the overdensities will collapse, forming either PBHs~\cite{1966AZh, 10.1093/mnras/152.1.75, Grindlay:1975eb, Chapline:1975ojl, Khlopov:1980mg, Polnarev:1985btg, Carr:2016drx} or other kinds of compact objects, such as oscillons (see e.g.~\cite{Antusch:2017flz} for a study of oscillon formation in the context of an EMD model), primordial halos~\cite{Savastano:2019zpr}, miniclusters~\cite{Hogan:1988mp, Fairbairn:2017sil} or star-like objects, see e.g.~\cite{Krippendorf:2018tei, Visinelli:2021uve} for two comprehensive reviews. The formation of PBHs in a matter dominated universe is on one hand facilitated by the fact that the background pressure vanishes~\cite{Harada:2016mhb}. On the other hand, though, any deviation from spherical symmetry will tend to virialise the collapsing system, avoiding the formation of a horizon. We defer a detailed numerical study of the formation of PBHs and microhalos, along the lines of~\cite{Helfer:2016ljl, Widdicombe:2018oeo, Muia:2019coe, Nazari:2020fmk, Eggemeier:2020zeg, Eggemeier:2021smj}, to a future work. In the present paper, we will provide simple estimates to exhibit the potentially rich phenomenology.\\

The easiest way to determine the mass scale of the PBHs that can be potentially formed is by isolating the scales for which the $\psi$ perturbations go non-linear~\cite{Amendola:2017xhl, Georg:2016yxa, Georg:2017mqk}. In our setup, the growth involves modes that are sub-Compton, i.e. $k/a > m_\phi$. For this reason, one can expect the maximum mass of the PBH formed to be
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm PBH} \simeq \rho(N_{\rm NL}) \times \left(\frac{\epsilon_m}{m_\phi}\right)^3 \,,
\label{eq:MPBH0}
\end{equation}
where $(\epsilon_m/m_\phi)$ with $\epsilon_m < 1$ parametrises the wavelength of the collapsing mode. We can estimate the various terms in this expression in terms of $N_{\rm NL}$ and $N_{\rm BBN}$. Assuming that the background is always matter dominated, we can write $H_{\rm NL}/H_{\rm in} \simeq \exp\left(- 3 N_{\rm NL}/2\right)$ and $H_{\rm BBN}/H_{\rm in} \simeq \exp\left(- 3 N_{\rm BBN}/2\right)$. Therefore, we find
\begin{equation}
\rho({N_{\rm NL}}) = 3 H_{\rm NL}^2 M_{Pl}^2 = 3 \left(\frac{H_{\rm NL}}{H_{\rm in}}\right)^2 H_{\rm in}^2 M_{Pl}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we can approximate $H_{\rm in} \simeq m_\phi$ since the scalar field becomes dynamical at $N \simeq 0$. Hence, using for concreteness $\epsilon_m = 0.1$, we find from Eq.~\eqref{eq:MPBH0}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PBHMass}
M_{\rm PBH} \simeq 3 \times 10^{34} \, \text{g} \, \times  \exp\left(-\frac{3}{2} (2 N_{\rm NL} + N_{\rm BBN})\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where we have also used that $H_{\rm BBN} \simeq 10^{-24} \, \text{GeV}$. To make a concrete estimate, let us focus on the numbers that comes up from the numerical examples in Sec.~\ref{sec:Perturbations}. In those cases, perturbations with initial amplitude\footnote{We take the amplitude of the perturbations to be as given by the normalisation of scalar perturbations~\cite{Planck:2018vyg}, assuming a scale invariant power spectrum. $A_{\delta_{\psi, \rm{in}}} \simeq 10^{-10}$ enters the non-linear regime around $N_{\rm NL} = 4.5$ and $N_{\rm BBN} = N_{\rm NL} + 2 = 6.5$ (so that there is enough time for the various components to decay before the beginning of BBN, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:Decay}). In this case, Eq.~\eqref{eq:PBHMass} gives $M_{\rm PBH} \simeq 2.4 \times 10^{24} \, \text{g}$, which falls slightly above the sub-lunar mass range ($10^{17} \, {\rm g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$), in which PBHs can still compose $100 \%$ of dark matter~\cite{Carr:2021bzv}. Smaller values of $\beta$, smaller values for the initial amplitude of the perturbations or larger modes would give rise to larger values of $N_{\rm NL}$ and therefore slightly lighter PBHs, which would fall in the sub-lunar mass range. In Fig.~\ref{fig:ParameterSpace} we exhibit the PBH masses that can be obtained in our parameter space.}

Note that the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:MPBH0} gives a maximum value for the mass of the PBHs that can be formed. However, lighter PBHs can also be formed\footnote{The growth takes place for all modes for which  the term proportional to $\omega_{\psi}$ drives the dynamics in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaPsi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:PerturbationDeltaB}.} PBHs with mass around $(10^{15}-10^{16}) \, \text{g}$ would be evaporating today and therefore are severely constrained from observations of the galactic and extra-galactic $\gamma$-rays background~\cite{Carr:2020gox}. Lighter PBHs, in the range $10^9 \, \rm{g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{14} \, \rm{g}$ are subject to milder constraints due to BBN. Light PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15} \, \rm{g}$ are quite interesting from the phenomenological point of view, as they might be a unique probe of the total number of light scalars in the fundamental theory~\cite{Calza:2021czr}, provide a baryogenesis mechanism~\cite{Hooper:2020otu}, reheat the universe~\cite{Lennon:2017tqq, Baldes:2020nuv} and produce GWs in the ultra-high-frequency band~\cite{Anantua:2008am, Dolgov:2011cq, Zagorac:2019ekv}.

Of course, to connect to phenomenology, one has to compute the fraction of PBH dark matter, i.e. $\beta = \rho_{\rm PBH}/\rho_{\rm DM}$, where $\rho_{\rm PBH}$ is the current dark matter energy density in PBHs, while $\rho_{\rm DM}$ is the current total dark matter energy density. Such a computation would require the knowledge of the threshold value $\delta_{\psi, \rm{c}}$ for a sub-Compton spherical overdensity $\delta_\psi$  for it to collapse to a PBH. In turn, computing $\delta_{\psi, \rm{c}}$ requires a careful numerical simulation that we plan to report in future work.

An early pre-BBN epoch of matter domination generically produces early micro- or mini-halos~\cite{ Blinov:2021axd, Barenboim:2021swl} due to the early growth of perturbations on scales below the horizon size. If these micro-halos are stable over cosmological time scale, their annihilation signature at present epoch from the dense galactic center has been studied extensively~\cite{Blanco:2019eij}. But in our case the situation is different: the halos made of $\psi$ particles give away scalar radiation. In fact, it has been shown that scalar radiation from early halos favours PBH formation~\cite{Flores:2020drq}. The remnant halos which do not form PBHs will be destroyed as the $\psi$ particles decay into the radiation bath of the Standard Model particles. So one naively expects that the number density of micro-halos will be very tiny at the present epoch unlike~\cite{Blinov:2021axd}.

\subsection{Gravitational Waves}
\label{sec:GWs}

Scalar perturbations generate GWs at second order in perturbation theory. This effect has been explored in several different contexts, see e.g.~\cite{Baumann:2007zm, Assadullahi:2009nf, Espinosa:2018eve, Kohri:2018awv, Inomata:2020yqv, Inomata:2020tkl, Domenech:2020ssp, Domenech:2021wkk} and~\cite{Domenech:2021ztg} for a recent comprehensive review on the subject. We can expect that this effect is also present in our scenario, as on sub-Compton scales the scalar field perturbations grow following the overdensity in the $\psi$ component~\cite{Amendola:2003wa}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ScalarFieldMode}
\delta\phi_k \simeq \left(\frac{a H}{k}\right)^2 \beta_\psi \Omega_\psi \delta_\psi \,, \qquad \frac{k}{aH} \gg 1 \,.
\end{equation}
In this section we sketch some estimates of the amount of GWs and frequency that one can expect in the scenario described in the previous sections, due to second order scalar perturbations.\footnote{As we will only report order of magnitude estimates, we neglect factors containing the number of degrees of freedom in this section.} We leave a detailed computation of the GW spectrum to a future work and we follow~\cite{Giblin:2014gra, Chatrchyan:2020pzh} to do the estimates. Since we have a multi-component setup, second order scalar perturbations are not the only possible source of GWs. For instance, if the $\psi$ or the background components develop an anisotropic stress-energy tensor due to the rapid growth, they could also source GWs.\\

In order to do some estimates, let us do a few simplifying assumptions. We will assume that most of the GW production occurs at $N_{\rm NL}$, i.e. when the perturbations go non-linear and the scalar field fragments. We also assume that most of the GW energy is deposited in a mode $k_p/a \gtrsim m_\phi$, as it is reasonable to expect from Eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalarFieldMode}: at larger $k$ the scalar field perturbation is suppressed by the prefactor $(aH/k)$, while at lower $k$ the enhancement does not occur at all.\\

First, we would like to understand what is the typical frequency range that is involved. Given Eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalarFieldMode} we would expect that the signal is maximized when $\delta\phi_k$ is maximized. As modes are not amplified at $k/a \lesssim m_\phi$, the GW spectrum features a lower cutoff, given by the mass of the field, namely\footnote{A subscript ‘0’ denotes quantities evaluated at the present time.}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:F0}
f_0 \gtrsim \left(\frac{m_\phi}{10^{-17} \, \rm GeV}\right) \exp\left(N_{\rm NL} - N_{\rm BBN}\right) \times 10^{-3} \, \rm{Hz} \,,
\end{align}
where we have used that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:apa0}
\frac{a_{\rm NL}}{a_0} &= \frac{a_{\rm NL}}{a_{\rm BBN}} \frac{a_{\rm BBN}}{a_{\rm 0}} \simeq \\
&\simeq \exp\left[(N_{\rm NL} - N_{\rm BBN})\right] \times 10^{-10} \times \, \frac{\text{MeV}}{T_{\rm BBN}} \,. \nonumber
\end{align}
Eq.~\eqref{eq:F0} tells us that the signal could cover a large fraction of the GW spectrum depending on the mass $m_\phi \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \rm{GeV}$ of the scalar field. Depending on the amplitude of the GW spectrum, the range of frequencies that is in principle involved could be probed by current and future GW experiments including LISA~\cite{amaroseoane2017laser, Barausse:2020rsu} ($f_0 \sim 10^{-2} \, \rm{Hz}$), DECIGO~\cite{Seto:2001qf} and BBO~\cite{Yagi:2011wg} ($f_0 \sim 1 \, \rm{Hz}$), LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA~\cite{KAGRA:2021kbb}, Einstein Telescope~\cite{Maggiore:2019uih} and Cosmic Explorer~\cite{Evans:2021gyd} ($f_0 \sim 100 \, \rm{Hz}$) and ultra-high-frequency band proposals~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq} ($f_0 \gtrsim 10^3 \, \rm{Hz}$).\\

In order to estimate the amplitude of the GW spectrum let us parametrise\footnote{As in~\cite{Chatrchyan:2020pzh}, we neglect the tensor structure of the perturbation for the purposes of making a basic estimate.} $\Pi^{\rm TT}_{ij} \simeq \alpha \rho_\phi$, where $\Pi^{\rm TT}_{ij}$ is the transverse traceless component of the scalar field stress-energy tensor and $\alpha \lesssim 1$. Then one can write the peak fractional energy density in GWs at production ($N_{\rm NL}$) as~\cite{Chatrchyan:2020pzh}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OmegaGWk}
\Omega_{{\rm GW}, p}(k_p) &\sim \frac{64 \pi^2}{3 M_{Pl}^4 H_{\rm NL}^4} \frac{\rho_{\phi}^2(N_{\rm NL})}{(k_p/(a_{\rm NL} H_{\rm NL}))^2} \frac{\alpha^2}{\lambda} \nonumber \\
& \simeq \frac{192 \pi^2 \, \Omega_\phi^2(N_{\rm NL})}{(k_p/(a_{\rm NL} H_{\rm NL}))^2} \frac{\alpha^2}{\lambda} \,,
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ parametrizes the logritmic width of the signal $\lambda = \Delta \log k$. 
In order to compute $k_p/(a_{\rm NL} H_{\rm NL})$ we impose that the relevant scale is sub-Compton at $N_{\rm NL}$: $\frac{k_p}{a_{\rm NL}} \gtrsim m_\phi$, which implies
\begin{equation}
\frac{k_p}{a_{\rm NL} H_{\rm NL}} \gtrsim \exp\left(\frac{3 N_{\rm NL}}{2}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where we have used that $m_\phi \sim H_{\rm in}$. Using $N_{\rm NL}= 4.5$ from the previous sections, one gets $k_p/(a_{\rm NL} H_{\rm NL}) \gtrsim 850$. Taking $\Omega_\phi(N_{\rm NL}) \simeq5 \times 10^{-3}$ from the numerics of the previous section and $\alpha \sim \lambda \sim 1$ one finds $\Omega_{{\rm GW}, p}(k_p) \simeq 6.5 \times 10^{-8}$.

The current fractional energy density in GWs can be computed by redshifting the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:OmegaGWk} using Eq.~\eqref{eq:apa0}
\begin{align}
\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} (k_p) &= \left(\frac{a_{\rm NL}}{a_0}\right)^4 \frac{\rho_{\rm NL}}{\rho_0} \, \Omega_{{\rm GW}, p} (k_p) \simeq \\
& \simeq 10^{-4} e^{N_{\rm NL} - N_{\rm dec}} \, \Omega_{{\rm GW}, p}(k_p) \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-12} \,, \nonumber
\end{align}
where in the last step we have used the above estimate for $\Omega_{{\rm GW},p}(k_p)$ and $N_{\rm dec} - N_{\rm NL} = 1$.\\

Of course, in order to properly compute the the GW amplitude, we should track the behaviour of $h_k$ all the way through, starting from $N_{\rm NR}$ to the start of the standard radiation domination phase that begins when all the components $b$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ decay. This implies tracking perturbations also when they enter the non-linear regime, which would need a full numerical analysis. In this way one would be able to understand the effects of non-linearities~\cite{Delos:2020mtj, Delos:2019tsl,Delos:2018ueo} ad whether they would enhance the GW spectrum. We plan to further study GW production, including the numerical analysis, in a future work. Nevertheless, an amplitude $\Omega_{{\rm GW}, 0} \simeq 10^{-12}$ can be probed by most of the future GW detectors mentioned above (see~\cite{Thrane:2013oya, Mingarelli:2019mvk} for a detailed discussion).\\

Beyond the GW production mechanisms mentioned above, there are a couple of additional sources related to the formation of light PBHs:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Evaporation of light PBHs~\cite{Anantua:2008am, Dolgov:2011cq}, that produce a GW spectrum with peak at ultra-high-frequency, typically above  $10^{10} \, \rm{Hz}$. In~\cite{Dolgov:2011cq}, the maximum amplitude for the GW spectrum is computed to be $\Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-7}$. In our scenario, it is likely that the maximum amplitude would be slightly smaller, due to an additional period of EMD before the $b$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ components decay.
\item Mergers of PBHs~\cite{Zagorac:2019ekv, Dolgov:2011cq}: in this case the frequency can be estimated as the \textit{Innermost Stable Circular Orbit} (ISCO) frequency, namely
\begin{equation}
f \simeq 10^{15} \, {\rm Hz} \left(\frac{10^{20} \, {\rm g}}{M_{\rm PBH}}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where we have assumed an equal mass for the two merging PBHs. Note that for $M_{\rm PBH} \simeq 10^{20} \, \rm{g}$, which is the relevant mass range for this paper, the ISCO frequency roughly falls into the frequency range that will be accessible with axion experiments~\cite{Ejlli:2019bqj} like ALPS II~\cite{Bahre:2013ywa} and JURA~\cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-nucl-102014-022120}. In order to claim the detectability of such mergers an estimate of the number of expected events at a given distance is needed, that depends on the probability of forming a binary for such light PBHs. We will analyse these points carefully in a future work.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclude}

  The key result of this article is a scenario for fast growth of cosmological perturbations. At first, we present cosmological solutions which asymptote  to a matter dominated era in the early universe (prior to BBN). Density perturbations in this
matter dominated epoch grow very fast, the primary reason for this is a scalar mediated force between dark fermions. Examples with explicit (numerical) computations of the growth exponent have been presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:Perturbations}. The goal of this paper is to present the first
explicit examples, studies of the parameter space of the models and the exploration other related mechanisms for fast growth of perturbations will be carried out in a future work. We also took a phenomenological approach to the  change in the equation of state of the $\psi$ component.  An interesting future direction would be to present a microscopic description of such a transition of the $\psi$ equation of state and study the evolution of the perturbations in the setting. Fast growth of perturbations can potentially have a whole host of interesting phenomenological implications. We have outlined these in the context of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in Sec.~\ref{pheno}. Our estimates indicate that we can obtain PBHs in the sub-lunar window, that can in principle constitute $100\%$ of dark matter. Also, GWs can be expected in a wide range of frequencies, from $10^{-3}$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz, with amplitudes which are in the detectable range with future experiments. Extracting detailed predictions requires analysis which is beyond the scope of the present article. We plan to report on these in subsequent works.

\section{Linearized equations of motion \label{sec:linearized}}

We now turn to the inhomogeneous equations of motion, adding perturbations to the homogeneous quantities discussed in the previous section.  This includes the perturbations of the gauge field, the inflaton and the metric. We start by deriving the linearized equations of motions for all relevant degrees of freedom in Sec.~\ref{sec:setup}, reproducing the results first obtained in Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp}. The helicity basis, introduced in Sec.~\ref{GaugeAndBasis}, proves to be convenient to identify the physical degrees of freedom and simplify the system of equations. This becomes is particularly evident in Sec.~\ref{sec:eom_gauge_fields} which discusses the resulting equations of motion for the pure Yang--Mills sector. We can immediately identify the single enhanced mode and even give an exact analytical expression for the mode function in the limit of constant $\xi$. Finally, Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc} includes also the inflaton and metric tensor fluctuations. {Limitations of the linearized treatment of the perturbations are pointed out in Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc}. They primarily affect the helicity 0 sector and we will return to this point in more detail in Sec.~\ref{subsec:powerspectra}.} The results obtained in Secs.~\ref{sec:setup}, \ref{GaugeAndBasis} and \ref{sec:AllFluc} are in agreement with the findings of Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013nka,Adshead:2013qp,Namba:2013kia}. Any differences in the results can be traced back to the different parameter regime for the background gauge field evolution, see discussion below Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground2}. In addition, we here provide analytical results for the simplified system of Sec.~\ref{sec:eom_gauge_fields}, setting the stage for semi-analytical estimates of the scalar and tensor power spectrum.  Throughout Sec.~\ref{sec:eom_gauge_fields} and \ref{sec:AllFluc}, the parameter $\xi$ is taken to be constant. Its evolution will be considered in Sec.~\ref{sec:example}.



\subsection{Setup for the linearized analysis \label{sec:setup}}

In this section we will derive the system of first-order differential equations for all gauge degrees of freedom and the inflaton fluctuations, assuming a homogeneous and isotropic gauge field background, for further details see App.~\ref{app:fulleom}.

The starting point is the action reported in Eq.~\eqref{eq:action}. We work in the ADM formalism~\cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}, i.e.\ we write the metric as
\begin{equation}
\textrm{d} s^2 = - N^2 \textrm{d} \tau^2 + h_{ij} \left(\textrm{d} x^i + N^i \textrm{d} \tau\right) \, \left(\textrm{d} x^j + N^j \textrm{d} \tau\right) \,.
\end{equation}
We decompose
\begin{equation}
h_{ij} = a^2 \left[\left(1+A\right) \delta_{ij} + \partial_i \partial_j B + \partial_{(i} C_{j)} + \gamma_{ij}\right] \,,
\end{equation}
where $\partial_i C_{i}=0$ and $\gamma_{ij}$ is transverse-traceless, i.e.\ $\gamma_{ii} = \partial_i \gamma_{ij} = 0$. There are four degrees of freedom arising from coordinate reparameterization: two scalar and two vector. In the scalar sector, we impose \textit{spatially flat gauge} which sets
\begin{equation}
A = B = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
In the vector sector, {we choose the gauge in such a way that} $C_i = 0$ (see Eq.~(A.115) of \cite{Baumann:2009ds}), which implies
\begin{equation}
h_{ij} = a^2 \left(\delta_{ij} + \gamma_{ij}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
As we numerically checked that the lapse ($N$) and shift ($N^i$) contributions to the subsequent equations do not affect the results, we discard them in this section\footnote{Hence, we take $N = a$ and $N^i = 0$.} for pedagogical reasons, and we refer to Appendix \ref{app:fulleom} for the complete expressions. 
{Note that the discarded vector $N^i$ contains two physical (but non-radiative) degrees of freedom from the metric.}\\

We expand the gauge fields and the inflaton field as (see also Eqs.~\eqref{eq:background_plus_linear} and \eqref{eq:ansatz-A})
\begin{align}
 A^a_i(\tau, \vec x) & = f(\tau) \, \delta^a_i + \delta A^a_i(\tau, \vec x) \,, \\
 \phi(\tau,x) &  = \langle\phi(\tau)\rangle + \delta \phi (\tau,x) \,,
\end{align}
where $\delta^a_i$ is the Kronecker delta function, $f(\tau) \, \delta^a_i$ and $\langle\phi(\tau)\rangle$ comprise the homogeneous background, while $\delta A^a_i(\tau, \vec x)$ and $\delta \phi(\tau,x)$ denote the quantum fluctuations around the homogeneous background. In order to infer the equations of motion which are linear in the fluctuations, we need to expand the Lagrangian up to quadratic order in all the field fluctuations. To make the computation easy to follow, we split it and the results into various terms arising from $\mathcal{S}_i = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \, \sqrt{-g} \, \mathcal{L}_i$, following Eq.~\eqref{eq:action}. The quadratic terms take the following form:
\begin{align}
 \delta^2 \mathcal{S}_\phi  = & \int \textrm{d}^4 x\, \left[\frac{a^2}{2} \left(\left(\delta \phi'\right)^2  - \left(\partial_i \delta \phi \right)^2 - a^2 V_{,\phi\phi} \left(\delta \phi\right)^2 \right)\right]\,, \\
\delta^2 \mathcal{S}_{\rm YM}  = & \int \textrm{d}^4x \, \left[- \frac{1}{2} \delta A^a_0 \partial_i \partial_i  \delta A^a_0 + \delta A^a_0 \partial_0 \left(\partial_i \delta A^a_i - e f \varepsilon^{abi} \delta A^b_i \right) + \right. \nonumber \\
& + \delta A^a_0 \left(2 e f' \varepsilon^{abi} \delta A^b_i + e f \varepsilon^{abi} \left(\partial_i\delta A^b_0\right) + e^2 f^2 \delta A^a_0\right) - \nonumber \\
& - \frac{1}{2}  \delta A^a_i  \left(\delta A^a_i\right)'' + \frac{1}{2} \delta A^a_j \left(\partial_i \partial_i \delta A^a_j\right) + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_i \delta A^a_i)^2 - \nonumber \\
& - e^2 f^2 \left(\left(\delta A^a_a\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\delta A^b_i\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \delta A^b_i \delta A^i_b \right) - e f \varepsilon^{abc} \left( \delta^b_i \partial_i \delta A^a_k \delta A^c_k + \delta^c_k \partial_i \delta A^a_k \delta A^b_i \right) + \nonumber \\
& + \frac{\left(f'\right)^2 - e^2 f^4}{4} \gamma^{jk} \gamma^{kj} - f' \gamma^{aj} \partial_0 \delta A^{(a}_{j)} - e f^2 \varepsilon^{abc} \gamma^{ij} \left(\delta^b_{(i} \partial_{j)} \delta A^a_{c} - \delta^b_{(i} \partial_{c} \delta A^a_{j)} \right) \bigg] \,,
\label{eq:QuadraticLYMMainText}
\end{align}
 \begin{align}
\delta^2 \mathcal{S}_{\rm CS}  = & \int \textrm{d}^4 x \, \left[-\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \phi \rangle \left(\varepsilon^{ijk} \left(\delta A^a_i\right)' \partial_j \delta A^a_k + 2 e f \left(\delta A^a_{[a}\right)' \delta A^k_{k]} + e f'  \delta A^b_{[b} \delta A^c_{c]}  \right) - \right. \nonumber \\
& \left. - \frac{\alpha}{ \Lambda} \delta \phi \left[f' \varepsilon^{ajk}  \partial_j \delta A^a_k + 2 e f f' \delta A^a_a +  e f^2 \left(\delta A^a_a\right)' -  e f^2 \partial_i \delta A^i_0 \right]\right] \,,
\label{eq:CSQuadraticMainText} \\
\label{eq:EH_to_use}
\delta^2 \mathcal{S}_{EH}  = & \int \textrm{d}^4 x \, \frac{a^2}{2} \left[\frac{ \gamma_{ij} \partial_l \partial_l \gamma_{ij} }{4} + \frac{\gamma^\prime_{ij} \gamma^\prime_{ij}}{4} \right] \,. 
\end{align}

As we will see in Sec. \ref{sec:GCG}, the term proportional to $\delta A^a_0$ in the first line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:QuadraticLYMMainText} vanishes after imposing the generalized Coulomb condition that reads (see Sec.~\ref{sec:GCG} for further details):
\begin{equation}
\partial_i \delta A^a_i - e f \varepsilon^{abi} \delta A^b_i = 0 \,.
\end{equation}

The equation of motion for $\delta A^a_0$ gives Gauss's law, which reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GaussLaw}
0 & = \left(\partial_i \partial_i  - 2 e^2 f^2 \right) \delta A^a_{0} - \left(\partial_i \delta A^a_i - e f \varepsilon^{abi} \delta A^b_i\right) - \nonumber \\
& - 2 e f' \varepsilon^{abi} \delta A^b_i - 2 e f \varepsilon^{abi} \left(\partial_i \delta A^b_0\right) + \frac{\alpha e}{\Lambda} f^2 \delta^{ai} \partial_i \delta \phi \,.
\end{align}

We write the linear equation of motion for the inflaton fluctuations in terms of the variable $(a \delta \phi)$ for later convenience
\begin{align}
0 & = - \left(a \delta \phi\right)'' + \partial_i \partial_i \left(a \delta \phi\right) + \frac{a''}{a} \left(a \delta \phi\right) - 2 \mathcal{H} \left(a \delta \phi\right) + 2 \mathcal{H}^2 \left(a \delta \phi\right) - a^2 V_{,\phi\phi} \left(a \delta \phi\right) - \nonumber \\
& - \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda a} \left[f' \varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j \delta A^i_k + 2 e f f' \delta A^a_a + e f^2 \left(\delta A^a_a\right)' - e f^2 \partial_i \delta A^i_0 \right] \,,
\label{eq:EOMInflatonFluc}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{H} = \frac{a'}{a}$. The linear equations of motion for the dynamical gauge field degrees of freedom are
\begin{align}
0 &= \delta A_i^{a \prime \prime } - \partial_j \partial_j \delta A_i^{a}  + \partial_i \left( -\delta A_0^{a \prime} - \partial_j \delta A^{a}_j \right) + \nonumber \\
& - e \varepsilon^{a b c } \left[ -2 \delta A_0^{b} \delta^c_i f^\prime  + 2 f \delta^b_j \partial_j \delta A_i^{c} + f \delta^c_i  (- \delta A_0^{b \prime} + \partial_j \delta A^{b}_j) - f \delta^b_j \partial_i \delta A_j^{c} \right] - \nonumber \\
& - e^2 f^2 \left[ \delta^a_j \delta^b_j \delta A_i^{b}+ \delta^a_j\delta^b_i \delta A_j^{b}+ \delta^b_j\delta^b_i \delta A_j^{a} - 3 \delta A_i^{a} - 2 \delta^a_i\delta^b_j \delta A_b^{j} \right] - \nonumber \\
& - \frac{\alpha}{2 \Lambda}\left[ \phi^\prime \varepsilon_{ i j k} \left[2 \partial_j A^a_k + 2 e f \varepsilon^{abc} \delta A_j^{b} \delta^c_k\right] + 2 f^\prime \varepsilon^{aji}\partial_j \delta \phi + 2 e f^2 \delta^a_i \delta \phi' \right] - \nonumber \\
& - f'' \gamma^{a}_i + f' \left(\gamma^a_i\right)' + e f^2  \varepsilon^{ajk} \partial_k \gamma_{ij} + e^2 f^3 \gamma^a_{i}  \equiv {\mathbf L}(\delta A,\phi,\gamma)\,,
\label{eq:eom_i_linear}
\end{align}
where for later convenience we have defined the linear operator $\mathbf L$. Finally, we give the equation of motion for the metric fluctuations in terms of the variable $(a \gamma_{ij})$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{a}{4}\left[(a \gamma_{ij})'' + \left(-\partial_l\partial_l - \frac{a''}{a} \right) (a \gamma_{ij})\right] & = \frac{f^{\prime \ 2} - e^2 f^4}{2 a}(a \gamma_{ij} ) - f^\prime \partial_0 \delta A^{(i}_{j)}  + f^\prime \partial_{(i} \delta A^{j)}_0 + \nonumber \\

\label{eq:eomGWs}
\end{align}
{We point out that the right-hand side of this equation is given by the transverse traceless component of the anisotropic energy momentum tensor, and hence this equation is equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations used in gravitational wave physics~\cite{Maggiore:1999vm}. }

\subsection{Choice of gauge and basis \label{GaugeAndBasis}}

In the following we explain our choice of basis for dealing with the gauge field fluctuations, which will greatly simplify the analysis. After introducing the generalization of Coulomb gauge to a non-vanishing gauge field background, we decompose the 12 degrees of freedom of the gauge fields into helicity eigenstates. We further identify the degrees of freedom associated with gauge transformations and constraint equations, leaving us with six physical degrees of freedom. The explicit form of these basis vectors is given in App.~\ref{app:basis}.


\subsubsection{Generalized Coulomb gauge}
\label{sec:GCG}

In Eq.~\eqref{eq:ansatz-A}, we chose a particular representative $(A^{(0)})^a_i=f(\tau)\delta^a_i$ for our homogeneous and isotropic background field.  This is just one representative from the corresponding gauge-equivalence class.  When considering physical fluctuations around this background configuration, we restrict ourselves to fluctuations which are orthogonal to the space spanned by gauge-equivalent configurations
\begin{equation}
 U f(\tau) \delta^a_i \,  U^\dagger + \frac{i}{e} U \partial_i U^\dagger\,, \quad \forall \; U  = \exp(i \xi^a \textbf{T}_a)
 \label{eq:GaugeSpace}
\end{equation}
where $\xi^a$ denotes a infinitesimal gauge transformation parameter.  This condition should apply on each time slice. This orthogonality condition reads
\begin{equation}
 0 = \langle \mathbf{D}_i^{(A^{(0)})} \xi^a \textbf{T}_a | \delta A_i^c \textbf{T}_c \rangle = \text{Tr} \int (\mathbf{D}_i^{(A^{(0)})} \xi^a \textbf{T}_a) \cdot (\delta A_i^c \textbf{T}_c ) \, \textrm{d}^3 \vec{x} \quad \forall \, \xi^a \,,    
 \label{eq:orthogonal}
\end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{D}_\mu^{(A)} \xi^a \textbf{T}_a = \partial_\mu \xi^a \textbf{T}_a - i e [A_\mu^b \textbf{T}_b, \xi^a \textbf{T}_a]
 \label{eq:infinitesimal_gauge}
\end{equation}
denotes the gauge-covariant derivative. After some algebra, Eq.~\eqref{eq:orthogonal} becomes
\begin{equation}
 - \frac{1}{2} \int \xi^a (\partial_i \delta A^a_i + e \varepsilon_{a b c} (A^{(0)})^b_i \, \delta A^c_i )\, \textrm{d}^3 \vec{x}  = 0  \quad \forall \, \xi^a  \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
 D_i^{(A^{(0)})} \delta A^a_i = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
Inserting Eq.~\eqref{eq:ansatz-A} for $A^{(0)}$ we obtain the gauge fixing condition 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{C}(\delta A)^{\, a} \equiv  \partial_i(\delta A^a_i) + e f(\tau) \varepsilon^{a i c}  \delta A^c_i = 0 \,.
 \label{eq:GenCoulombGauge}
\end{equation}
In the following, we will in fact not fix the gauge, but we will choose a basis in which the 6 physical degrees of freedom (obeying Eq.~\eqref{eq:GenCoulombGauge}) and the 3 gauge degrees of freedom (contained in the subspace~\eqref{eq:GaugeSpace}) are explicit and orthogonal. This preserves gauge invariance as a consistency check at any point of the calculation, while clearly separating physical and gauge degrees of freedom. Together with the constraint equation~\eqref{eq:GaussLaw}, this splits the 12 degrees of freedom contained in the $3 \times 4$ matrix $\delta A^a_\mu$ into 6 physical, 3 gauge and 3 non-dynamical degrees of freedom, as expected for a massless  $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory.

\subsubsection{The helicity basis}
\label{sec:helbas}

In the absence of a background gauge field ($f(\tau) = 0$), Eq.~\eqref{eq:action} is invariant under two independent global $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ rotations: one acting on the spatial index and the other acting on the  $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ index of the gauge field $A^a_i(\tau, \vec x)$. In the presence of the background Eq.~\eqref{eq:ansatz-A}, this symmetry is reduced to a single $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetry, which is the diagonal subgroup of $\mathrm{SO}(3)_\text{gauge} \times \mathrm{SO}(3)_\text{spatial}$ (see  \prettyref{app:global-symmetries} for details). The Fourier decomposition introduces a preferred direction $\vec k$, which without loss of generality we will choose to be along the $x$-axis, $\vec k = k \hat e_1$. This breaks the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetry down to an $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of rotations around $\vec k$.  The generator of this symmetry is a helicity operator of massless particles. This generator is given explicitly by\footnote{ The helicity operator can be extended to act on the full $3\times4$ matrix $\delta A$ by defining $\mathbf{H}(\delta  A_0)^a  =  i \varepsilon^{1 c a } \delta A^c_0$.} 
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{H}(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\delta  A}}) & \equiv [\mathbf{T}_1, \overrightarrow{\mathbf{\delta  A}}] + i \hat e_1 \times  \overrightarrow{\mathbf{\delta  A}} \,, \nonumber 
 \\
  \Rightarrow \mathbf{H}(\delta  A)^a_i & = i \varepsilon^{1 c a } \delta A^c_i + i \varepsilon^{i1j} \delta A^a_j  \,,
     \label{eq:helicity_operator}
\end{align}
where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\delta  A}} = \delta A^a_i \mathbf{T}_a$. 
Expressing the linearized system of equations of motion in terms of the linear operator $\mathbf L$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:eom_i_linear}, 
 $\mathbf{L}(\delta A, \delta \phi, \gamma) = 0 $,
the symmetry properties above imply that this linear operator must commute with the helicity operator, $[\mathbf{L}, \mathbf{H} ] = 0$. It will thus be useful to decompose $\delta A$ into helicity eigenstates, which will lead to a block-diagonal structure for $\mathbf{L}$.  This formalism is best known in the context of metric perturbations under the name ``SVT decomposition.''

Let us look at the eigenvalues and multiplicities of these states. With respect to the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group, the $3 \times 3$ matrix {$\delta A$} decomposes as $\mathbf{3} \otimes \mathbf{3} = \mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{5}$: a scalar (S), a vector (V), and a tensor (T). The corresponding helicities are
\begin{equation}
 (S) : 0 \,, \qquad (V) : -1, 0, + 1 \,, \qquad (T) : -2, -1, 0, +1, + 2 \,,
\end{equation}
implying multiplicities 3, 2 and 1 for the helicities $0$, $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ respectively. These nine degrees of freedom correspond to the six physical and three gauge degrees of freedom mentioned in the previous subsection. Since the gauge transformation acts only on the gauge indices and not the spatial indices (see e.g.\ Eq.~\eqref{eq:infinitesimal_gauge}), the three gauge degrees of freedom form a vector (helicities $-1,0,1$). The helicities of the remaining six physical degrees of freedom must thus be $-2, -1 , 0 (\times 2), +1, +2$. Hence in this basis, the linear operator $\mathbf L$ (and hence our equations of motion for $\delta A^a_i$) decomposes into four decoupled equations (for $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$) and two (generically) coupled equations for the two helicity 0 modes. In the following we describe the basis we use for the gauge, constraint and physical degrees of freedom. The corresponding explicit basis vectors can be found in App.~\ref{app:basis}.  In Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc} we will include also the inflaton (helicity 0) and tensor metric (helicity $\pm2$) fluctuations, which will couple to the helicity 0 and $\pm2$ gauge field modes, respectively. 


Let us first consider the pure gauge degrees of freedom, which can be decomposed in terms of  basis vectors $\hat g$  (see Appendix.~\ref{app:basis}) as 
\begin{equation}
 (\delta \tilde{A}^a_\mu)_\text{gauge}(\tau, \vec k) = \sum_b (\hat g_b)^a_\mu w_b^{(g)}(\tau, \vec k) 
 =  \sum_{\lambda}( \hat g_\lambda)^a_\mu \, w^{(g)}_\lambda(\tau, \vec k)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat g_b$ $(b = \{1,2,3\})$ denotes the basis vectors of the gauge degrees of freedom in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ space, $\hat g_\lambda$ with $\lambda = \{-,0,+\}$ denotes the basis vectors in terms of helicity states and we denote the corresponding coefficients by $w_{b}^{(g)}$ and $w_{\lambda}^{(g)}$,
respectively. Introducing a helicity basis for the elements of the Lie algebra, $w_b^{(g)} \mathbf{T}_b = w_\lambda^{(g)} \mathbf{T}_\lambda$, with
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{T}_\pm =  (\mathbf{T}_2 \pm i \mathbf{T}_3)/\sqrt{2} \,, \qquad  \mathbf{T}_0 = \mathbf{T}_1 \,,
\end{equation}
the infinitesimal gauge transformation~\eqref{eq:infinitesimal_gauge}  defines the basis vectors $\hat g^{(g)}_\lambda$,
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{D}_{\mu}^{(A^{(0)})} \left( w_\lambda^{(g)} \mathbf{T}_\lambda \right) = (\hat g_\lambda)^a_\mu w_\lambda^{(g)} \mathbf{T}_a \,.
 \label{eq:gaugebasis0}
\end{equation}
The explicit form of the three basis vectors $\hat g_\lambda$ which satisfy Eqs.~\eqref{eq:gaugebasis0} and are eigenstates of \eqref{eq:helicity_operator} are given in App.~\ref{app:basis}. We note that in  any background which is a fixed point of Eq.~\eqref{eq:symmetry3} (e.g.\ if the background follows the $c_2$-solution), the $k$ and $\tau$ dependence of the basis vectors is fully encoded in $x = - k \tau$ only.



So far, we have considered only the spatial components of $\delta A$. The time components $\delta A_0$ are subject to the constraint equations~\eqref{eq:GaussLaw}. We can solve these explicitly and substitute the solution back into the equation of motion for the spatial components. 
However in practice we will find it more convenient to introduce basis vectors also for these constraint degrees of freedom, extending the differential operator $\mathbf L$ to a differential-algebraic operator. The explicit form of the  corresponding `constraint' basis vectors in the helicity basis is given in App.~\ref{app:basis}.



The remaining eigenspace of the helicity operator~\eqref{eq:helicity_operator} is spanned by the basis vectors of the physical degrees of freedom $\hat e_\lambda$, see App.~\ref{app:basis} for the explicit form.
As anticipated, we find two states with helicity 0, and one state each with helicity $-2, -1, +1, +2$. One can immediately verify explicitly that the basis vectors presented here have the desired qualities, i.e. they are  orthonormal, eigenfunctions of $\mathbf{H}$ with eigenvalues giving the helicity, $\mathbf L(\hat g_\lambda) = 0$ (gauge invariance) and  $\mathbf{C}(\hat e_\lambda) = 0$ (compatibility with generalized Coulomb gauge, see \eqref{eq:GenCoulombGauge}). The choice of basis derived here closely resembles the basis used in Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013nka,Adshead:2013qp,Namba:2013kia}. The main difference is that we explicitly separate the $\pm \lambda$ states and normalize our basis vectors. As we will see in the next section, this simplifies the resulting equations of motion (in particular when considering only the degrees of freedom of the gauge sector).







\subsection{Equations of motion for the gauge field fluctuations}
\label{sec:eom_gauge_fields}

In this section we will compute the equations of motion for the gauge field fluctuations in the canonically normalized helicity basis introduced above (see also App.~\eqref{app:basis}) and discuss their key properties. In Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc} we will extend this to the inflaton and metric tensor fluctuations.

Inserting $\delta A$ in terms of the helicity basis,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:w-lambda-def}
 \delta \tilde{A}^a_\mu(\tau,k) =   \sum_{\lambda}( \hat e_\lambda)^a_\mu \, \frac{ w^{(e)}_\lambda(x) }{\sqrt{2k}} +  \sum_{\lambda}( \hat f_\lambda)^a_\mu \, \frac{ w^{(f)}_\lambda(x) }{\sqrt{2k}} + \sum_{\lambda}( \hat g_\lambda)^a_\mu \, \frac{ w^{(g)}_\lambda(x) }{\sqrt{2k}} \,,
\end{equation}
into the first order equations of motion (see Sec.~\ref{sec:setup} and App.~\ref{app:fulleom}) we  obtain the equations of motions for the coefficients $w^{(i)}_\lambda$ with $i = \{e, f, g \}$ denoting the physical, constraint and gauge degrees of freedom, respectively. Here we have absorbed a factor of $\sqrt{2k}$  (originating from the normalization of the Bunch--Davies vacuum, c.f.\ Eq.~\eqref{eq:BDvac}) into $w_\lambda^{i}$. As we will see below,  for the background solutions of interest, this will render $w^{(i)}_\lambda$ a function of $x = - k \tau$ only. The three equations for the gauge degrees of freedom simply read $0 = 0$, reflecting gauge invariance. For the helicity $\pm2$ modes we obtain
\begin{align*}
\frac{\textrm{d}^2 }{\textrm{d}x^2} w^{(e)}_{-2}(x)+\left(1+\frac{2\xi}{x}+2\left(\frac{\xi}{x}+1\right)y_k(x)\right)w^{(e)}_{-2}(x) & =0\,, \label{eq:-2mode}\\
\frac{\textrm{d}^2}{\textrm{d}x^2}w^{(e)}_{+2}(x) +\left(1-\frac{2\xi}{x}+2\left(\frac{\xi}{x}-1\right)y_k(x)\right)w^{(e)}_{+2}(x) & =0\,,
\label{eq:+2mode}
\end{align*}
with 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:y_definition}
 y_k(x) \equiv \frac{e f(\tau)}{k} \,.
\end{equation}



We can now appreciate some of the advantages of the canonically normalized helicity basis. The equations of motion for the $\pm 2$ modes are fully decoupled, and moreover contain no terms involving the first derivatives $w_\lambda'(x)$. This makes them amenable to WKB analysis. We immediately see that for $\xi \geq 0$ and $y(x) \geq 0$ the $-2$ mode always has a positive effective squared mass, whereas the $+2$ mode can be tachyonic. Consider momentarily the limit where $\xi$ is constant and $f(\tau)$ is one of the three fixed points of the symmetry~\eqref{eq:symmetry3},  $y_k(x) = y(x) = c_i\xi/x$ for some $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, where $c_i$ is defined in \eqref{eq:c-definitions}. In this case, the solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:+2mode} are Whittaker functions:  
 \[ w_{+2}^{(e)}(\tau)= e^{(1+c_{i})\pi\xi/2} W_{-i(1+c_{i})\xi,\,-i\sqrt{2\xi^{2}c_{i}-1/4}}\left(2ik\tau\right) \,,  \label{eq:AnalyticalSolution}  \]  
with the normalization set by the Bunch--Davies vacuum \eqref{eq:BDvac} in the infinite past. For  $c_i=c_0=0$, this solution coincides with the abelian solution, Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_Whittaker}. The region of tachyonic instability for the helicity $+2$ mode as well as some useful approximative expressions for Eq.~\eqref{eq:AnalyticalSolution} will be discussed below.

Next we turn to the $\pm 1$ modes. Here we need to consider the two equations for the dynamical degrees of freedom and two constraint equations. For shorter notation, we introduce two reparameterizations of $y_k(x)$, 
\begin{equation}
y_k(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\tan\theta_{-}(x)-1\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\tan\theta_{+}(x)+1\right).
\end{equation}
with $\theta_\pm \in (- \pi/2, \pi/2)$. With this, the equations for the dynamical and constraint degrees of freedom read
\begin{align}
0 = & \, \frac{\textrm{d} w^{(e)}_{\pm1}(x)}{\textrm{d}x^2} \pm \sqrt{2}  i \sec \theta_{\pm}\left( \tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{\pm}\right) w^{(f)}_{\pm1}(x) \,  + \nonumber \\
& +\left(-\left(\tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{\pm}\right)^{2}+\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1\pm\sin(2\theta_{\pm})\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\mp\frac{\xi}{x}\right)\left(2\cos^{2}\theta_{\pm}\mp\tan\theta_{\pm}\right)\right) w^{(e)}_{\pm1}(x) \,, \nonumber \\
0 = & \, \sec \theta_{\pm} w^{(f)}_{\pm1}(x) \pm 2 \sqrt{2}  i w^{(e)}_{\pm1}(x) \tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{\pm}  \,.
\end{align}
After inserting the constraint equations, this simplifies to
\begin{align}
 \frac{\textrm{d} w^{(e)}_{-1}(x)}{\textrm{d}x^2}+\left(3\left(\tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{-}\right)^{2}+\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1-\sin(2\theta_{-})\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\xi}{x}\right)\left(2\cos^{2}\theta_{-}+\tan\theta_{-}\right)\right)w^{(e)}_{-1}(x) & =0 \nonumber \\
  \frac{\textrm{d} w^{(e)}_{+1}(x)}{\textrm{d}x^2}+\left(3\left(\tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{+}\right)^{2}+\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+\sin(2\theta_{+})\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\xi}{x}\right)\left(2\cos^{2}\theta_{+}-\tan\theta_{+}\right)\right) w^{(e)}_{+1}(x) & =0.
  \label{eq:pm1mode}
\end{align}
For the $c_2$ background attractor solution given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:c2solution}, the resulting effective masses are always positive. We will turn to a more detailed stability analysis in the next subsection. 

Finally let us consider the two helicity zero modes. Since these expressions are somewhat more lengthy, we only give the final expression after substituting the constraint equation
\begin{equation}
 -  \sec^2 \theta_0  w^{(f)}_{0}(x)- \sqrt{2}  \sec \theta_0  \tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{0} w^{(e)}_{02}(x)  = 0\label{eq:0constraint} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced $\theta_0 \in [- \pi/2, \pi/2]$ as
\begin{equation}
 y_k(x)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\tan\theta_{0}(x) \,.
\end{equation}
With this,
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x^2}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  w^{(e)}_{01}(x)\\
 w^{(e)}_{02}(x)
\end{array}\right)+M_{0}(x)\left(\begin{array}{c}
w^{(e)}_{01}(x)\\
w^{(e)}_{02}(x)
\end{array}\right)  = 0
\label{eq:0modes}
\end{equation}
with the $2\times2$ Hermitian mass matrix $M_{0}$ for the two $e_{0i}$ modes given by
\[
M_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1-\sqrt{2}\frac{\xi}{x}\tan\theta_{0}+2\tan^{2}\theta_{0} & -\frac{2i}{\cos\theta_0}\,\left(\frac{\xi}{x}-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\tan\theta_{0}\right)\\
\frac{2i}{\cos\theta_0}\left(\frac{\xi}{x}-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\tan\theta_{0}\right) & \sin^{2}\theta_{0}+\cos^{-2}\theta_{0}-\frac{\xi}{\sqrt{2}x}\sin2\theta_{0}+3\left(\tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{0}\right)^{2}
\end{array}\right)\,.
\label{eq:M0}
\]
{For the background solution of Eq.~\eqref{eq:c2solution} and for $\xi \gg 1$, the off-diagonal elements vanish. Furthermore, on far sub-horizon scales ($x \gg 1$) and far super-horizon scales  $x \ll 1$, the diagonals elements approach unity and $2 \xi^2/x^2$, respectively.}
One may be tempted to diagonalize the general expression of $M_{0}$, but the diagonalization
would be time-dependent and hence re-introduces first-derivatives of $w^{(e)}_{0i}$. {We note that the helicity 0 sector is particularly sensitive to non-linear contributions neglected in our analysis so far, arising from two enhanced helicity $2$ modes coupling to the helicity 0 modes, see also Eq.~\eqref{eq:caveat}. We will discuss this effect in more detail in Sec.~\ref{subsec:powerspectra}.}


In summary and as anticipated, the modes with helicity $\pm 1$ and $\pm2$ form four decoupled harmonic oscillators with the time-dependent mass terms specified in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:-2mode}, \eqref{eq:+2mode} and \eqref{eq:pm1mode}. The two helicity zero modes form  a system of coupled, mass-dependent harmonic oscillators given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:0modes}.



 \subsubsection*{Stability analysis}
 Let us look at these fluctuations in two different background limits (taking $\xi$ to be constant): $f(\tau) \rightarrow 0$ and $e f(\tau) = c_2 \,  \xi/(- \tau)$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:c-definitions}). In the former case, defining $e_{\pm0}(x):=(e_{01}(x)\mp ie_{02}(x))/\sqrt{2}$, the effective squared mass\footnote{Since we are considering ODEs as a function of $x$, $\tfrac{\textrm{d}^2}{\textrm{d}x^2} w(x) + m^2 w(x) = 0$, the `squared mass' is dimensionless quantity.} of $e_{\pm0}$, $e_{\pm1}$, and $e_{\pm2}$ is $1\mp2\xi/x$, so that as in the abelian case, the `$-$' modes are
unenhanced, while the `$+$' modes are enhanced for $x<2\xi$. In this case, the spatial components of the helicity basis simplify to
\begin{equation}
e_{\pm0}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & \pm i\\
0 & \mp i & 1
\end{array}\right),\quad e_{\pm1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & \pm i\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right),\quad e_{\pm2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & \pm i\\
0 & \pm i & -1
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}

 \begin{figure}
 \centering
  \includegraphics{stabilitytensor.pdf}
  \caption{Tachyonic region of the $+2$ mode in a non-abelian, $c_2$-background (shaded in gray). Contrary to the abelian regime, the instability region is bounded from both sides and only affects a single mode. }
  \label{fig:stabilitytensor}
 \end{figure}

On the other hand, for $e f(\tau) = c_2 \,  \xi/(- \tau)$, the squared mass terms appearing in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:-2mode} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:pm1mode} for $w_{-2}^{(e)}(x)$ and $w_{\pm1}^{(e)}(x)$, respectively, are positive for all $x, \xi > 0$. Similarly, the matrix $M_0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:0modes} is positive definite if and only if $\xi > 3/\sqrt{2} \simeq 2.12$, as can be immediately checked from the sign of the trace and the determinant. The instability in the scalar sector for $\xi < 3/\sqrt{2}$ corresponds precisely to the catastrophic instability observed in \cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew} for $m_g > 2 H$, where in our notation $m_g = \sqrt{2} e f(\tau)/a \mapsto \sqrt{2} c_2 \xi H$. Note however that a non-abelian background can only form for $\xi > 2$, and it is likely to form only for $\xi \gg 2$ (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:Isotropic} and in particular Fig.~\ref{fig:u0-of-xi}). Moreover, as we will see in Sec.~\ref{subsec:gaugefluctuations} (see in particular Fig.~\ref{fig:matching}) the transition from the abelian regime to the non-abelian regime occurs at $\xi \gtrsim 3$ for perturbative gauge couplings $e < 0.1$. As a consequence, despite the presence of a potentially dangerous instability  in the scalar sector, the corresponding region of the parameter space is naturally avoided by the mechanism described in this work.



 The only mode which can experience a tachyonic instability in a $c_2$-background is the $e_{+2}$ mode. The mass term for this mode is then given by
\begin{align}
 m_{+2}^2 = 1 - \frac{2 \xi}{x} + \frac{\xi (\xi - x)}{x^2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - 4/\xi^2} \right) \rightarrow 1 - \frac{4 \xi}{x} + \frac{2 \xi^2}{x^2} \,,
 \label{eq:mass-term-2p}
\end{align}
where in the last step we have assumed $\xi \gg 2$.
The region in which this mass term becomes tachyonic is shown as gray shaded region in Fig.~\ref{fig:stabilitytensor} and is given by
\begin{equation}
 x_\text{min} \equiv \left[ 1 + c_2 - \sqrt{1 + c_2^2}\right] \xi < x <  \left[1 + c_2 + \sqrt{1 + c_2^2}\right] \xi  \equiv x_\text{max}\,,
 \label{eq:def-xmin-xmax}
\end{equation}
which for $\xi \gg 2$ yields\footnote{As a word of caution, we note that in particular for small $\xi$, the lower part of this range can come close to the inhomogeneity scale of the initial conditions determined by the abelian regime, cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:propertiesabelian}. In this case, inhomogeneities in the initial conditions may affect the instability band depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:stabilitytensor}.}
\begin{equation}
 \xi (2 - \sqrt{2}) < x < \xi (2 + \sqrt{2}) \,.
\end{equation}


In Fig.~\ref{fig:TensorModeEvolution} we show the evolution of the helicity $+2$ mode in both regimes. The initial conditions are set by imposing the Bunch--Davies vacuum on far sub-horizon scales,
\begin{equation}
 w_{+2}^{(e)}(x) =   e^{i x} \qquad \text{for} \; x \gg 1 \,. \label{eq:BDsimple}
\end{equation}
Note that these solutions are only functions of $x = - k \tau$ and $\xi$. They are in particular independent of the value of the gauge coupling $e$ and the absolute time $\tau$ (although of course the slowly varying value of $\xi$ will introduce an implicit dependence on $\tau$).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Evolution of the helicity $+2$ mode for $\xi = 3$ (left panel) and $\xi = 5$ (right panel). The black curves correspond to the abelian regime ($f(\tau) \simeq 0$), the green curves to the non-abelian regime ($e \, f(\tau) = c_2 \xi /(- \tau)$. }
  \label{fig:TensorModeEvolution}
\end{figure}

{A key observation here is that in the presence of a vanishing or $c_0$-type background solution, the helicity $+2$ mode of the linearized non-abelian theory behaves very much like the enhanced helicity mode of the abelian theory, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Whittakerabelian}. With this in mind, we will refer to the time before the $c_2$-solution develops as the `abelian regime', in contrast to the `non-abelian regime' characterized by the inherently non-abelian effects induced by the  $c_2$-background solution.}


In summary, in the abelian regime ($f(\tau) = 0$), 3 modes become enhanced as soon as $x < 2 \xi$. In the non-abelian regime ($e f(\tau) = c_2 \, \xi/(- \tau)$), only a single mode is enhanced. The enhancement occurs earlier (as soon as $x \lesssim \xi(2 + \sqrt{2})$) compared to the abelian regime  but contrary to the abelian regime only lasts for some finite period of time (for $\Delta x \simeq 2  \sqrt{2} \xi $). As we will see below, these differences lead to a significant changes between the properties of gauge field fluctuations arising in the abelian and non-abelian regime. 
In particular, due to the helicity decomposition, the single enhanced mode of the non-abelian regime can only source (at the linear level) tensor perturbations (i.e.\ gravitational waves) but not scalar perturbations (i.e.\ no curvature perturbations). 

\subsubsection*{Approximate solutions for the enhanced helicity +2 mode}

The tachyonically enhanced modes in the abelian regime have been discussed in much detail in the literature (see Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian}). Here we focus on the enhanced mode in the inherently non-abelian regime, i.e.\ the helicity $+2$ mode in a $c_2$ gauge-field background.  In the limit of constant $\xi$, the exact solution to Eq.~\eqref{eq:+2mode} is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:AnalyticalSolution},\footnote{To leading order in $1/\xi$, this expression agrees with the one given in~\cite{Adshead:2013nka}. The discrepancy at higher orders is due to the different background solution chosen (see also discussion in Sec.~\ref{subsec:dynamical_background}).}
\[
w_{+2}^{(e)}(\tau)= e^{\kappa \pi/2} W_{-i\kappa,\,-i\mu}\left(2ik\tau\right) \,,
\label{eq:whittakeragain}
\]
with $\kappa = (1 + c_2) \xi \simeq 2 \xi$ and $\mu = \xi \sqrt{2 c_2 - (2 \xi)^{-2}} \simeq \sqrt{2} \xi$. For the $c_2$ background solution, we derive useful asymptotic expressions in App.~\ref{app:asymptotics}, approximating the enhanced component of Eq.~\eqref{eq:AnalyticalSolution} on super-horizon scales and around the epoch of maximal enhancement, respectively:
\begin{align}
\, w_{+2} & \simeq 2 e^{(\kappa - \mu) \pi} \sqrt{\frac{ x}{ \mu}} \cos\left[\mu \ln(2 x) + \theta_0 \right]  \qquad  &&\text{for   } x \ll  x_\text{min} \,,
 \label{eq:NonabelianAsymptotics}\\
 w_{+2}(x)& \simeq\sqrt{4\pi}\ e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\left(\frac{\zeta(x)}{V(x)}\right)^{1/4}\mathrm{Ai}\left(\zeta(x)\right) \qquad &&\text{for    } x \simeq x_\text{min} \,,
  \label{eq:NonabelianAsymptotics2}
\end{align}
with Ai$(x)$ denoting the Airy Ai function and
\begin{align}
  V(x)  & =-\left(1-\frac{2\kappa}{x}+\frac{\mu^{2}}{x^{2}}\right) \,, \qquad
\zeta(x)\approx\left(2\mu^{2}-2\kappa x_\text{min}\right)^{1/3}\ln\left(\frac{x}{x_\text{min}}\right) \,.
\label{eq:Airyapp}
 \end{align}
These expressions will prove useful to obtain analytical estimates. For details see App.~\ref{app:asymptotics}.

 
 \subsection{Including the inflaton and gravitational wave fluctuations \label{sec:AllFluc}}
 
With this understanding of the growth of the gauge field fluctuations, let us now include the scalar and metric tensor fluctuations. The former will couple to the helicity 0 gauge field modes, the latter to the helicity $\pm2$ modes. 

Let us start with the helicity 0 modes. After inserting the constraint equation which now reads
\begin{align}
 -    w^{(f)}_{0}(x)- \sqrt{2}  \cos \theta_0  \tfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\theta_{0} w^{(e)}_{02}(x) & = -  \frac{i k \alpha}{\sqrt{2} e \Lambda} \sin \theta^2_0 \delta \phi \,, \label{eq:0constraintphi}
\end{align}
the equations for the dynamical degrees of freedom read
\begin{align}
  \frac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x^2}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  w^{(e)}_{01}(x)\\
 w^{(e)}_{02}(x) \\
 a \delta \phi(x) 
\end{array}\right)
+ N^k_0(x)  \frac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  w^{(e)}_{01}(x)\\
 w^{(e)}_{02}(x) \\
 a \delta \phi(x) 
\end{array}\right) + 
 \tilde M^k_{0}(x)\left(\begin{array}{c}
w^{(e)}_{01}(x)\\
w^{(e)}_{02}(x) \\
 a \delta \phi(x)
\end{array}\right)  = 0\,, \label{eq:fullscalar}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
 N^k_0 & = \frac{\gamma x}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & 0 &  \tan^2 \theta_0 \\
     0 & 0 & - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \sin \theta_0 \tan^2 \theta_0 \\
     - \tan^2 \theta_0 & - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \sin \theta_0 \tan^2 \theta_0  & 0
                                            \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
 \tilde M^k_0 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        \left(M_0\right)_{11} &  \left(M_0\right)_{12}  & \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2}} \tan^2 \theta_0 \\
      \left(M_0\right)_{21}  &
        \left(M_0\right)_{22} 	& -\frac{i \gamma}{2} \left(\sin \theta_0 \tan^2 \theta_0 - 2 x \cos \theta_0 \theta_0'\right) \\
        - \sqrt{2} \gamma x  \frac{\tan \theta_0}{\cos^2 \theta_0} \theta_0' & -\frac{i \gamma x}{16} \frac{\left(15 + \cos\left(4 \theta_0\right) \right)}{\cos^3 \theta_0} \theta_0' & m_{\phi \phi}^2
                     \end{pmatrix},  \label{eq:M0full}         
\end{align}
where $M_0(x)$ is given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:M0}, $\theta_0' = \textrm{d} \theta_0 / \textrm{d}x $, $\gamma = \alpha H  / (e \Lambda) $ and
\begin{equation}
 m_{\phi \phi}^2 = 1 - \frac{2}{x^2} + \frac{\alpha^2 H^2 x^2}{e^2 \Lambda^2} \frac{ \sin^6 \theta_0}{\sin^2\left(2 \theta_0\right)} + \frac{V_{, \phi \phi}}{H^2 x^2	}\,.
 \label{eq:mphi}
\end{equation}
As long as the gauge coupling is not very small, $e \gg \xi H  \alpha/\Lambda$, the coupling between the gauge field modes and the inflaton mode is suppressed around horizon crossing, and the two helicity 0 gauge field modes are to a good approximation described by the unperturbed system~\eqref{eq:0modes}. 
Recalling that $\tan \theta_0/\sqrt{2} = y(x) = e f(\tau)/k$, we note that all off-diagonal terms, including the entire matrix $N_0^k$, vanish in the absence of a background gauge field, $f(\tau) = 0$. In the case of a gauge field background following the $c_2$-solution, $\tan \theta_0/\sqrt{2} = c_2 \, \xi / x$, we note that all off-diagonal terms, including the matrix $N_0^k$, vanish for $x \rightarrow \infty$, i.e.\ in the infinite past, and the matrix $\tilde M_0^k$ reduces to the unit matrix, allowing us to impose Bunch--Davies initial conditions in the infinite past. 
 

In the opposite regime, on far super-horizon scales, the second term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:mphi} is responsible for the freezing out of the $\delta \phi$ fluctuations. In the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 0$, $x \ll1$ and $V_{,\phi\phi} \rightarrow 0$, the equations of motion for $w_0^{(\phi)} = a \, \delta \phi$ simply reads
\begin{equation}
 \left(w_0^{(\phi)}\right)''(x)  - \frac{2}{x^2} \,  w_0^{(\phi)}(x) = 0 \,,
 \label{eq:freezeout}
\end{equation}
with the solution $x \, w_0^{(\phi)}(x) = A x^3 + B $ with the integration constants $A$ and $B$. For $x \rightarrow 0$ this leads to a decaying solution ($A = 1, B = 0$) and a constant solution ($A = 0, B = 1$). This is the usual freeze-out mechanism for scalar (and tensor) fluctuations. Note that the sign in Eq.~\eqref{eq:freezeout} is crucial to obtain a constant solution. {The last two terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:mphi} could in principle interfere with this freeze-out mechanism, however the last term in ensured to be sub-dominant in slow-roll inflation and the second-last term only becomes large together with all the off-diagonal terms, in which case the full coupled system must be analyzed.} {We point out that the freeze-out of the inflaton perturbation, $(a \delta \phi) \propto 1/x$ also entails its decoupling from the helicity 0 gauge field modes on super-horizon scales. }


In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuations} we show the evolution of these helicity 0 modes for a parameter example of the benchmark scenario of the next section. Here $w_0^{(\phi)}$ denotes the coefficient of the comoving scalar mode $(a \, \delta \phi)$. {We clearly see the freeze-out of the inflation fluctuations after horizon crossing. The oscillations visible on sub-horizon are induced by the time-dependence of the eigenstates of the system. We have verified that the sum of the absolute value squared of all three states is $x$-independent as expected in this regime.\footnote{{The time-dependence of these (interacting)  eigenstates induces some ambiguity when imposing the Bunch--Davies initial conditions at any finite value of $x$. We have verified that our final results are not affected by this.}}

\end{figure}


{Our study so far is based on the linearized system of equations given in Sec.~\ref{sec:setup}, which forbids a coupling between the enhanced helicity $+2$ mode and the helicity $0$ modes. To higher orders in $\delta A$, this is no longer true since two tensor modes can combine into a scalar mode. Schematically, e.g.\ a  term bilinear in $A$ in the action can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
 \text{linear: }  f \cdot w_0^{(e)} + h.c. \,, \qquad \text{quadratic: }  |w_{+2}^{(e)}|^2  
 \label{eq:caveat}
\end{equation}
at the linearized level and to next order, respectively. With $\delta A \sim |w_{+2}^{(e)}| \gg |w_{0}^{(e)}|$, the condition $\delta A \ll f(\tau)$ is not sufficient to ensure that the linear term is the dominant one.  
In fact, this observation is well known in the case of abelian axion inflation, where the backreaction of the enhanced gauge fields mode occurs precisely true the $(\delta A)^2 \rightarrow \delta \phi$ process. Generalizing the procedure of Refs.~\cite{Linde:2012bt} (see also \cite{Barnaby:2011qe}) to the non-abelian case, we will estimate the contribution to the scalar power spectrum arising from the non-linear contributions in Sec.~\ref{subsec:powerspectra}.\footnote{{In the abelian limit, these non-linear contributions are also responsible for a friction-type backreaction of the produced gauge fields on the background equation for the inflaton, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion}. On the contrary, in the non-abelian regime (and in particular for the parameter example studied in the next section), the corresponding contribution is subdominant to the gauge field background contribution, given by the last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground}, as long as $\delta A \ll f(\tau)$.}}
}


Next we turn to the helicity $\pm2$ modes, i.e.\ the gravitational waves $\gamma_{ij}$ coupled to the $e_{\pm 2}$ gauge field modes. We express the metric tensor perturbations in the helicity basis as 
\begin{equation}
 a \, \gamma_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\lambda = \pm 2} \frac{w^{(\gamma)}_{\pm 2}(x) }{\sqrt{2k}}\begin{pmatrix}
                                                                    0 & 0 & 0\\
                                                                    0 & \mp i & 1 \\
                                                                    0 & 1 & \pm i
                                                                   \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{equation}
The  equations of motion are then given by
\begin{align}
 \frac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x^2}  \left(\begin{array}{c}
   w^{(e)}_{\pm 2}(x)\\
    w^{(\gamma)}_{\pm 2}(x)  
\end{array}\right)
+ N_{\pm 2}(x)  \frac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  w^{(e)}_{\pm 2}(x)\\
  w^{(\gamma)}_{\pm 2}(x) 
\end{array}\right) + 
  M_{\pm 2}(x)\left(\begin{array}{c}
w^{(e)}_{\pm 2}(x)\\
 w^{(\gamma)}_{\pm 2}(x) 
\end{array}\right)  = 0\,, \label{eq:fulltensor}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
 N_{\pm 2}(x) &  =  \frac{y'(x) H x}{e} \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 & - 1 \\
                   4  & 0
                   \end{pmatrix} \,, \\
M_{\pm 2}(x) & = \begin{pmatrix} 
              1  \mp \frac{2\xi}{x} + 2 (\frac{\xi}{x} \mp 1) y (x)  & \frac{H}{e} \left (-y' (x) - (2\xi \mp x) y (x)^2 + 
      x y (x)^3 \right) \\
                   -\frac{4 H x y (x)^2}{e}  (y (x)\mp 1) & 
                 1 - \frac{2}{x^2} +  \frac{2 H^2 x^2}{e^2} \left( y (x)^4 -  y' (x)^2\right)  
                 \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{align}
where $y' \equiv \tfrac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d}x} y(x) $.
In the large-$\xi$ limit of the $c_2$-solution, $y(x) = \xi/x$, this becomes\footnote{In the following expressions we set $M_P = 1$.}
\begin{align}
 N_{\pm 2}(x) &  =  - \frac{ H \xi }{e x} \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 & -1 \\
                   4  & 0
                   \end{pmatrix} \,, \\
M_{\pm 2}(x) & = \begin{pmatrix} 
               1 \mp 4 \frac{\xi}{x} + 2 \frac{\xi^2}{x^2} & \frac{H \xi}{e x^2} \left( \pm 1 + x \xi \mp \xi^2 \right) \\
              \frac{4 H \xi^2}{e x^2 } \left(\pm x - \xi \right) &
                1 - \frac{2}{x^2}  + \frac{2 H^2 \xi^2}{ e^2 x^2} (-1 + \xi^2)
                 \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{align}
We recognize the tachyonic instability in the $+2$ gauge field mode in the top left entry of $M_{+2}$, leading to an exponential growth for this mode for $(2-\sqrt{2})\xi \leq x \leq (2+\sqrt{2}) \xi$. In the bottom right corner we find the (helicity conserving) mass for the metric tensor mode. Here the first term accounts for the free oscillation on sub-horizon scales, whereas the second term is responsible for the freeze-out on super-horizon scales. The last term is the source term arising from the background gauge field, see the first term on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:eomGWs}, and contributes a positive mass term for $\xi > 2$. Similar to the helicity 0 case discussed above, the system reduces to $N_{\pm2} = 0$ and $M_{\pm2} = \mathbb{1}$ in the far past as $x \rightarrow \infty$. For sub-horizon modes ($x > 1$), the off-diagonal elements are small as long as $e M_P \ll  H$, ensuring that the gauge field modes are well described by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:-2mode} and \eqref{eq:+2mode}. See also the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuations}.

{Finally, let us perform an analytical estimate of the super-horizon amplitude of the enhanced gravitational wave mode in the large-$\xi$ limit. For $x \leq 1$, freeze-out of the gravitational wave implies $w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x) \propto 1/x$ and hence $\tfrac{d^2}{dx^2} w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x) = 2/x^2 w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x)$, thus precisely canceling the second term of the bottom right element of $M_{\pm2}$. For $x \leq 1$, the gauge field mode $w_{+2}^{(e)}$ is well described by the solution~\eqref{eq:NonabelianAsymptotics}, implying that $\overline{(w_{+2}^{(e)})'(x)} \sim 1/x \, \overline{w_{+2}^{(e)}(x)}$ where the bar indicates an averaging over the (co)sine. With this we see that the off-diagonal first derivative term is suppressed by a factor $\xi^2$ compared to the off-diagonal mass term, and the equation of motion for $w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x)$ at $x = 1$ reads
\begin{equation}
   \frac{4 H \xi^3}{e }  w_{+2}^{(e)}(x = 1) \simeq \left(1  + \frac{2 H^2 \xi^4}{ e^2}  \right) w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x = 1) \,.
\end{equation}
If furthermore $H \xi^2 \ll e$, we can immediately obtain the value of the gravitational wave mode at (and beyond) horizon crossing as
\begin{equation}
 x \, w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x) \big|_{x \lesssim 1} = -  \frac{4 H \xi^{3}}{e } w_{+2}^{(e)}(x = 1) \simeq -  \frac{2 H \xi^{5/2}}{e }  2^{3/4} e^{(2 - \sqrt{2}) \pi \xi} \,,
 \label{eq:GWanalytical}
\end{equation}
where in the last step we have inserted Eq.~\eqref{eq:NonabelianAsymptotics}, replacing the cosine with a factor of 1/2. For the parameter point of Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuations} this yields $ \, x \, w_{+2}^{(\gamma)}(x) \big|_{x \lesssim 1} \simeq 3.7 \times 10^3$, agreeing with the full numerical solution up to an order one factor.} We emphasize that due to helicity conservation only one of the two metric tensor modes is enhanced in this manner, resulting in a chiral gravitational wave spectrum. 


 
 In a similar manner, the `freeze-out'-like behaviour visible for the gauge field modes in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuations} can be traced back to the coupling to the metric tensor perturbation through to top-right element of $M_{+ 2}$. {On far super-horizon scales, the contribution from the frozen gravitational wave mode becomes comparable to the contribution from the decaying gauge field modes in the in the equation of motion for the gauge fields. 
 In this regime, the derivative terms are suppressed by a factor of $\xi^{-2}$ compared to the $M_{+2}$ terms.} The amplitude of $w^{(e)}_{+2}$ can then be estimated by comparing the two terms in the first line of $M_{+2}$  to get 
 \begin{equation}
  	w^{(e)}_{+2} (x \rightarrow 0)\simeq \frac{H\xi}{2 e} w^{(\gamma)}_{+2}(x \rightarrow 0)\, ,
  \end{equation} 
 For the parameter point of Fig.~\ref{fig:fluctuations} this yields  $w^{(e)}_{+2} (x \rightarrow 0)\simeq 10^{-2} \, \times \, w^{(\gamma)}_{+2}(x \rightarrow 0) $, in good agreement with the full numerical result.
For the parameter example of this paper, the contribution of the far super-horizon modes to both the energy and variance of the gauge fields is negligible, due to a suppression both in amplitude and momentum compared to the modes crossing the horizon at the same time. Consequently, these are well described by employing the solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:+2mode}. On the other hand, if the gauge coupling is very small, this description is no longer accurate and the gauge and gravity sector need to be treated as a fully coupled system. {In this regime, the gauge field/gravity interactions induce an exchange of energy between the $e_{\pm 2}$ modes and gravitational waves~\cite{Caldwell:2016sut, Caldwell:2017sto}.}

Both the scalar and tensor sector preserve the usual scaling behaviour of de Sitter space. In the limit of constant $H$ and $\xi$, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectrum. The slow variation of $H$ and $\xi$ obtained in any realistic inflation model will lead to deviations from this exact scale invariance. We will discuss this in more detail in the next section.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Oscillons and similar objects have recently gained a considerable amount of attention due to their possible role in the early universe~\cite{1006.3075, 0712.3034, 1004.4658, astro-ph/9311037, 1002.3380, 1009.2505, 1103.1911, 1106.3335,  1710.06851, Antusch:2017vga, 1711.10496,  1902.07261, 1902.06736, Sang:2019ndv}. They are predicted to be formed in many post-inflationary scenarios, affecting the transition from inflation to the standard radiation dominated phase of the early universe. Most importantly, their formation typically leads to the production of gravitational waves with a peculiar spectrum, characterised by a peak centered around the value of the mass of the scalar field involved in the process~\cite{1304.6094, 1607.01314, 1707.09841, 1708.08922, 1803.08047}. Despite this peak being typically located at frequencies much larger than the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA range, if its amplitude is large enough, there is hope that in the future this might be observed, revealing extremely valuable information about the early universe. Furthermore, oscillon-like objects might be relevant to address a number of phenomenologically interesting questions, such as dark matter~\cite{hep-ph/9303313, 1906.06352, 1909.11665, 1909.10805, 1912.07064, Boskovic:2018rub, Ferreira:2017pth, Annulli:2020lyc, Annulli:2020ilw, Khmelnitsky:2013lxt} and baryogenesis~\cite{1408.1811}.

Oscillons are meta-stable solutions for real scalar field theories~\cite{Bogolyubsky:1976yu, hep-ph/9308279, hep-ph/9503217, hep-ph/0209358}. They appear as localised lumps of energy inside which the field oscillates around the minimum of the scalar potential that defines the model. They are meta-stable, i.e. their lifetime is much longer than the oscillation timescale, which is of order $\mathcal{O}(1/m)$, where $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. Oscillon-like objects are known with different names, according to the actual interaction that makes them quasi-stable, see~\cite{1806.04690} for a recent review and a classification of the known compact objects allowed in a scalar field theory. What is traditionally referred to as an oscillon\footnote{Although oscillons were originally named \textit{pulsons}~\cite{Bogolyubsky:1976yu} and then \textit{breathers}~\cite{Segur:1987mg}.} is a compact object whose stability is ensured by the attractive scalar field self-interactions. In order for the model to feature attractive interactions, the scalar potential needs to be \textit{shallower than quadratic}. However, there are other mechanisms to ensure the stability of the oscillon: for instance if gravity plays a role, then the compact object is known as \textit{oscillaton} or \textit{real scalar star}~\cite{gr-qc/0301105, gr-qc/0104093, UrenaLopez:2002gx, UrenaLopez:2012zz}. The are also other variants of the same idea that include two fields, such as \textit{Q-balls}~\cite{Coleman:1985ki} and \textit{boson stars}~\cite{Jetzer:1991jr}, and exploit a global $U(1)$ symmetry to ensure their stability. Oscillon-like objects can also be formed in several non-standard scenarios, see for instance~\cite{hep-th/0610267, 0808.0514, 1210.7568, Antusch:2015ziz, Amin:2013ika, 1809.07724}. In this paper we will generically refer to pseudo-soliton solutions of a real scalar field theory as \textit{oscillons}, regardless of whether gravity plays a role in the meta-stability or not.

Since their discovery, there has been much interest in studying the lifetime and stability of oscillons in different regions of the parameter space spanned by their total mass, and the form of the scalar field potential. Oscillons decay classically by emitting scalar waves, and several works have analytically estimated and numerically computed the oscillon lifetime for various models~\cite{Segur:1987mg, Piette:1997hf, 0812.1919, 0903.0953, 0910.5922, 1003.3459, 1201.1934, 1210.2227, 1612.07750, 1901.06130, 1906.04070, Antusch:2019qrr, 1908.11103, 1911.03340, 2003.10899, Zhang:2020bec}.

\label{fig:Potentials}}
\end{figure}

Our work continues these investigations: while previous studies of oscillon stability typically neglect gravitational effects, these become important in some regions of the parameter space, as already shown in~\cite{1807.09795, 1609.04724, 1708.01344, 1906.09346, 1907.10613, 1912.09658}. In this paper we will be primarily interested in strong gravity effects, which are relevant when the compactness of the oscillon $M/(M_p^2 R)$ (where $M$ is its total mass while $R$ is its radius) is of order $\sim 0.1$ and $\phi/M_p \sim 1$. For many problems with lower compactness (that in scalar field systems typically correspond to small displacements of the field $\phi/M_p \ll 1$), the weak gravity regime is sufficient to describe the dynamics. It has been shown that Newtonian gravity effects may stabilise low-density pseudo-solitons, see for instance~\cite{Hu:2000ke, Marsh:2013ywa, Schive:2014dra, Schive:2014hza, Hui:2016ltb, Marsh:2015wka} for interesting applications to the problem of dark matter.

In this paper we will explore a class of potentials of the form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=\frac{m^2 \Lambda^2}{q}\left[ \left(1+\frac{\phi^2}{\Lambda^2}\right)^{\frac{q}{2}}-1\right] \,,
\label{eq:Potentials}
\end{equation}
that are inspired by axion-monodromy~\cite{0803.3085, McAllister:2014mpa}. These potentials are quadratic around the minimum at $\phi=0$, $m$ being the mass of the scalar field. We will consider three cases which we identify by the value for the parameter $q=-1,0,1$, leading to three different characteristic behaviours of the potential. Note that what we refer to as the $q=0$ case is the limit of the potential for $q \rightarrow 0$ and thus has the logarithmic form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=\frac{m^2 \Lambda^2}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{ \phi^2}{\Lambda^2}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
This range of values for the parameter $q$ ensures that the potential features a region that is shallower than quadratic at $\phi \gtrsim \Lambda$. The scale $\Lambda$ sets the characteristic energy scale of the potential, that determines the transition between the quadratic region and the shallower than quadratic one, see top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Potentials} for a visual comparison in the case $\Lambda/M_p = 1$.

References~\cite{1106.3335, 1906.06352, Zhang:2020bec} note that for the values of the parameter $q$ considered here, the lifetime of the corresponding oscillons is $\tau \gtrsim 6 \times 10^8 \, m^{-1}$ for $q=-1$, $\tau \gtrsim 3 \times 10^7 \, m^{-1}$ for $q=0$ and $\tau \gtrsim 10^8 \, m^{-1}$ for $q = 1$. The analyses performed in~\cite{1106.3335, 1906.06352, Zhang:2020bec} are independent of the actual value of the parameter $\Lambda$: what matters in the absence of gravity - beyond the value of the mass of the field $m$, that sets the characteristic timescale of the system - is the ratio $\phi/\Lambda$. This ratio has to be $\phi/\Lambda \gg 1$ inside the oscillon, in order for the particles to feel the attractive interactions: for $\phi/\Lambda \ll 1$ the potential is well approximated with a quadratic function. However, similarly to what was already observed in~\cite{1906.09346} for different classes of models, we expect that in the class of potentials described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:Potentials}, strong gravity effects become important as soon as $\Lambda$ becomes of order $\mathcal{O}(0.1-1) M_p$, and the objects may undergo collapse to black holes. Therefore in regions where $\phi \sim \Lambda \sim M_p$ both gravity and self-interactions will play a role, resulting in potentially interesting dynamics.

In this article we numerically study the dynamics of oscillons in this regime. Since in this regime we expect the stability of the oscillon configuration to be determined mainly by gravity instead of the attractive scalar field self-interaction, we proceed as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Starting with known free field solutions for the profile of $\phi$ (which would be supported by gravity, and stable in the absence of self-interactions), we investigate how turning on self-interactions affects their stability for the three classes of potential parametrised by $q$, and three different values of $\Lambda$.
\item For comparison, we also investigate whether the free-field solutions will remain stable in the absence of gravity, by setting $G=0$ in our simulations. This tests the importance of the gravitational interaction in stabilizing the localized perturbation in the presence of self-interactions, starting from a free-field solution.
\end{itemize}
It should be noted that the free-field solutions that we use as initial conditions will not, in general, have the same profile as oscillons of the same mass supported by self-interactions alone, or equally for the gravity + self-interactions case. Therefore even if we see a collapse or dispersal, we cannot unambiguously state that no solution exists for this oscillon mass in the relevant regime - we may simply be starting too far away from the correct profile to converge on it. However, it provides an indication that the regime is likely to be unstable. If on the other hand we do not find a prompt collapse or dispersal, we consider that to be a quasi-stable configuration. Our simulations are too short to follow the full lifetime of the oscillon in this case, but we continue them for long enough to see that they are settling into a relatively steady oscillating state, albeit one that is likely to be excited relative to the ground state configuration.

This paper is organised as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:NumericalSetup} we explain the numerical setup, including how we initialise oscillons and the numerical method employed for our study; in Sec.~\ref{sec:ModelsAndResults} we describe our findings for each model that we consider; in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusions} we briefly summarise and discuss the results of the paper.

Throughout this paper we use Planck units with $M_p = \sqrt{\hbar c/8\pi G}$. Our simulations use geometric units in which $G=c=1$ and $m/\hbar = 1$. Therefore lengths and times in our plots are expressed in terms of the scale $1/m$ - the scalar mass is effectively absorbed in the choice of units for length and time.

\section{Numerical Setup}
\label{sec:NumericalSetup}

\subsection{Numerical Methods}
\label{sec:NumericalMethod}

We use $\textsc{GRChombo}$, an open source numerical relativity code, to evolve initial profiles of the scalar field coupled minimally to gravity in full general relativity. This allows us to accurately study oscillon masses right up to and beyond the limits of black hole formation. 
Full details of the GRChombo code can be found at the website~\url{www.grchombo.org}, and also in~\cite{Clough:2015sqa}. 
Briefly, GRChombo evolves the Einstein equation with the BSSN/CCZ4 formulation 
and the method of lines, with 4th order finite difference stencils in space and 4th order Runge-Kutta time integration. To follow black hole formation a moving puncture gauge is employed. This is a dynamical gauge choice which maintains coordinate observers at approximately fixed positions relative to the centre of the domain,
avoiding the focusing in overdense regions which occurs for geodesic observers.

The 3+1D ADM decomposition of the metric reads
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = - \alpha^2 dt^2 + \gamma_{ij} (dx^i + \beta^i dt) (dx^j + \beta^j dt) \,, \label{eq-metric}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the lapse and $\gamma_{ij}$ is the three-metric on the equal time hypersurfaces. In the BSSN formalism the induced metric is further decomposed as 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{ij}=\frac{1}{\chi}\,\tilde\gamma_{ij}\,, \quad \det\tilde\gamma_{ij}=1\,, \quad \chi = \left(\det\gamma_{ij}\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}}  \,.
\label{eq-chi}
\end{equation}
We will frequently present the evolution of $\chi$ as representative of the evolution of the spacetime, with a value of $\chi$ which falls to zero being indicative of black hole formation (which is then confirmed by looking for trapped surfaces).

The simulations we present have spherical symmetry, but GRChombo uses a Cartesian grid. In general we use a coarsest domain of $128^3$ points to represent a region of $L = 128 ~ [1/m]$ with the oscillon at the centre. Using the octant symmetry of the problem in Cartesian coordinates (coming from the spherical symmetry of the setup) we only actually need to evolve 1/8th of the volume ($64^3$ points), with reflective boundary conditions in the negative x, y and z directions which take into account the appropriate parity of the gravitational components in each direction. We enforce four additional 2:1 refinement levels on top of this, which is sufficient to resolve non collapsing cases. However, we add additional refinement dynamically in order to keep the fields well resolved, which is activated during any collapse to a black hole. This refinement is driven by the gradients in $\chi$. We present the some code validation checks in Appendix \ref{sec-convergence}.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}
\label{sec:InitialConditions}

Meta-stable solutions for the real free scalar field case can be numerically obtained by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) equations for a scalar field profile with the ansatz of a harmonic time dependence, see for example~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx, 1609.04724}. In that case, a shooting method is used to construct a one-parameter family of meta-stable solutions, characterised by the maximum amplitude of the scalar field at the centre of the oscillon, denoted by $\phi_0/M_p$, or equivalently by their total mass $M$, usually expressed in units $[M_p^2/m]$ (see table Tab.~\ref{tab:1to1Relation} for the conversion). These meta-stable solutions can be further characterised as \textit{stable} under small perturbations, if $\phi_0/M_p < 0.48$, and unstable under small perturbations, if $\phi_0/M_p > 0.48$.  

As noted in the Introduction, we will use the field profiles of solutions that are stable under small perturbations in the free-field case as initial conditions for our simulations, as described below. (Note that we parameterise these in terms of the mass $M$ since this is still a relevant physical quantity when the potential includes self-interactions, whereas the peak amplitude of the oscillation $\phi_0$ is likely to change beyond the free-field case.)

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
$\phi_0 ~ [M_p]$ & $M ~ [M_p^2/m]$ \\ \hline
$0.10$ & $2.07$ \\ \hline
$0.20$ & $2.63$ \\ \hline
$0.30$ & $2.90$ \\ \hline
$0.40$ & $3.01$ \\ \hline
$0.48$ & $3.04$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{One-to-one relation between the value of the maximum central amplitude of the free-field oscillon and its total mass. We characterise our initial conditions in terms of the total mass of the oscillon, as the resulting amplitude may differ under evolution in the non linear potential. \label{tab:1to1Relation}}
\end{table}

In models with a more complicated scalar potential it is not straightforward to solve the EKG equations to find meta-stable solutions and their stability limits, hence in this paper we use the free-field solutions as approximate guesses, and test whether they evolve into stable solutions or disperse/collapse once self-interactions are included. When the potential is close to the simple massive case (cases for which $\Lambda \gg M_p$), the profiles will remain constant and the same stability bounds will be obtained, but for the strongly attractive interactions studied here $\Lambda \lesssim M_p$ and $\phi \gtrsim \Lambda$, we expect potentially significant deviations in both the profile and the stability.
To be able to use the free-field solutions with an arbitrary potential, we pick the point of time symmetry in which
\begin{equation}
\phi(r) = 0 \,, \qquad \dot\phi(r) \neq 0 \,.
\end{equation}
In this way, the momentum constraint\footnote{$K_{ij}$ and $K$ are the extrinsic curvature and its trace respectively, while $D_j$ is the covariant derivative with respect to $\gamma_{ij}$.}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_i = D_i K - D^j K_{ij} - 8 \pi S_i = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
is trivially satisfied because the gradients of the field vanish everywhere, thus the momentum density $S_i = \gamma_{ia} \gamma_{jb} T^{ab} \sim \dot\phi(r) \partial_i \phi = 0$ ($T^{ab}$ is the stress-energy tensor). At the same time, the only additional terms in the Hamiltonian constraint\footnote{Where $\rho$ is the energy density and ${}^{(3)} R$ is the $3$-curvature.}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = {}^{(3)} R + K^2 + K_{ij} K^{ij} - 16 \pi \rho = 0 \,, \label{eqn-Ham}
\end{equation}
with respect to the free-field case are the potential terms beyond $\frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2$, but those vanish because $\phi(r) = 0$ everywhere. Hence, given the solutions for the free-field case (which we obtained using a shooting method) the Hamiltonian constraint is satisfied at this point of time symmetry, and we can use the free-field solution as the initial condition for our simulations without violating the constraints. This leads to a non trivial profile for the field time derivative $\Pi \sim \dot \phi$, and the lapse $\alpha$ and conformal factor of the metric $\chi$, as defined in equations (\ref{eq-metric}) and (\ref{eq-chi}) above. The initial solutions for $\Pi$ are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi}, from which we see that more massive solutions are more compact with a higher central amplitude in the field and a smaller spatial extent. The spatial metric is chosen initially to be conformally flat, so the numerically obtained solutions in areal polar coordinates are transformed into conformally flat ones and then interpolated onto the numerical grid using a first order scheme. 

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{velocity.pdf}
\caption{Spatial profiles of the initial condition for the conjugate momentum $\Pi = \frac{1}{\alpha}(\dot\phi - \beta^i \partial_i \phi)$ of the field, for different total masses of the oscillon $M$. \label{fig:pi}}
\end{figure}

As noted above, despite these solutions being meta-stable in the free-field case, they do not necessarily maintain this property once interactions are taken into account, and so they may be poor initial guesses for stable configurations. However, it was observed in~\cite{1906.09346} that if a meta-stable solution exists for the models considered, and if it is not too far from the free-field meta-stable solution, then the initial conditions that we use here tend to be dynamically driven towards the new meta-stable solutions. We effectively start with an ``excited'' state of the true solution, and the additional excitations are radiated over a transient period.
This is the behaviour that we observe in most examples in this paper, see Sec.~\ref{sec:ModelsAndResults}. However, we also find some unexpected instabilities, which may be at least partly due to the initial conditions being too far from the meta-stable solutions to converge on them. This is discussed further below.

\section{Models and Results}
\label{sec:ModelsAndResults}

As detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction}, we study the class of potentials described in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Potentials}. For each of the 3 values of the parameter $q$, we set the initial profile of the oscillon to the free-field, gravitationally supported solution, according to the procedure described in Sec.~\ref{sec:InitialConditions}, with 5 different values of the total mass $M$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:1to1Relation}). For each of these values, we simulate the subsequent dynamics once self-interactions are turned on, firstly including gravity and then removing gravitational support by setting the gravitational constant $G = 0$, and fixing the background as Minkowski space. We explore the differences in the evolution, noting whether the result is a collapse, dispersion, or meta-stability. 
We also explore 3 different energy scales for the self-interaction term $\Lambda/M_p = 0.1,~ 0.3,~ 1.0$. Above the upper limit of this range we find that the behaviour and solutions tend to that of the free-field case. Below the lower limit the impact of the potential on the gravitational field becomes negligible and the behaviour approaches that of a massless scalar field.
For each choice of the parameter $q$ we display the resulting dynamics in a table, denoting by MS the cases that feature a meta-stable solution at the end of the simulation, by D the cases that disperse during the simulation and by C the cases that lead to a collapse, namely to black hole formation. Furthermore, we show the time evolution of the scalar field $\phi_0$ and of the conformal factor $\chi$ at the centre of the oscillon for several interesting cases.

\subsection{Case $q = -1$}
\label{sec:qminus1}

The potential takes the form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = m^2 \Lambda^2 \left[1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{ \phi^2}{\Lambda^2}}} \right] \,.
\end{equation}
The dynamics for the case $q = -1$ are summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:qminus1}, with the full numerical results given in Appendix \ref{app:qminus1}.

\end{table}

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{q_m1.pdf}
\caption[caption]{Field dynamics in the case $q=-1$, $\Lambda/M_p = 1$. The left column refers to the field at the centre of the oscillon in Planck units $\phi/M_p$, while the right column of plots refers to the conformal factor $\chi$ at the centre of the oscillon. We find that only the first value of $M=2.07 \, M_p$ gives a meta-stable solution. The remaining cases collapse to black holes due to the effect of the additional attractive self-interactions. \label{fig:qminus1} \footnotemark}
 \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Throughout the paper we use brown lines for cases which include gravity, and orange for
non-gravity cases. We also use a shaded background to highlight those that collapse to black holes in the gravity case.}
Fig.~\ref{fig:qminus1} shows the central field and conformal factor profiles in the case $\Lambda/M_p = 1.0$, $M \geq 2.07 \, M_p^2/m$. Recall that the conformal factor dropping to zero signals the formation of a horizon, thus we see that the three higher mass cases all result in collapse to a black hole, with only the first being meta-stable. When gravitational support is removed, all these cases disperse, indicating that the self-interaction alone is not sufficient to support the configuration, which is expected since in this case $\phi < \Lambda$.

This is therefore a clear case where taking into account the effects of both gravity and self-interactions might drastically change the resulting dynamics and stability of oscillons in the model. We see that adding the attractive interactions, whilst stabilising oscillons in smaller amplitude cases, results in lower stability than a purely massive potential in the strong gravity regime. This can be understood by considering the potential gradient in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Potentials} and the dynamics of the central value of the field, where
\begin{equation}
    \ddot \phi \sim \nabla^2 \phi - \frac{dV}{d\phi}.
\end{equation}
We see that a flatter potential results in a {\it smaller} restoring force, and thus large excursions of the field on the potential have a tendency to destabilise the free-field configuration, leading to its collapse. There is, in effect, too much attraction when both gravity and the self-interaction are included.

For the cases with $\Lambda/M_p = 0.1$ and $\Lambda/M_p = 0.3$ all values appear to be meta-stable. In these cases the value of $V(\phi)$ is smaller for the same amplitude of the field and so the gravitational effects are weaker - the combination of attractive self-interactions and gravitational attraction seems to find a stable balance. The field radiates energy during the first oscillations and settles into an excited but meta-stable state. This is true both in the cases that include gravity and in the cases with $G = 0$ where gravity is neglected. The main difference between these two regimes is in the amplitude of the oscillations - as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qminus01} gravity makes them somewhat larger. As discussed for instance in~\cite{Antusch:2017vga}, as soon as the assumption about spherical symmetry is relaxed, a larger amplitude of the field inside the oscillon might lead to a larger GW production in a scenario in which these oscillons are produced after preheating. 

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

The left column refers to the field at the centre of the configuration $\phi$, while the right column refers to the conformal factor $\chi$ at the same point. For smaller values of $\Lambda$ we find a meta stable oscillon both with and without gravity for all the values that we tested, once self-interactions are added. \label{fig:qminus01}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Case $q = 0$}
\label{sec:q0}

In this case the potential features a logarithmic dependence on the scalar field
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=\frac{m^2 \Lambda^2}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{ \phi^2}{\Lambda^2}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
The behaviour is summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:q0}, with the full numerical results given in Appendix \ref{app:q0}, where we see that the dynamics is more complicated in this case. We observe three different behaviours for the three choices of $\Lambda/M_p$

\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of the stability of the initial configuration in the case $q=0$.\label{tab:q0}}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 1$ we observe a behaviour similar to the case $q=-1$ described in Sec.~\ref{sec:qminus1}, where there is a prompt collapse to a black hole above $M \geq 2.07 \, M_p^2/m$, whilst the initial profile always disperses if the effects of gravity are neglected, see Fig.~\ref{fig:q0Lambda1}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.93]{q0_m1.pdf}
\caption{As in Fig. \ref{fig:qminus1}, but for the case $q=0$, $\Lambda/M_p=1$. Again we see that there is a transition between stability and collapse above $M = 2.07\, M_p^2/m$, meaning that the configuration is less stable than the purely massive case. We also plot the cases without gravity, where we see that the field disperses - self-interactions are too weak to support the configuration alone where $\phi < \Lambda$. (Note that we cut the plots at the point where we no longer trust the dispersed cases due to large boundary reflections, but run the $G=1$ case longer to confirm stability for $M = 2.07 M_p^2 / m$.)}
\label{fig:q0Lambda1}
\end{figure}

\item At the other end of the scale, for $\Lambda/M_p = 0.1$, while neglecting the effects of gravity we always get meta-stable solutions (as might be expected since here $\phi > \Lambda$), the cases with both gravity and self-interactions can lead to black hole formation, see Fig.~\ref{fig:q0}. 
The fact that for intermediate values of the total initial mass ($2.63 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 2.90 \, M_p^2/m$) we have black hole formation, while for greater values of $M$ ($M \geq 3.01 \, M_p^2/m$) we have again meta-stable oscillon states, is a rather surprising behaviour. We ascribe this peculiar feature to the sub-optimal initial conditions that we are using. As explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:InitialConditions}, using the free-field solutions as initial conditions does not guarantee that the perturbation is close enough to the actual meta-stable state (once interactions are taken into account) so that the latter is dynamically reached by the system. It might well be that, for some combination of the parameters that we are considering, the free-field solution is sufficiently different that we cannot reach it by dynamical evolution. This seems to be the main reason for the irregular behaviour that we are observing in these models, in which there is no clear boundary in parameter space between the collapse region and the meta-stable one. We note that a similar qualitative behaviour was observed in~\cite{1708.01344} for the case of axion stars with a cosine potential. The instability in this regime merits further investigation, and motivates the search for more accurate analytic initial conditions.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.93]{q0_m01.pdf}
\caption{Field dynamics in the case $q=0$, $\Lambda/M_p=0.1$. The left column refers to the field $\phi$ at the centre of the configuration, while the right column refers to the conformal factor $\chi$ at the centre of the oscillon. In this case we unexpectedly see a recovery in stability for the larger mass case, whilst smaller mass cases collapse to black holes. As discussed in the text, this may be due to the initial conditions being too far from stable solutions to converge on them dynamically. In the zero gravity case all cases are meta-stable.
\label{fig:q0}}
\end{figure}

\item For the intermediate case of $\Lambda/M_p = 0.3$ we see a behaviour similar to $\Lambda/M_p = 0.1$, except that if we only have self-interactions and no gravity, then the field profile quickly disperses. This is due to the fact that the field mainly probes the quadratic part of the potential, hence the attractive force is smaller and insufficient to keep the perturbation localised. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case $q=1$}
\label{sec:q1}

The potential in this case takes the form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi)=m^2\Lambda^2\left[\sqrt{1+\frac{ \phi^2}{\Lambda^2}} -1\right] \,.
\end{equation}
The dynamics in this case are summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:q1}, with the full numerical results given in Appendix \ref{app:q1}, where we see a behaviour similar to the $q=0$ case

\label{tab:q1}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the case $\Lambda/M_p = 0.1$ we observe the behaviour shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:q1Lambda01}. In the absence of gravity the solution is always meta-stable - self-interactions are sufficient to support the profile, while with both self-interactions and gravity the profile collapses to a black hole for all cases above $M \geq 2.63 \, M_p^2/m$.

\item For $\Lambda/M_p = 0.3$ the solutions always disperse with $G=0$, as the field mainly probes the quadratic part of the potential. On the other hand, the solution collapses to a black hole when $G=1$ and the initial total mass of the oscillon takes intermediate values $2.6 \, M_p^2/m \leq M \leq 3 \, M_p^2/m$. It appears to restabilise at the highest mass, which we attribute to the same reasons described in the $q=0$ case above.

\item For the case $\Lambda/M_p = 1$, we find collapse to a black hole for cases above mass $M \geq 2.6 \, M_p^2/m$. On the other hand, the profile always disperses if the effects of gravity are neglected, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:q1Lambda1}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this paper we expanded the studies in~\cite{1906.09346} to a wider class of potentials, tracking stability in different regions of the parameter space of the potential and configuration mass. We focused on axion-monodromy inspired models, whose potential takes the form in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Potentials}. We provide an analysis that is complementary to the one presented in~\cite{Zhang:2020bec}, covering regions of the parameter space where general relativity effects become important. We confirm the expectation that when the characteristic scale of the scalar potential is comparable to the Planck mass $\Lambda \approx M_p$ and the field probes the region $\phi \gtrsim \Lambda \sim M_p$, then the inclusion of general relativity effects becomes crucial in order to successfully study the dynamics of the system. We show in Fig. \ref{fig:fieldprofiles} field profiles of $\Pi$ to illustrate the dynamics. In particular, in this work, we have observed that
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spherically symmetric localized perturbations of scalar field, that cannot be supported by self-interactions alone, may be made stable by the addition of gravitational effects, see for instance the case $\Lambda/M_p = 1.0$, $M = 2.07 \, M_p^2/m$;
    \item Too much attraction can be a bad thing for stability - in some cases the interplay between gravitational attraction and self-interactions destabilises the perturbation, leading it to collapse to a black hole. This may happen in cases where the solution with $G=0$ gives rise to a meta-stable state (see for instance the case $q=0$, $\Lambda/M_p=0.1$, $M = 2.63 \, M_p^2/m$) and if the solution with $G=0$ disperses (see for instance the case $q=0$, $\Lambda/M_p = 0.3$, $M = 2.90 \, M_p^2/m$). As a general rule adding attractive self-interactions makes perturbations less stable than the free-field case;
    \item Using the initial conditions that we have chosen, we do not observe a sharp transition from the region in which oscillons are stable and the region in which they collapse to a black hole, which is similar to the findings in~\cite{Michel:2018nzt}. We ascribe this behaviour to the fact that the initial conditions that we using are the stable solutions for the free-field case (as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:InitialConditions}), which may be too far from any stable solutions in the modified potential to evolve dynamically towards them.
\end{itemize}
Given the last point, one could improve the study by updating the numerical shooting method used to find stable solutions to explicitly include the impact of self-interactions to some perturbative order, in order to start closer to the ``true'' solutions.

\caption{Field profiles for cases with $M = 2.07 \, M_p^2/m$. The left panel shows the profiles in the case  $\Lambda=1 ~M_p$ for each of the three values of $q$ at a later time in the simulation.  The right panel shows a series of snapshots of the profile over time for the case $\Lambda=0.1 ~M_p$, $q=0$ with gravity. The attractive self-interactions result in a more peaked profile compared to the free-field case ($\nabla^2 \phi$ must be larger to balance the attractive self-interactions), which is most pronounced for the flattest potential - the $q=-1$ case. In the cases with $\Lambda=0.1 ~M_p$ where the amplitude of the oscillons strongly probes the flat part of the potential the profiles are somewhat ``messy''; they are initially in a superposition of excited states with different frequencies, which should decay away over time to leave the most stable ground state. \label{fig:fieldprofiles}}
\end{figure} 
 
As the dynamics of oscillons studied in this paper is potentially relevant in the early Universe, it would also be interesting to extend the numerical analysis to the formation of these compact objects starting from vacuum fluctuations, or a more general power spectrum, after inflation. Such a study, including the effects of general relativity, would be relevant where significant overdensities develop which may collapse to black holes. Less challenging technically would be to generalise the analysis in this paper to multi-field and non-spherically symmetric scenarios, to see how these changes may affect the stability of compact objects. We plan to address these open questions in the near future.

\section{Appendix: Code validation and convergence}
\label{sec-convergence}

To check convergence we perform the simulations with base resolutions for the half-box of $N=32^3$ (LR), $N=64^3$ (MR) and $N=128^3$ (HR), with the middle case corresponding to the results presented. In each case four 2:1 refinement levels are enforced to ensure that the initial oscillon is well resolved, and additional levels are added dynamically if collapse to a black hole occurs. 

We check that for the key quantities extracted at the centre of the grid, like the field $\phi$ and the conformal factor of the spatial metric $\chi$, numerical errors are not significant in the plots we present - see the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig-converge} for the actual values plotted at all three resolutions - we find that the differences are not visible to the naked eye. 

Our numerical integration scheme is between 3rd and 4th order accurate, but the results are dominated by the first order error from the interpolation of the numerical solutions onto the initial grid and our so convergence results are consistent with this, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig-converge}. In future we plan to use a better interpolation scheme to improve the quality of the results.

We test convergence in all the cases either side of criticality - that is, in the highest mass case for which the oscillon is meta-stable, and in the lowest mass case for which a black hole is formed. In the cases where the solutions transitioned between stable and unstable at several masses, we performed additional checks and increased the (half) grid size from $L=64\, [1/m]$ to $L=128 \,[1/m]$ to check for boundary effects but found no evidence for errors of this kind affecting the outcomes.

\caption{Convergence test related to the case $q=1$, $\Lambda/M_p=1.$, $M = 2.63 \, M_p^2/m$.  The low resolution error is the absolute difference between the MR and LR values of the field at the centre of the grid, whereas the high resolution error is the absolute difference between the values at this point in the HR and MR cases. The first order convergence observed is consistent with the error introduced by the interpolation of our numerical solutions onto the initial grid. The ``first order convergence'' line is obtained by multiplying the high resolution error by a factor of 2, corresponding to the doubling in resolution, and should match (approximately) the magnitude of the low resolution error. In these plots we use the raw simulation time, which is in units of [1/m] and corresponds to the time measured by observers far from the oscillon.}
\label{fig-converge}
\end{figure}

We check that the Hamiltonian constraint violation in the simulations is reasonable in comparison to the typical energy density scale of the problem, and remains bounded with increasing resolution, as shown for two example cases in Fig. \ref{fig-ham}. The figure plotted is $|\mathcal{H}|/ |H_0|$ where (as in Eq. \eqref{eqn-Ham}) the Hamiltonian constraint is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{H} = {}^{(3)} R + K^2 + K_{ij} K^{ij} - 16 \pi \rho = 0 ~ .
\end{equation}
The norm $|\mathcal{H}|$ is taken as the volume integral of the absolute values of the Hamiltonian constraint over the portion of the grid within a coordinate distance of $r = 32$ [1/m] from the central point. In cases where a BH forms we excise the region within any horizon that forms when taking the integral, as it is known that large violations occur at the numerical BH ``puncture''. Such errors do not propagate outside of the horizon due to the causal structure of the spacetime. 

Since the value of the Hamiltonian constraint should be zero, a percentage error is not well defined. However, to give a guide as to how serious it is, one can compare it to the sum of the absolute values of the individual terms which occur in the Hamiltonian constraint (a kind of sum of total energy and curvature densities), thus we define
\begin{equation}
	H = |{}^{(3)} R | + K^2 + K_{ij} K^{ij} + 16 \pi \rho ~ ,
\end{equation}
with $H_0$ the initial value at $t=0$. The norm is taken over the same region as for $\mathcal{H}$ and therefore the quantity plotted $|\mathcal{H}|/ |H_0|$ can be roughly thought of as quantifying the error in the constraint in this region, relative to the initial total energy density.

The CCZ4 scheme is used to damp constraints, leading to an overall decrease over time in meta-stable cases. In the collapsing case there is a growth in the constraint violation as the BH forms (partly due to regridding errors in the MR and LR cases) but this stabilises after the horizon forms, and converges away with increasing resolution.

Whilst not clearly visible in Fig. \ref{fig-ham}, all resolutions start with approximately the same level of violation, at around 1-3\%. The value arises due to finite errors introduced by the conversion from areal polar to conformally flat initial data. This process involves integration of the areal polar data from a larger outer radius ($r=1000$ [1/m]) where the oscillon energy density is assumed to be negligible, inwards to the centre. It turns out that this process is highly sensitive to the small residual value of the field at this point, and so introduces the 1-3\% error which is then inherent in the data interpolated onto the grid. As such, whilst increasing the resolution reduces the gradient approximation error, this absolute error is not reduced (and thus the initial error does not always reduce). This initial error also creates a spike in the relative violation to around 3-5\% as it propagates out of the central region and crosses regridding boundaries, which is larger where the initial violation is larger. Given that the error remains relatively small throughout the simulations, that we get consistent results at all resolutions tested, and that we use the CCZ4 scheme to damp the error over time, we are confident that this does not affect our results. Nevertheless, in future investigations, we plan to directly interpolate the areal polar coordinate values, and adjust our gauge conditions to account for the non zero initial conformal flatness (which in their current form would introduce gauge artefacts).

\section{Basis vectors for the gauge fields in the helicity basis \label{app:basis} }


In this appendix we collect the explicit forms of the basis vectors derived in Sec.~\ref{GaugeAndBasis}. The six physical degrees of freedom are spanned by the helicity states $\hat e_\lambda$,
\begin{equation*}
 (\hat e_{01})^{b}{}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\  0 &0 & 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}  \,,  \quad 
 (\hat e_{02})^{b}{}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 4 y_k(x)^2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 2 i y_k(x) & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
 \end{pmatrix} \,,\nonumber \\
 \end{equation*}
 
 \begin{align}
 (\hat  e_{-1})^{b}{}_{\mu} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 4 y_k(x) + 4 y_k(x)^2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & i(1 + y_k(x)) & 1 + y_k(x) \\ 0 &  i y_k(x) & 0 & 0 \\ 0 &  y_k(x) & 0 & 0 
 \end{pmatrix} \,,
   \nonumber \\
 (\hat e_{+1})^{b}{}_{\mu} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 - 4 y_k(x) + 4 y_k(x)^2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
0 &   0 & -i(1 - y_k(x))  & 1 - y_k(x) \\ 0 & i y_k(x) & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & - y_k(x) & 0 & 0

 \end{pmatrix} \,,
 \quad
 (\hat e_{+2})^{b}{}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -i & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & i 
 \end{pmatrix}  \,,
 \label{eq:basis}
\end{align}
with $y_k(x) \equiv e f(\tau)/k$. Note that in any background which is a fixed point of Eq.~\eqref{eq:symmetry3} (e.g.\ if the background follows the $c_2$-solution), we can drop the index $k$ on $y_k(x)$ as this quantity becomes a function of $(- k \tau)$ only: $y_k(x) = e k^{-1} f(- k^{-1} x) = e f(-x) \equiv y(x)$.

The gauge degrees of freedom (simultaneously satisfying Eqs.~\eqref{eq:gaugebasis0} and \eqref{eq:helicity_operator}) read
\begin{align*}
\left(\hat g_{-1}\right)^{b}{}_{\mu} & =\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & -y_k(x) & i\,y_k(x)\\
i\,\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x} & (1+y_k(x)) & 0 & 0\\
\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x} & -i(1+y_k(x)) & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\,,\\
\left(\hat g_{0}\right)^{b}{}_{\mu} & =\left(\begin{array}{cccc}

-\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x} & i(1-y_k(x) & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right) \,,
\end{align*}
where the entry $\textrm{d}/\textrm{d}x$ indicates that the corresponding coefficient $w_\lambda^{(g)}(x)$ is replaced by $\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x} w_\lambda^{(g)}(x)$. 

Finally the  basis vectors encoding the constraint equations (Gauss' law) are given by
\begin{align*}

\section{Introduction}

Two crucial quantities of any string compactification are the Hubble scale during inflation $H$ and the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. The first sets the inflationary energy scale $M_{\rm inf}\sim \sqrt{H M_P}$ which in turn is related to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ as $M_{\rm inf}\sim M_{\rm GUT}\left(\frac{r}{0.1}\right)^{1/4}$, whereas the second gives the order of magnitude of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}$. Given that neither primordial tensor modes nor supersymmetric particles have been detected yet, experimental data yield just upper and lower bounds on these two quantities: 
\begin{eqnarray}
r&\lesssim& 0.1 \qquad\quad\,\Rightarrow \qquad H \lesssim \frac{M_{\rm GUT}^2}{M_P} \sim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV} \label{rbound} \\
M_{\rm soft}&\gtrsim& 1\,{\rm TeV}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad m_{3/2}\gtrsim 1\,{\rm TeV}\,. \label{Msoftbound}
\end{eqnarray}
However $H$ and $m_{3/2}$ are not two independent quantities since in any consistent string inflationary model the inflaton dynamics has not to destabilise the volume mode. This is guaranteed if the inflationary energy is smaller than the energy barrier to decompactification, i.e. $H^2 M_P^2 \lesssim V_{\rm barrier}$, and the height of the barrier is generically set by the gravitino mass. In KKLT models $V_{\rm barrier}\sim m_{3/2}^2 M_P^2$ which leads to $H\lesssim m_{3/2}$ \cite{Kallosh:2004yh} while in the LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) $V_{\rm barrier}\sim m_{3/2}^3 M_P$ giving $H\lesssim m_{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}}$ \cite{Conlon:2008cj}.

These theoretical bounds are not in contradiction with the experimental bounds (\ref{rbound}) and (\ref{Msoftbound}), in particular for the cases of high-scale supersymmetry and small field inflationary models with unobservable tensor modes. However the phenomenologically interesting cases of low-energy supersymmetry with $M_{\rm soft}\gtrsim {O}(1)$ TeV and large field inflationary models with $r\gtrsim {O}(0.01)$ would imply a high value of $H$ together with a small value of $m_{3/2}$, in clear tension with the theoretical bounds from volume destabilisation problems.

Several ideas have been proposed in the literature to overcome this tension between TeV-scale supersymmetry and large field inflation. Here we briefly summarise them:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The relation $H^2 M_P^2\lesssim V_{\rm barrier}$ would be independent on $m_{3/2}$ in models where the energy barrier and the gravitino mass are two uncorrelated quantities. Racetrack superpotentials provide viable models where $V_{\rm barrier}$ is decoupled from $m_{3/2}$ \cite{Kallosh:2004yh}.

\item The KKLT bound $H\lesssim m_{3/2}$ and the LVS bound $H\lesssim m_{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}}$ apply just to the inflationary era, and so in these expression $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass during inflation which might be different from the present value of the gravitino mass. This is possible if $m_{3/2}= e^{K/2} |W| \simeq \frac{W_0}{{V}} M_P$ evolves just after the end of inflation. Two viable realisations include inflationary models where the inflaton coincides with the volume mode ${V}$ so that ${V}$ relaxes from small to large values during inflation \cite{Conlon:2008cj} or where the inflaton is a complex structure modulus or a matter field so that $W$ relaxes from large to small values during inflation \cite{He:2010uk}. Another option is to consider models with two different volume stabilisation mechanisms during and after inflation. If ${V}$ couples to the field $X$ whose F-term drives inflation, the volume's vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation would be determined by the F-term potential of $X$ which however vanishes after the end of inflation when ${V}$ is fixed by a more standard KKLT or LVS mechanism. This kind of models with a K\"ahler potential coupling between ${V}$ and $X$ have been studied in \cite{Antusch:2011wu} whereas superpotential interactions between ${V}$ and $X$ have been analysed in \cite{Yamada:2012tj}.

\item Another possible way-out to reconcile low-energy supersymmetry with high scale inflation is to consider models where the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of supersymmetry breaking so that the soft terms are much smaller than the gravitino mass \cite{Seq}. This can be the case for compactifications where the visible sector is localised on fractional D3-branes at singularities which can lead to $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}$.
\end{enumerate} 

Let us point out that all the solutions listed above require a high degree of tuning except for the sequestered case which might be however not enough to completely remove all the tension between observable tensor modes and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Moreover, it is technically rather complicated to provide consistent string models where these solutions are explicitly realised. Therefore they are at the moment at the level of string-inspired toy-models without a concrete string embedding where one can check if there is enough freedom to achieve the amount of fine tuning needed to reproduce all the desired phenomenological details.

In this paper we shall provide a first step towards an explicit stringy embedding of the case where the volume mode plays the r\^ole of the inflaton evolving from small to large values after the end of inflation \cite{Conlon:2008cj}. We will describe a possible microscopic origin of the potential terms used in \cite{Conlon:2008cj} to create an inflection point at small volumes around which slow-roll inflation can occur. Moreover, we shall also perform a deeper analysis of the relation between the positions of the inflection point and the minimum with the tuning of the flux superpotential.

Before presenting the details of our analysis, let us stress some key-features of the model under study:
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to have an evolving gravitino mass, we focus on models where the inflaton is the volume mode ${V}$. Given that we work in an effective supergravity theory where the K\"ahler potential has a logarithmic dependence on ${V}$, each term in the inflationary potential will be a negative exponential of the canonically normalised volume mode $\Phi\sim \ln{V}$, i.e. $V \supset e^{- k \Phi}$. This form of the potential is reminiscent of Starobinsky-like models which have a rather large inflationary scale since they are at the boarder between large and small field models \cite{Starobinsky:1980te}. However Starobinsky-like potentials feature also an inflaton-independent constant which can never appear in cases where the inflaton is the volume mode ${V}$ since ${V}$ couples to all sources of energy because of the Weyl rescaling needed to obtain the correct effective action.\footnote{Starobinsky-like models with large $r$ and a constant inflaton-independent constant can instead be obtained in models where the inflaton is a K\"ahler modulus different from the volume mode \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}.}

\item The best way to achieve volume inflation is therefore to consider a potential which has enough tuning freedom to create an inflection point and then realise inflation in the vicinity of the inflection point. The price to pay is that this inflationary scenario turns out to be rather fine tuned and it is necessarily a small field model with a sub-Planckian field range during inflation $\Delta\Phi\sim 0.4 \,M_P$, unobservable tensor modes of order $r\sim 10^{-9}$ and low Hubble scale $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. Hence this approach cannot solve completely the tension between large tensor modes and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Still it provides a big step forward especially if combined with a sequestered visible sector so that low-energy supersymmetry can be safely reconciled with a high gravitino mass.

\item In LVS models where $H> m_{3/2} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}}$ and the inflaton is the volume mode, the destabilisation problem of \cite{Kallosh:2004yh} becomes an overshooting problem since the inflaton has an initial energy which is larger than the barrier to decompactification. The solution to this problem via radiation production after the end of inflation has already been discussed in \cite{Conlon:2008cj}, and so we shall not dwell on this issue. 

\item In the models under study, the Hubble scale during inflation is set by the gravitino mass during inflation $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}$ which is much larger than the gravitino mass today $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}$ due to the volume evolution. Hence the Hubble scale $H$ can be much larger than $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}$ since we have:
\begin{equation}
H \sim m_{3/2}^{\rm inf} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}}{W_0\,M_P}} \gg m_{3/2}^{\rm today} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}^{\rm today}}{W_0\,M_P}}\,.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
We shall analyse both the single modulus and the two moduli case focusing on three different visible sector realisations which lead to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{High-scale SUSY models}: in this case the requirement of low-energy supersymmetry is abandoned and the value of the gravitino mass both during and after inflation is huge. The volume mode evolves from values of order $100$ during inflation to values of order $200$ after the end of inflation. The flux superpotential has to be tuned to values of order $W_0\sim 10^{-5}$ in order to reproduce the correct amplitude of the density perturbations. Thus the order of magnitude of the gravitino mass during and after inflation is the same, $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10^{11}$ GeV corresponding to $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. Due to the small value of ${V}$, in this case the validity of the effective field theory approach is not fully under control.

\item \textit{Non-sequestered models}: in these models during inflation the volume is of order ${V} \sim 10^5$ and $W_0\sim 1$ giving a gravitino mass of order $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim 10^{14}$ GeV which leads again to $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. After the end of inflation the volume evolves to ${V}\sim 10^{15}$ as required to get TeV-scale supersymmetry since the present value of the gravitino mass becomes $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10$ TeV \cite{Conlon:2005ki}.

\item \textit{Sequestered models}: in these models inflection point volume inflation takes place again for values of order ${V} \sim 10^5$ and $W_0\sim 1$ which yield $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim 10^{14}$ GeV and $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. After the end of inflation the volume evolves instead to ${V}\sim 10^7$ corresponding to $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10^{11}$ GeV, as required to get low-energy supersymmetry gaugino masses in sequestered scenarios where $M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}\sim 10$ TeV \cite{Seq}. 
\end{enumerate}

This paper is organised as follows. Sec. \ref{SecIPInf} is a brief review of the basic concepts of inflection point inflation which will be used in the rest of the paper while in Sec. \ref{SecOrigin} we describe a possible microscopic origin of all the terms in the inflationary potential which are needed to develop an inflection point at small values of ${V}$ together with a dS minimum at larger values of the volume mode. In Sec. \ref{SecSingle} we study the single modulus case presenting first an analytical qualitative description of the inflationary dynamics and then performing an exact numerical analysis. The two moduli case typical of LVS models is instead discussed in Sec. \ref{SecTwo} before presenting our conclusions in Sec. \ref{SecConcl}.


\section{Inflection point inflation}
\label{SecIPInf}

In this section we briefly review the generic features of inflection point inflation, closely following  \cite{Baumann:2007ah} and \cite{Linde:2007jn}. We summarise the main points and discuss the tuning involved in these models.

The basic assumption is that inflation takes place around an inflection point along some arbitrary direction in field space. The scalar potential around such an inflection point can always be expanded as:
\begin{equation}
V = V_{\rm ip} \left(1+ \lambda_1 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})+ \frac{\lambda_3}{3!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^3+\frac{\lambda_4}{4!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^4+\dots\right),
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\rm ip}$ denotes the position of the inflection point. Given that we shall focus on cases where the field excursion during the inflationary period is small, i.e. $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$, the quartic term can be safely neglected. We therefore find that it suffices to analyse the following potential:
\begin{equation}
V = V_{\rm ip} \left(1+ \lambda_1 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip}) + \frac{\lambda_3}{3!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^3\right).
\label{appr}
\end{equation}
The inflationary observables are determined by the slow-roll parameters:
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon &=& \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{V'}{V}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\lambda_1 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda_3 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^2\right)^2\simeq \frac{1}{2}\lambda_1^2\,, 
\label{eps} \\
\eta &=& \frac{V''}{V} = \lambda_3 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\,,
\label{eq:srParams}
\end{eqnarray}
which have to be evaluated at horizon exit where $\phi=\phi_*$. Note that in (\ref{eps}) and (\ref{eq:srParams}) we approximated $V \simeq V_{\rm ip}$ in the denominator, which is a good approximation for small field models where $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$. Notice that if $\lambda_3\gtrsim 1$ this small field condition has to be satisfied in order to obtain $\eta\ll 1$. If instead $\lambda_3$ is tuned such that $\lambda_3\ll 1$, the condition $\eta\ll 1$ could be satisfied also for large field values but then the approximation (\ref{appr}) would be under control only by tuning all the coefficients of the expansion. We shall therefore focus only on the case $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$. The number of e-foldings is given by:
\begin{equation} 
N_e(\phi_*) = \int_{\phi_{\rm end}}^{\phi} \frac{d \phi}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_3}} 
\arctan \left.\left[\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_3}{2\lambda_1}}(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\right]\right|_{\phi_{\rm end}}^{\phi_*}\,.
\label{Ne}
\end{equation}
In order to have enough e-foldings we need $\lambda_1\ll 1$, which is also needed to get $\epsilon\ll 1$, and $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\gtrsim \sqrt{\lambda_1}$ so that the arctangent does not give a small number. Thus the slow-roll parameter $\eta$ turns out to be larger than $\epsilon$ since:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon\sim \lambda_1^2 \ll \eta \sim (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\gtrsim \sqrt{\lambda_1}\ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore the spectral index in these models is essentially given by $\eta$:
\begin{equation}
n_s - 1 = 2 \eta(\phi_*) - 6 \epsilon(\phi_*) \simeq 2 \eta(\phi_*)\,,
\end{equation}
By using (\ref{Ne}), it is possible to rewrite the spectral index as a function of the number of e-foldings as: 
\begin{equation}
n_s - 1 \simeq - \frac{4}{N_e} + \frac 23 \lambda_1\lambda_3 N_e\,.
\label{eq:ns}
\end{equation}
Since $1 - \frac{4}{N_e} \simeq 0.93$ for $N_e\simeq 60$, it is evident that for a very small $\lambda_1$ (or equivalently a very flat inflection point) the spectral index asymptotes to $0.93$. We have therefore to use (\ref{eq:ns}) to determine the value of $\lambda_1$ that gives a value of $n_s$ in agreement with recent Planck data, i.e. $n_s = 0.9655\pm 0.0062$ ($68\%$ CL) \cite{Ade:2015lrj}. We find:
\begin{equation}
n_s=0.965 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \lambda_1=7.92\cdot 10^{-4}\,\lambda_3^{-1}\qquad\text{for}\qquad N_e=60\,.
\label{correctns}
\end{equation}
In these small field models, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ turns out to be unobservable since:
\begin{equation}
r= 16 \epsilon \simeq 8\lambda_1^2 \simeq 5.01\cdot 10^{-6} \lambda_3^{-2}\qquad\text{for}\qquad N_e=60.
\label{r}
\end{equation}
Successful inflation not only gives rise to the correct spectral tilt and tensor fraction but does so at the right energy scale. The normalisation of scalar density perturbations in these models can be written as: 
\begin{equation}
\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \left.\frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\phi_*} \simeq \frac{1}{12 \pi^2} \frac{V_{\rm ip}}{\lambda_1^2} \simeq 2.4 \cdot 10^{-9}\,.
\label{cobe}
\end{equation}
Once the parameter $\lambda_3$ is fixed, (\ref{correctns}) gives the value of $\lambda_1$ which produces the correct spectral index, $n_s=0.965$, and (\ref{cobe}) fixes the value of $V_{\rm ip}$ which reproduces the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. In turn, (\ref{r}) yields the prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. 


\section{Microscopic origin of the inflationary potential}
\label{SecOrigin}

In this section we will try to describe a possible microscopic origin of volume modulus inflation focusing on tree-level effects first, and then including any subleading effect which breaks the no-scale structure typical of type IIB constructions. 

\subsection{Tree-level effective potential}
\label{sec:pot}

The closed string moduli content of the low-energy supergravity limit of type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau $X$ can be summarised as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dilaton $S = s + {\rm i} C_0$
\item Complex structure moduli $U_\alpha$ ($\alpha = 1, \dots, h^{1,2}(X)$)
\item K\"ahler moduli $T_i = \tau_i + {\rm i} c_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, h^{1,1}(X)$)
\end{itemize}
where $C_0$ and $c_i$ are axion fields, while $U_\alpha$ are complex functions. It is worth recalling that the VEV of the real part of the dilaton sets the string coupling: $\langle s\rangle = 1/g_s$.

The effective field theory is completely determined by the K\"ahler potential, the superpotential and the gauge kinetic functions. While the gauge kinetic functions are model-dependent, a generic feature of type IIB compactifications is the form of the tree-level K\"ahler potential:
\begin{equation}
K_{\rm tree} = - 2 \ln{V} - \ln\left(S + \overline{S}\right) - \ln\left(i \int_X \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}\right).
\label{leadingKP}
\end{equation}
Turning on background fluxes induces the Gukow-Vafa-Witten superpotential \cite{Gukov:1999ya}:
\begin{equation}
W_0(U,S) = \int_X G_3 \wedge \Omega\,,
\end{equation}
where $G_3 = F_3 + i S H_3$ and $\Omega$ is the holomorphic 3-form of $X$. $W_0(U,S)$ depends on the dilaton through $G_3$ and it is also a function of the complex structure moduli since $\Omega$ depends on $U_\alpha$.

In general the scalar potential in supergravity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
V = e^K \left[K^{a \bar{b}} D_a W D_{\bar{b}} \overline{W} - 3 |W|^2 \right],
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ run over all the moduli of the compactification and the K\"ahler covariant derivative is defined as $D_a W\equiv\partial_a W+ W \partial_a K$. The particular dependence of \eqref{leadingKP} on ${V}$ is such that the scalar potential obeys the \textit{no-scale structure}, namely:
\begin{equation}
K^{i \bar{j}} \partial_i K \partial_{\bar{j}} K =  3 \,,
\end{equation}
with $i$ and $j$ running over the K\"ahler moduli. Due to the no-scale structure and the fact that $W_0(U,S)$ does not depend on the $T$-moduli, the scalar potential simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
V = e^K K^{\alpha \bar{\beta}} D_\alpha W D_{\bar{\beta}} \overline{W}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ now run over the complex structure moduli and the dilaton. It is positive definite, so that $U_\alpha$ and $S$ can be stabilised supersymmetrically at:
\begin{equation}
D_S W_0(U,S) = 0 \qquad\text{and}\qquad D_{U_{\alpha}} W_0(U,S) = 0\,,
\label{sustabilisation}
\end{equation}
while the K\"ahler moduli remain unstabilised at this order of approximation.

\subsection{No-scale breaking effects}

In this section we will consider the complex structure and the dilaton stabilised at leading order as in \eqref{sustabilisation}, and we will introduce new effects to stabilise the K\"ahler moduli by breaking the no-scale structure. In particular we will consider two explicit setups:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] \textit{Single modulus case} \\
In this setup we have a single K\"ahler modulus $T_b = \tau_b + {\rm i} c_b$ where $c_b$ is an axion field and $\tau_b$ controls the overall volume: ${V} = \tau_b^{3/2}$. The canonical normalisation of the inflaton field $\tau_b$ can be inferred from its kinetic terms: 
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac{3}{4 \tau_b^2} \partial^\mu \tau_b \partial_\mu \tau_b\,,
\end{equation}
so that the canonically normalised volume field can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \ln \tau_b \simeq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \ln {V}\,.
\label{CanNorm}
\end{equation}
In this setup the visible sector can be realised in two different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping the 4-cycle associated to $\tau_b$. Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is set by $\tau_b$ as $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}=\tau_b$, the late-time value of the volume has to be of order $100$ in order to reproduce a correct phenomenological value of $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}\simeq 25$. This model is characterised by high scale SUSY.

\item[ii)] The visible sector is localised on D3-branes at singularities obtained by collapsing a blow-up mode to zero size due to D-term stabilisation \cite{Seq}. In this case the visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, and so the volume can take much larger values of order ${V} \simeq 10^7$ which lead to TeV-scale supersymmetry via sequestering effects. In the presence of desequestering perturbative or non-perturbative effects \cite{Conlon:2010ji}, low-energy SUSY requires larger values of ${V}$ of order ${V}\sim 10^{14}$.
\end{itemize}

\item[b)] \textit{Two moduli case}\\
In this setup we start with two K\"ahler moduli: $T_b = \tau_b + {\rm i} c_b$ and $T_s = \tau_s + {\rm i} c_s$ with $\tau_b \gg \tau_s$. The Calabi-Yau volume takes the Swiss-Cheese form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \tau_b^{3/2} - \tau_s^{3/2}\,.
\end{equation} 
The modulus which plays the role of the inflaton will still be $\tau_b$, and so its canonical normalisation is given by (\ref{CanNorm}). 
However, in this setup the visible sector can be realised in three different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping $\tau_b$ (for an explicit Calabi-Yau construction see \cite{Cicoli:2011qg}). As explained above, in this case ${V}$ has to be of order $100$ for phenomenological reasons and the SUSY scale is very high.

\item[ii)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping $\tau_s$ (see again \cite{Cicoli:2011qg} for an explicit model). Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is now independent on $\tau_b$ since $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}=\tau_s$, the volume can take large values. A particularly interesting value is ${V}\simeq 10^{14}$ which leads to TeV-scale soft terms, as in standard non-sequestered LVS models. 

\item[iii)] The visible sector is localised on D3-branes at singularities (see \cite{ExplSeq} for explicit global dS models) obtained by collapsing a blow-up mode to zero size due to D-term stabilisation. Since the gauge kinetic function of D3-branes is given by $S$, ${V}$ can take large values. Due to sequestering effects, in this case TeV-scale superpartners require ${V}\simeq 10^7$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{$\alpha'$ corrections}

If $W_0\neq 0$, the no-scale structure is broken by $\alpha'^3$-corrections which show up in the K\"ahler potential in the following way \cite{Becker:2002nn}:
\begin{equation}
K \supset - 2 \ln\left({V} + \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\right)\simeq -2\ln{V} - \frac{\hat\xi}{{V}}\quad\Rightarrow\quad K_{\alpha'} = -\frac{\hat\xi}{{V}}\,,
\label{alphaprimeKP}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\xi} = \xi s^{3/2}$. Note that this correction causes a mixing between the K\"aler moduli and the dilaton which produces a small shift in the dilaton VEV of order $D_S W_0(U,S) \sim {O}\left({V}^{-1}\right)$.
The contribution of this $\alpha'$ correction to the scalar potential looks like: 
\begin{equation}
V = e^K \left(K^{T_b \bar{T}_b} D_{T_b} W D_{\bar{T}_b} \overline{W} - 3 |W|^2 \right) \supset V_0 \,e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} \equiv V_{\alpha'}\,,
\label{Va}
\end{equation}
where we have defined:
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \frac{3 \hat{\xi} |W_0|^2}{4}\,.
\label{eq:V0}
\end{equation}
$V_0$ is a free parameter which can be tuned to get inflection point inflation with the right COBE normalisation and a large volume minimum.


\subsubsection{Non-perturbative effects}

Given that non-perturbative effects are exponentially suppressed, they tend to give rise to negligible contributions to the scalar potential. However, in the two moduli case, $T_s$-dependent non-perturbative effects could lead to potentially large contributions. In this case the superpotential becomes \cite{Kachru:2003aw}:
\begin{equation}
W = W_0 + A_s(U,S)\, e^{- a_s T_s}\,,
\label{LVSsuperpot}
\end{equation}
where $A_s(U,S)$ is an unknown function of the dilaton and the $U$-moduli. Given that these moduli have already been stabilised at leading order, $A_s$ can be considered as an ${O}(1)$ constant. The parameter $a_s$ is given by $a_s = 2 \pi/N$, where $N$ is the number of D-branes wrapping the small cycle where the non-perturbative effect is generated.

The new effect in (\ref{LVSsuperpot}) breaks the no-scale structure by producing two terms in the scalar potential which allow to stabilise the K\"ahler moduli by competing with the $\alpha'^3$ effect (\ref{Va}). This stabilisation mechanism is at the basis of the so-called Large Volume Scenario \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}. Given that $\tau_s$ turns out to be much heavier than $\tau_b$, it can be integrated out in order to get effectively a scalar potential which depends only on $\tau_b$.

The LVS potential takes the form:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left(\frac{8  a_s^2 A_s^2 \sqrt{\tau_s} e^{-2 a_s \tau_s}}{3 {V}} - \frac{4 W_0 a_s A_s \tau_s e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{{V}^2} + \frac{3 \hat{\xi} W_0^2}{4 {V}^3}\right).
\label{eq:LVS}
\end{equation}
Minimising with respect to $\tau_s$, we get at leading order in the $a_s \tau_s \sim \ln {V}$ expansion:
\begin{equation}
e^{-a_s \tau_s} \simeq \frac{3 W_0 \sqrt{\tau_s}}{4 a_s A_s {V}}\,.
\end{equation} 
Plugging this expression into (\ref{eq:LVS}) we get an effective potential which depends only on the volume ${V}$:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{V_0}{{V}^3} \left[1 - \frac{2}{\hat\xi a_s^{3/2}} \left(\ln {V}\right)^{3/2}\right]\,.
\label{effectivepotentialLVS}
\end{equation}
The first term in (\ref{effectivepotentialLVS}) is just the $\alpha'$ correction (\ref{Va}) whereas the second term leads to a new non-perturbative contribution to the scalar potential:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm np} = - \kappa_{\rm np} V_0 \,\Phi^{3/2}\,e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} \qquad\text{with}\qquad 
\kappa_{\rm np}=\frac{2}{\xi}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi^2}\right)^{3/4}\left(g_s N\right)^{3/2}\,.
\label{Vnp}
\end{equation}
Note that $\kappa_{\rm np}$ is another parameter that can be tuned to get inflection point inflation with the right COBE normalisation and number of e-foldings.


\subsubsection{Higher derivative $\alpha'$ corrections}

Additional contributions to the scalar potential from higher derivative corrections to the 10D action have been computed in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. These corrections have the same higher dimensional origin as the $\alpha'^3$-term (\ref{Va}). Both stem from the $\alpha'^3 {R}^4$ contribution to the in 10D type IIB action. The effect of these four derivative corrections is to modify the equations of motion of the auxiliary fields (F-terms) thereby giving rise to corrections to the kinetic terms, new quartic derivative couplings and more importantly new contributions to the scalar potential.  These $F^4$ corrections depend on the Calabi-Yau topology and take the generic form:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} = - \frac{\hat{\lambda} |W_0|^4}{{V}^4} \Pi_i t^i\,,
\label{v1}
\end{equation}
where $\Pi_i$ are topological integers defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_i = \int_X c_2 \wedge \hat{D}_i\,,
\end{equation}
with $c_2$ the second Chern class of the Calabi-Yau $X$ and $\hat{D}_i$ is a basis of harmonic $(1,1)$-forms allowing for the usual expansion of the K\"ahler form $J$ as:
\begin{equation}
J = \sum_{i=1}^{h_{1,1}} t_i \hat{D}_i\,,
\end{equation}
with $t^i$ being 2-cycle volumes. The parameter $\hat{\lambda}$ is expected to be of order $\hat{\xi}/\chi(X)$, with $\chi(X)$ being the Calabi-Yau Euler number. For model building purposes, we will take it to be a real negative constant.

Depending on the details of the compactification space, these new terms can take different forms, yielding contributions to the scalar potential that scale differently with the overall volume. In the simplest single K\"ahler modulus case where $t_b = \sqrt{\tau_b} \simeq {V}^{1/3}$, the correction \eqref{v1} takes the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} =  \frac{\kappa_{F^4}\,V_0}{{V}^{11/3}} = \kappa_{F^4}\, V_0\,e^{-\frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\,,
\label{VF4}
\end{equation}
where we defined:
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{F^4} \equiv - \hat{\lambda}  \Pi_b \frac{|W_0|^4}{V_0}\,.
\end{equation}
The form of these corrections for the two moduli case can be derived by focusing on the $\mathbb{C} \rm{P}^4_{[1,1,1,6,9]}$ case where the volume can be written in terms of the 2-cycle volumes $t_1$ and $t_5$ as \cite{Denef:2004dm}:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac{1}{6} (3 t_1^2 t_5 + 18 t_1 t_5^2 + 26 t_5^3)\,,
\end{equation}
implying that the 4-cycles are given by:
\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_1} = t_5 (t_1 + 3 t_5) \quad\text{and}\quad \tau_5 = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_5} = \frac{1}{2} (t_1 + 6 t_5)^2\,.
\end{equation}
One can define $\tau_4$ as the linear combination:
\begin{equation}
\tau_4 = \tau_5 - 6 \tau_1 = \frac{t_1^2}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_1 = \sqrt{2 \tau_4}\,.
\end{equation}
Plugging $t_1$ back into the expression for $\tau_5$, solving the equation for $t_5$ and requiring that $t_5 > 0$ when $\tau_5 \gg \tau_4$ we get:
\begin{equation}
t_5 = \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2}} \left(\sqrt{\tau_5} - \sqrt{\tau_4}\right),
\end{equation}
from which it can be inferred that the volume has the form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac{1}{9 \sqrt{2}} \left(\tau_b^{3/2} - \tau_s^{3/2}\right),
\end{equation}
where we identified $\tau_5 \equiv \tau_b$ and $\tau_4 \equiv \tau_s$. Thus the $\alpha'$-correction of \eqref{v1} becomes:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} \simeq V_0 \left(\frac{\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}}}{{V}^{11/3}} + \frac{\kappa_{F^4_{(s)}} \sqrt{\tau_s}}{{V}^4}\right),
\label{deltav1}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}} = - \hat\lambda  \Pi_5 \frac{|W_0|^4}{6^{1/3} V_0} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \kappa_{F^4_{(s)}} = -\hat\lambda \sqrt{2} \left(\Pi_4 - \frac{\Pi_5}{6}\right) \frac{|W_0|^4}{V_0} \,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{String loop corrections}

The tree-level K\"ahler potential \eqref{leadingKP}, in addition to $\alpha'$ corrections, can also receive corrections due to string loops. 
These are encoded into two contributions to the K\"ahler potential, accounting for the exchange of Kaluza-Klein and winding modes \cite{loops}:
\begin{equation}
K^{KK}_{g_s} = g_s \sum_{i = 1}^{h_{1,1}} \frac{c_i (a_{ij} t^j)}{{V}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad K^W_{g_s} = \sum_{i = 1}^{h_{1,1}} \frac{d_i (a_{ij} t^j)^{-1}}{{V}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $c_i$ and $d_i$ are unknown constants while $a_{ij}$ are combinatorial factors. The final contribution to the scalar potential can be written as:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s} = \sum_{i = 1}^{h_{1,1}} \frac{|W_0|^2}{{V}^2} \left(g_s^2 c_i^2 \frac{\partial^2 K_{\rm tree}}{\partial \tau_i^2} - 2 K^W_{g_s}\right).
\label{slccontributiontov}
\end{equation}
Noting that $\partial^2 K_{\rm tree}/\partial\tau_b^2 = 3/(4 \tau_b^2)$, it turns out that in both scenarios the leading order string loop correction looks like:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s} = \frac{\kappa_{g_s}\,V_0}{{V}^{10/3}} = \kappa_{g_s}\,V_0\,e^{-\frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\,,
\label{Vgs}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_{g_s}$ is a real tunable number.

\subsubsection{Anti D3-branes}

Anti D3-branes yield a positive contribution to the scalar potential which in general provides a viable mechanism to realise a dS minimum. More precisely, the introduction of anti D3-branes in the compactification produces a term in the scalar potential of the form \cite{Kachru:2003aw}:
\begin{equation}
V_{\overline{D3}} = \frac{\kappa_{\overline{D3}}\,V_0}{{V}^2} = \kappa_{\overline{D3}}\,V_0\,e^{-\sqrt{6}\Phi}\,,
\label{VD3}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ is a positive real number which can be tuned to realise inflection point inflation with viable post-inflationary physics. 

\subsubsection{Charged hidden matter fields}

The possible presence on the big cycle of a hidden sector with matter fields $\phi$ charged under an anomalous $U(1)$ leads to the generation of moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms. The corresponding D-term potential reads:
\begin{equation}
V_D = \frac{1}{2 \text{Re}(f_b)} \left(q_{\phi} |\phi|^2 - \xi_b\right)^2\,,
\end{equation} 
where $f_b = T_b$ and $q_\phi$ is the $U(1)$-charge of $\phi$ while the FI-term is given by:
\begin{equation} 
\xi_b = - \frac{q_b}{4 \pi} \frac{\partial K_{\rm tree}}{\partial T_b} = \frac{3 q_b}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{equation} 
where $q_b$ the $U(1)$-charge of $T_b$. Since supersymmetry breaking effects generate a mass for $\phi$ of order the gravitino mass, the total scalar potential becomes:
\begin{equation}
V = V_D + c m_{3/2}^2 |\phi|^2 + {O}\left({V}^{-3}\right),
\end{equation}
where $c$ is an ${O}(1)$ coefficient which can be positive or negative depending on hidden sector model building details.
Integrating out $\phi$ leads to a new contribution which has been used to obtain dS vacua and takes the form \cite{ExplSeq}:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm hid} = \frac{\kappa_{\rm hid}\,V_0}{{V}^{8/3}} = \kappa_{\rm hid}\,V_0\,e^{-\frac{8}{\sqrt{6}}\Phi}\,,
\label{vds2}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_{\rm hid} = \frac{3 c q_b W_0^2}{16 \pi q_\phi V_0}$ is a tunable coefficient.\footnote{Note that $q_b$ and $q_\phi$ must have the same sign otherwise the minimum for $|\phi|$ would be at zero.}


\subsubsection{Total scalar potential}

The total scalar potential that we shall consider can in general be written as:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{\alpha'} + V_{\rm np} +  V_{F^4} + V_{g_s} + V_{\overline{D3}} + V_{\rm hid}\,,
\label{Vtot}
\end{equation}
where $V_{\alpha'}$ is the universal $\alpha'$ correction (\ref{Va}), $V_{\rm np}$ is the non-perturbative generated potential (\ref{Vnp}) which is non-negligible only in the two moduli case, $V_{F^4}$ are the higher derivative effects (\ref{VF4}) and (\ref{deltav1}), $V_{g_s}$ is the string loop potential (\ref{Vgs}), $V_{\overline{D3}}$ is the contribution (\ref{VD3}) from anti D3-branes and $V_{\rm hid}$ is the potential (\ref{vds2}) generated by the F-terms of charged hidden matter fields. 

Let us now add all these different contributions to the total scalar potential for the single modulus and the two moduli cases separately: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] \textit{Single modulus case}\\
In this simple model with only a single K\"ahler modulus, the generic expression for the scalar potential is:
\begin{equation}
V(\Phi) = V_0 \left(e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} + \kappa_{g_s} \,e^{- \frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{F^4} \,e^{- \frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} 
+ \kappa_{\overline{D3}} \,e^{- {\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{\rm hid} \,e^{- \frac{8}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\right).
\label{V1}
\end{equation}
In this setup the post-inflationary dS minimum is generated by the interplay between the universal $\alpha'^3$ term and the two terms proportional to $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ and $\kappa_{\rm hid}$, with the inflationary inflection point arising at smaller volumes in a region where the first three terms in \eqref{V1} are comparable in size. 

\item[b)] \textit{Two moduli case}\\
In the two moduli case, the total scalar potential (\ref{Vtot}) contains at least six terms. However, as we shall see in the next section, we need just five tunable parameters in order to get inflection point inflation. We shall therefore neglect the last term in (\ref{Vtot}) which might be removed by a model building choice. We stress that this choice does not affect our final results. In fact, if instead we neglected $V_{\overline{D3}}$ in (\ref{Vtot}), we would obtain qualitatively the same results. Thus in this case the total inflationary potential becomes:
\begin{equation}
V(\Phi) = V_0 \left[\left(1 - \kappa_{\rm np} \Phi^{3/2}\right) e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} + \kappa_{g_s} \,e^{-\frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} 
+ \kappa_{F^4_{(b)}} \,e^{-\frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{\overline{D3}}\, e^{- \sqrt{6} \Phi}\right].
\label{V2}
\end{equation}
Here we are including only the leading term of the higher derivatives corrections \eqref{deltav1} which is proportional to $\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}}$. Hence we are assuming that the term proportional to $\kappa_{F^4_{(s)}}$ is either very suppressed (a natural possibility given its volume scaling) or exactly vanishing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Single field dynamics}
\label{SecSingle}

In this section we study the effective single field inflationary dynamics for both the single modulus and the two moduli case. A deeper analysis of the effect of the heavy field for the two moduli case will be performed in Sec. \ref{SecTwo}. In order to obtain a phenomenologically viable model, we should require that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is an inflection point at $\Phi_{\rm ip}$.
\item The potential is such that the COBE normalisation is satisfied and the number of e-foldings is $N_e \simeq 60$.
\item There is de Sitter minimum at large volumes at $\Phi_{\rm min}$.
\end{enumerate}
As we will see below, these requirements translate into five conditions on the scalar potential, and so we need five tunable free parameters.


\subsection{Analytical discussion}

As a first step, let us discuss the strategy used to determine the free parameters in \eqref{V1} and \eqref{V2} in order to get inflection point inflation. The position of the inflection point $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and the minimum $\Phi_{\rm min}$ can be chosen independently with the only constraint (apart from $\Phi_{\rm min}>\Phi_{\rm ip}$) being:
\begin{equation}
\vo_{\rm ip} = e^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \Phi_{\rm ip}} \gtrsim 10^3\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad\Phi_{\rm ip} \gtrsim 5\,,
\end{equation}
in order to trust the effective field theory during inflation.

Once $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and $\Phi_{\rm min}$ are chosen, we impose that the scalar potential actually produces an inflection point and the late time minimum at the desired positions. This can be done by scanning over flux parameters, intersections numbers and gauge groups so that the following constraints are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Inflection point}
\begin{eqnarray}
&& (1) \quad \left.V''\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} = 0 \label{eq:cond1}\\
&& (2) \quad \left. V' \cdot V'''\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} = \left.\frac{2 \pi^2 V^2}{(170)^2}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}}\label{eq:cond2}
\end{eqnarray}
\item \textit{Late time minimum}
\begin{eqnarray} 
&& (3) \quad \left.V'\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm min}} = 0 \label{eq:cond3}\\
&& (4) \quad \left.V\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm min}} = 0 \label{eq:cond4}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}
The first two conditions produce an inflection point at $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ with the right slope to yield a scalar spectral tilt around $n_s = 0.96$, while the last two conditions imply the existence of a Minkowski minimum at $\Phi_{\rm min}$. These conditions are invariant under a rescaling of $V_0$ in \eqref{V1} and \eqref{V2} since it is just an overall multiplicative factor in the scalar potential. $V_0$ is instead fixed by the requirement of obtaining the right COBE normalisation given by \eqref{cobe} which can also be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
(5) \quad \Delta^2 = \left.\frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_*} \simeq \left.\frac{1}{12 \pi^2} \frac{V^3}{\left(V'\right)^2}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} \simeq 2.4 \cdot 10^{-9}\,.
\end{equation}
Given the definition of $V_0$ in \eqref{eq:V0}, condition (5) can be seen as a constraint on the magnitude of the flux superpotential $W_0$ which in type IIB string compactifications naturally lies in the range $[0.1,\,100]$. We will show now how additional constraints on $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ arise from combining this naturalness criterion with the requirement of low-energy supersymmetry. In fact we shall carefully choose $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ so that the COBE normalisation fixes $W_0$ in the natural range mentioned above. Fixing $W_0$ through the condition (5) sets also the energy scale of the soft terms. Here we distinguish between two possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Non-sequestered models}: If the cycle supporting the visible sector is stabilised in geometric regime, the soft terms are of order the gravitino mass:
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm soft} \simeq m_{3/2} \simeq \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{8 \pi} }\frac{W_0}{\vo_{\rm min}}\,.
\label{eq:unseq}
\end{equation}
This is usually referred to as the non-sequestered case which for $W_0\sim 1$ leads to TeV-scale supersymmetry only for values of the volume as large as ${V}\sim 10^{14}$. This is possible for the two moduli case where the value of the visible sector coupling does not depend on ${V}$. In the single modulus case, since $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}={V}^{2/3}$, the volume has to be of order $100$, resulting necessarily in a high-scale SUSY scenario.

\item \textit{Sequestered models}: If the visible sector modulus is fixed in the singular regime, the soft terms can be very suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass: 
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm soft} \simeq \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}} \simeq \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}} \frac{W_0}{\vo_{\rm min}^2}\,.
\label{eq:seq}
\end{equation}
This is usually referred to as the sequestered scenario which for $W_0\sim 1$ leads to low-energy supersymmetry only for ${V}\sim 10^7$. In these sequestered models supersymmetry is broken in the bulk of the extra-dimensions while the visible sector lives on branes localised at a singularity. Given that in this case the visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, this scenario can be realised both in the single and in the two moduli case.
\end{itemize}
The magnitude of the flux superpotential that satisfies condition (5) for a generic inflection point $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ can be estimated by noting that at horizon exit $\epsilon\sim 10^{-10}$ and there is a percent level cancellation between the three dominant terms. This implies that at the inflection point $V\sim 0.01\ V_0 \ e^{-\sqrt{27/2}\Phi_{\rm ip}}$, and so the Hubble scale can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
\label{hubbleestimate}
H = \sqrt{\frac{V_{\rm ip}}{3 M_P^2}} \simeq \frac{1}{10 \sqrt{3}} \frac{\sqrt{V_0 M_P^2}}{\vo_{\rm ip}^{3/2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\xi}{2 \pi g_s^{1/2}}} \frac{W_0 M_P}{40 \vo_{\rm ip}^{3/2}}\,,
\end{equation}
where we used \eqref{eq:V0} and we restored the correct dependence on the Planck mass $M_P$. Using the same argument we can also estimate the amplitude of the scalar perturbations in \eqref{cobe} as:
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_*}\simeq \frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{0.01\ V_0 \ e^{-\sqrt{27/2}\Phi_{\rm ip}}}{10^{-10}}
\simeq 2.4 \times 10^{-9}\,,
\end{equation}
which yields:
\begin{equation}
W_0^2\simeq 7.58 \times 10^{-15}\ 8 \pi \sqrt{g_s} \, \, e^{\sqrt{27/2}\ \Phi_{\rm ip}}\,.
\label{eq:w0}
\end{equation}
Assuming $g_s\simeq 0.1$, we conclude that only inflection points in the range $\Phi_{\rm ip} \in [6,\,10]$ are compatible with natural values of $W_0$.

We can take these simple estimates further and for each $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ obeying \eqref{eq:w0} find the position of the late time minimum $\Phi_{\rm min}$ that gives rise to TeV-scale soft masses in both sequestered and non-sequestered scenarios. For the sequestered case we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\ W_0^2 \ e^{-2 \sqrt{6}\ \Phi_{\rm min}}\simeq 10^{-30}\,,
\end{equation}
which by using \eqref{eq:w0} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm min}\simeq 6.76 +\frac{3}{4}\Phi_{\rm ip}\,.
\label{eq:est_seq}
\end{equation}
A similar estimate for the non-sequestered case yields:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm min}\simeq 13.51 +\frac{3}{2}\Phi_{\rm ip}\,.
\label{eq:est_unseq}
\end{equation}
Hence we see that the distance between the inflection point and the minimum in the non-sequestered case is exactly twice the corresponding distance in the sequestered setup. The factor of two descends directly from the extra volume suppression of \eqref{eq:seq} when compared with \eqref{eq:unseq}. In both cases the combination of the observational constraint on the amplitude of the density perturbations, the theoretical bias on natural values of $W_0$ and the requirement of TeV-scale soft terms conspire to fix the distance between the inflationary inflection point and the late-time minimum.

Tables \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2} illustrate some reference values obtained using \eqref{eq:w0} to fix the inflection point for different values of $W_0$, and then \eqref{eq:est_unseq} and \eqref{eq:est_seq} to get the late-time minimum in the non-sequestered (Tab. \ref{tab1}) and sequestered (Tab. \ref{tab2}) scenarios respectively.

\label{tab2}
\end{table}

Using the values listed in Tab. \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2} to estimate the Hubble scale as in \eqref{hubbleestimate} we get $H \simeq 10^{10}$ GeV which corresponds to an inflationary scale of order $10^{14}$ GeV. This result can also be obtained numerically using the more precise values listed in the next section.

Let us comment on the consistency of our effective field theory approach. As derived in \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}, the superspace derivative
expansion is under control if $m_{3/2}\ll M_{\rm KK}$ which translates into the bound:
\begin{equation}
\delta \equiv \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{2}} \frac{W_0}{{V}^{1/3} } \ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
This bound is satisfied in each case of Tab. \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2} both around the inflection point and the late-time minimum. In fact, considering just the region around the inflection point (${V}$ becomes larger around the minimum and so this bound is stronger during inflation) and setting $g_s=0.1$, we have: $\delta\simeq 10^{-3}$ for $W_0=0.1$, $\delta\simeq 10^{-2}$ for $W_0=1$, $\delta\simeq5\cdot 10^{-2}$ for $W_0=10$ and $\delta\simeq 0.1$ for $W_0=100$.
Thus the superspace derivative expansion is under control, and so higher derivative $\alpha'$ corrections should naturally be suppressed. Therefore, as we shall show in the next section, we have to tune the coefficient of the $F^4$ $\alpha'$ terms (\ref{VF4}) and (\ref{deltav1}) to large values. However the fact that the expansion parameter $\delta$ turns out to be small, allows us to neglect further higher derivative corrections in a consistent way. 


\subsection{Numerical results}

In this section we present a detailed numerical study of inflection point volume inflation. We start by focusing on the non-sequestered single modulus case with high-scale SUSY. In this case the late-time minimum is bound to be of order $100$, so that the evolution of the canonically normalised field $\Phi$ is very limited. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. \ref{smallvol}, it is possible to get an inflection point and a late-time minimum at the desired values. The scalar potential is plotted in Fig. \ref{smallvol}. We require $\Phi_{\rm ip} = 3.5$ and $\Phi_{\rm min} = 4.2$, corresponding respectively to values of the volume $\vo_{\rm ip} \simeq 72$ and $\vo_{\rm min} \simeq 171$. These values are clearly too small to trust the effective field theory approach. However we shall still present the numerical results for this case for illustrative purposes, and shall focus later on cases with low-energy supersymmetry where the volume during and after inflation is larger and the supergravity effective theory is under much better control.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{smallvol}
\end{figure}

In this example it is possible to reproduce the correct value of the spectral index, as a consequence of the condition \eqref{eq:cond2}. We list in Tab. \ref{tab0} the numerical results obtained for different positions of the inflection point and the late-time minimum for which we get always $n_s \simeq 0.96$.
\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Numerical results for the coefficients of the scalar potential for the single modulus case with the visible sector on D7-branes wrapping the volume cycle.}
\label{tab0}
\end{table}

$\Delta \Phi$ is the field excursion of the canonically normalised volume modulus $\Phi$ between horizon exit and the end of inflation. Since $\Delta \Phi\sim 0.1 M_P$ we are clearly dealing with a small field inflationary model. Thus the tensor-to-scalar ratio is of order $r \simeq 10^{-10}$. The values of $W_0$ reported in Tab. \ref{tab0} are the numerical results which satisfy the COBE normalisation. The corresponding Hubble scale in each case is $H \simeq 10^9$ GeV which translates into an inflationary scale around $10^{14}$ GeV. 

We now turn to study the two more interesting sequestered and non-sequestered cases with larger values of the volume and TeV-scale supersymmetry. 
Since in both cases the shape of the scalar potential is always qualitatively the same around the inflection point and the late-time minimum, we plot it in Fig. \ref{SingleFieldNonSequestered1} just for the non-sequestered case.

The numerical results listed below are obtained by requiring that the inflection point and the late-time minimum are those given in Tab. \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2} where we required natural values of $W_0$ and low-energy supersymmetry in both non-sequestered and sequestered cases. The tensor-to-scalar ratio turns out to be always of order $r \simeq 10^{-9}$. In the following tables the only inputs are $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and $\Phi_{\rm min}$, while $W_0$, $\kappa_{g_s}$, $\kappa_{F^4}$ (or $\kappa_{F^4_{\rm (b)}}$), $\kappa_{\rm hid}$, $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ and $\kappa_{\rm np}$ are the numerical outputs obtained by solving \eqref{eq:cond1} and \eqref{eq:cond4}. As a consequence of the condition \eqref{eq:cond2}, the value of the spectral index is $n_s \simeq 0.967$ in each of the cases listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Single modulus case}: 

Let us start with the simplest single modulus case of \eqref{V1}. The numerical results relative to the non-sequestered case with low-energy SUSY are listed in Tab. \ref{tab3} while those relative to the sequestered case are listed in Tab. \ref{tab4}:

Two important observations can be inferred from the values of the coefficients listed in Tab. \ref{tab3}, \ref{tab4}, \ref{tab5} and \ref{tab6}. The first one is that $\kappa_{g_s}$ and $\kappa_{\rm hid}$ are always required to be negative. In our models the negative sign of $\kappa_{g_s}$ can be obtained by the interplay of the two terms in \eqref{slccontributiontov} while the sign of $\kappa_{\rm hid}$ depends on hidden sector model building details. Moreover the presence of the inflection point is highly sensitive to small variations of the coefficients in Tab. \ref{tab3}, \ref{tab4}, \ref{tab5} and \ref{tab6}. Thus in order to accurately reproduce the shape of the scalar potential in each case, it is necessary to tune the coefficients to a much higher level of precision than that reported in the Tables.
\end{itemize}

\section{Two field dynamics}
\label{SecTwo}

Up to this point we have dealt exclusively with the single field limit, implicitly assuming that all other moduli, like the axio-dilaton, the complex structure moduli and additional K\"ahler moduli, are heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation. While this may be arranged for in the single K\"ahler modulus case, it is certainly not true for the model constructed within the LVS framework. In this section we comment on various aspects of the two field dynamics of this model.

As shown in Sec. \ref{SecOrigin}, the effective single field potential of \eqref{V2} is obtained after integrating out the small blow-up modulus $\tau_s$. This procedure is valid in the vicinity of the LVS minimum where there is a clear mass hierarchy:
\begin{equation}
m_{\tau_s}^2 \sim \frac{g_s}{8\pi}\frac{W_0^2}{\vo_{\rm min}^2} \gg \frac{g_s}{8\pi}\frac{W_0^2}{\vo_{\rm min}^3} \sim m_{\tau_b}^2\,,
\end{equation}
however it fails around the inflection point where both fields are very light $m_{\tau_s}^2, m_{\tau_b}^2 \ll H^2 $, implying that both will be dynamical during inflation. This is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:2FieldLVS_pot}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\subfloat[][\emph{Inflationary region}.]
{\includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{2Field_inflectionPoint.jpg}} \quad
\subfloat[][\emph{Large volume region}.]
{\includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{2Field_min.jpg}} 
\caption{Scalar potential \eqref{V2} in the inflationary region, around the tuned point $(\tau_b,\tau_s)|_{\rm ip}=(1000,20)$ and in the large volume region $(\tau_b,\tau_s)|_{\rm min}=(2.4\times 10^9, 16.4)$.}
\label{fig:2FieldLVS_pot}
\end{figure}

Due to the flatness of the scalar potential along both directions, the correct way to analyse the system is by numerically solving the background field equations as done in the original work \cite{Conlon:2008cj}. Here we will extend the aforementioned analysis by studying the sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions in a given potential and by clarifying to what extent the single field results constitute a valid approximation to the inflationary observables. The reader looking for more details of the setup is referred to \cite{Conlon:2008cj} as we will focus only on the results obtained.

We proceed in the same spirit of the single field analysis by choosing the coefficients that induce an inflection point along the volume direction. For concreteness we choose $(\tau_b,\tau_s)|_{\rm ip}=(1000,20)$. We then consider a set of initial conditions around that point and numerically solve the equations of motion. In Fig. \ref{fig:2FieldLVS} we plot the solutions for the different choices of initial positions for the system. We assume throughout that the fields are released with vanishing velocities and find that the sensitivity to the initial position, that is characteristic of inflection point models, is magnified in the two field setup as perturbing the initial conditions by a small amount can lead to drastically different outcomes. Starting uphill from the inflection point tends to lead to trajectories that produce insufficient expansion. In some cases, depending on the ratio $\tau_s^{\rm ip}/\tau_s^{\rm min}$, some of these trajectories can lead to the collapse of the compact manifold to vanishing volume. For trajectories that start downhill from the tuned point, it is easier to obtain a viable post inflationary evolution, with the system evolving towards the LVS minimum, but the number of e-foldings decreases drastically with the distance from the tuned point. One is therefore led to the conclusion that viable inflationary trajectories are obtained only in a narrow region around $\tau_b^{\rm ip}$ and $\tau_s\gtrsim \tau_s^{\rm ip}$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
{\includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{2Field_traj.pdf}} \quad

\caption{Trajectories around the flat inflection point at $(\tau_b,\tau_s)= (1000 , 20)$ marked by the star. Blue (thicker) trajectories correspond to those evolving towards the post-inflationary large volume minimum, while the magenta (thinner) end with a collapsing volume modulus. Right: Magnification around the initial points. The numbers denote the total number of slow-roll e-foldings for each trajectory.}
\label{fig:2FieldLVS}
\end{figure}

In what concerns inflationary observables in the two field setup one expects the projection along the inflationary trajectory (and hence the single field estimates of Sec. \ref{SecSingle}) to be a good approximation to the full result. This follows directly from the fact that the observable portion of the trajectories yielding $N_e\ge 60$, is rather straight, as can be seen by the smallness of the inverse curvature radius plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:2FieldLVS}. This implies that curvature and isocurvature perturbations are essentially decoupled and that a straightforward generalisation of the single field case leads to an accurate estimate of the cosmological observables.\footnote{For thorough discussion of this issue in the context of a local string inflation model see \cite{Bielleman:2015lka}.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{SecConcl}

It has long been acknowledged that there is severe tension between having simultaneously low-scale supersymmetry and high scale inflation in supergravity models. This is due to the fact that the inflationary energy density contributes to the moduli potential and will in generally tend to destabilise them.

Several mechanisms to decrease or eliminate this tension have been proposed over the years and in this work we further develop the proposal of \cite{Conlon:2008cj}. This particular model solves the tension between TeV-scale supersymmetry and the inflationary scale by having an evolving compactification volume between the inflationary epoch and today. Inflation is due to an inflection point in the volume direction of the scalar potential which also possesses a minimum at large volume where the modulus is supposed to sit at late-time after inflation. In order to prevent overshooting it is necessary to require that a small amount of radiation is generated after the end of inflation. The presence of this additional radiation is well justified in the two field model since it could be produced by the oscillations of the heavy modulus around its minimum while in the single field model particle production could be induced by a changing vacuum state between the end of inflation and today. 

In this paper we described a possible microscopic origin of the inflationary scalar potential that allows the gravitino mass to vary after the end of inflation and at the same time features a late-time dS minimum. In particular, we provided an explicit construction where the inflationary inflection point is generated by the interplay between string loops and higher derivative $\alpha'$ corrections to the scalar potential. Moreover, we supplemented the LVS construction with a new model that involves only one K\"ahler modulus. While in the LVS two moduli model non-perturbative effects play a crucial r\^ole in determining the presence of both the inflection point and the late-time minimum, in the single modulus model non-perturbative effects are absent and an additional contribution arising from the F-terms of charged hidden matter is needed. For both models we analysed the relation between the value of the volume during inflation and at present with the size of the flux superpotential $W_0$. We found that the distance between the inflection point and the late-time minimum is fixed by the choice of $W_0$. Requiring a late-time minimum which leads to TeV-scale supersymmetry, natural values of the flux superpotential $W_0\sim {O}(1)$ give rise to inflection point inflation around values of the volume of order ${V}\sim{O}(10^5)$ which is large enough to trust the effective field theory approach. 

We finally studied the full dynamics of the two field system in the LVS model and showed that, after tuning the potential such that it features the desired inflection point, there is a significant sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions. Perturbing the starting positions of the fields even by a small amount can lead to a radically different cosmological evolution. We also showed that, despite the presence of two dynamical fields, the predictions for the cosmological observables derived in the single field case are accurate since the field space trajectories are essentially straight over the last $60$ e-foldings of expansion.

In this section\footnote{To ease the notation, in Secs.~\ref{sec:non-minimal} and~\ref{sec:attractors} we will work in Planck units, $m_p = 1$, while reintroducing $m_p$ in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs}.} we generalize the analysis presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:review} to the case where the inflaton is non-minimally coupled to gravity. In general non-minimal couplings between the inflaton and gravity may naturally arise in the context of supergravity and string theory~\cite{Kallosh:2000ve} or from radiative corrections in the framework of QFT in curved space-time.\footnote{For an introduction to the topic see for example~\cite{Birrel:1984}.} Moreover, during the last years it was realized that the introduction of a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity (in the Jordan frame) can provide a mechanism to ``flatten'' the inflationary potential (in the Einstein frame)~\cite{Bezrukov:2007ep,Bezrukov:2009db,Kallosh:2013tua,Einhorn:2009bh,Ferrara:2010yw,Buchmuller:2013zfa,Giudice:2014toa,Pallis:2013yda,Pallis:2014dma,Pallis:2014boa,Ellis:2013xoa,Kallosh:2013xya,
Nakayama:2010ga} leading to predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the  tensor-to-scalar-ratio $r$  that lie right in the sweet spot of the constraints set by CMB observations~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}. For these reasons it is interesting to consider a generalization of the mechanism discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:review} in order to take these models into account.

 
We start by considering the action for a pseudoscalar field $\phi$ non-minimally coupled to gravity and coupled to an Abelian gauge field\footnote{The generalization to $\mathcal{N}$ Abelian gauge fields $A^a_{\mu}$ is straight-forward. To ease the notation, we will work with ${\cal N} = 1$ here and re-introduce the parameter ${\cal N}$ only in the final expressions.} through the topological Chern-Simons term,
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:jordan_frame}
	\mathcal{S} = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g_J} \left[ \frac{\, \Omega(\phi ) \, R}{2} -X -V_J -\frac{g_J^{\mu\rho}g_J^{\nu\sigma}}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -\frac{\alpha}{8 \Lambda} \frac{\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}}{ \sqrt{-g_J}} \, \phi \, F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} \right] \ ,
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol, $X \equiv g_J^{\mu \nu} \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial_{\nu} \phi /2$, $F_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$, $\alpha$ is the coupling between the pseudoscalar and the gauge field, $\Lambda $ is a mass scale that suppresses the higher dimensional operator $\phi F \tilde{F}$ and $\Omega(\phi)$ is function of $\phi$ that without loss of generality can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \varsigma f(\phi) \ , 
\end{equation}
where $\varsigma$ is a the dimensionless coupling constant and $f(\phi)$ is a generic function of $\phi$. The case discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:review} can be easily recovered by setting $\varsigma = 0$.

The action of Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:jordan_frame} corresponds to a Jordan frame formulation of the theory (explaining the subscript J). The Einstein frame formulation (where gravity is described by a standard Einstein-Hilbert term) of the theory is found via a conformal transformation:
\begin{equation}
	g_{J\, \mu\nu} \rightarrow g_{\mu\nu} = \Omega(\phi) g_{J\, \mu\nu} \, ,
\end{equation}
so that the action reads:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:einstein_frame}
	\mathcal{S} = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{2} - K(\phi)X -V_E -\frac{g^{\mu\rho}g^{\nu\sigma}}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -\frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \frac{\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}}{2 \sqrt{-g}} \, \phi \, F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} \right] \ ,
\end{equation}
where $V_E \equiv V_J/\Omega^2(\phi)$ and $K(\phi)$ is defined as:\footnote{In order to make expressions simpler sometimes we will write $K$ instead of $K(\phi)$.}
\begin{equation}
 	K(\phi) \equiv \Omega^{-1} +  \frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{\textrm{d} \ln \Omega }{\textrm{d} \phi} \right)^2 \, .
 \end{equation} 
Note that the action shown in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:einstein_frame} is the action for a pseudoscalar field that is minimally coupled to gravity but that has a non-standard kinetic term.\footnote{Pseudoscalar theories from string theory compactifications typically exhibit a canonically coupling to gravity, a coupling of the pseudoscalar to the topological term of a gauge theory as well as a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudoscalar. It is hence in the formulation in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:einstein_frame} that our model may arise from string theory. For more details see appendix \ref{app:axions}.} As a consequence the treatment carried out in the rest of this section is valid for both these cases.


In the following we discuss the evolution of the system defined by the action of Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:einstein_frame}. In particular we study both the evolution of the homogeneous background and of perturbations around this background. As a first step we start by computing the equation of motion for the gauge field. For this purpose we take the variation of the action (expressed in terms of conformal coordinates) with respect to $A_{\nu}$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta A_{\nu}}  = \partial_{\mu} \left[ \frac{\eta^{\mu\rho}\eta^{\nu\sigma}}{2}\left( \partial_{\rho} A_{\sigma} - \partial_{\sigma} A_{\rho} \right) \right] + \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \partial_{\mu} \left[ \phi \, \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \left( \partial_{\rho} A_{\sigma} - \partial_{\sigma} A_{\rho} \right) \right] = 0 \ ,
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. At this point we can proceed by fixing the gauge. A convenient gauge to describe the problem is Coulomb gauge, i.e.\ $g^{\mu \nu }\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu} = 0 , A_0 = 0$ so that the equation of motion reads:
\begin{equation}
\eta^{\nu\sigma} \Box A_{\sigma} - \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \phi^{\prime} \varepsilon^{0\nu\rho\sigma} \partial_{\rho} A_{\sigma} = 0 \ , 
\end{equation}
where $\Box$ is the standard flat space d'Alembert operator $\Box \equiv \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu}$. As a consequence we can write:
\begin{equation}
\label{non_minimal:gauge_fields}
\Box \vec{A}  - \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \phi^{\prime} \, \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} = 0 \ , 
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\nabla} \times $ is the usual curl operator and a prime is used to denote a derivative with respect to $\tau$. This equation matches with the Eq.~\eqref{review:eq_motionA} and thus the solution for the gauge fields is exactly the same as in the case of a minimal coupling to gravity.

We can now consider the variation of the action (again in conformal time) with respect to $\phi$ to get the equation of motion for the inflaton:
\begin{equation}
	\partial_\mu \left( \eta^{\mu \nu} K(\phi) a^2 \, \partial_\nu \phi \right) -a^4 \left( \frac{\partial V_E}{\partial \phi}(\phi) + \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}\right) = 0 \ ,
\end{equation}
which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:eom_phi_general}
	- K(\phi) \Box\phi -\frac{K_{,\phi}(\phi)}{2} \eta^{\mu\nu} \, \partial_\mu \, \phi \partial_\nu \phi+ 2a \mathcal{H} K(\phi)\phi^\prime + a^2 \, V_{E,\phi}(\phi) + a^2 \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle = 0  \, ,
\end{equation}
where ${}_{,\phi} $ is used to denote a derivative with respect to $\phi$, primes are used to denote a derivatives with respect to $\tau$ and $\mathcal{H}\equiv a^\prime/a$. At this point we can express $\phi$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\phi(\tau,\vec{x}) = \phi_0(\tau) + \delta \phi(\tau,\vec{x}) \ , 
\end{equation}
where $\phi_0(\tau)$ is the (homogeneous) background solution and $\delta \phi(\tau,\vec{x})$ is a small perturbation. By substituting this parametrization into Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:eom_phi_general} it is easy to show that the equation of motion for the background field $\phi_0$ reads:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:background_conformal}
	K(\phi_0) \phi_0^{\prime \prime} + \frac{K_{,\phi}(\phi_0)}{2} \phi_0^{\prime\, 2} + 2a \mathcal{H} K(\phi_0)\phi_0^\prime + a^2 \, V_{E,\phi}(\phi_0) + a^2 \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle = 0  \, .
\end{equation}
Conversely, the linearized equation of motion for the perturbation reads:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\label{non_minimal:perturbations}
	&\delta\phi^{\prime \prime} - \vec{\nabla}^2\delta\phi +\frac{1}{2}\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi} \left(\frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi}\right) \phi_0^{\prime\, 2} \delta\phi + \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi} \phi_0^{\prime} \delta\phi^\prime + 2a \mathcal{H} \delta \phi^\prime +  \\ 
	&+ a^2 \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi} \left( \frac{V_{E,\phi}}{K}\right)\delta \phi  - \frac{a^2}{K^2} K_{,\phi} \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle \delta \phi + \frac{a^2}{K} \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \delta\left( \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle\right) = 0 \ .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
A detailed analysis on the evolution of the background and of the inflaton perturbation is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:background} and in Sec.~\ref{sec:perturbations} respectively. 

\subsection{Background evolution}
\label{sec:background}
As a first step we express Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:background_conformal} in terms of cosmic time ($\textrm{d}t = a \, \textrm{d}\tau$) and we divide by $K(\phi_0)$ to get:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:background_cosmic}
	\ddot{\phi}_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \dot{\phi}_0^2 + 3 H \dot{\phi}_0 + \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K} + \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda K} \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
We can also express Friedmann equation as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:background_friedmann}
	3 H^2 = K \frac{\dot{\phi}_0^2}{2} + V_E + \frac{1}{2} \langle \vec{E}^2 + \vec{B}^2 \rangle \ .
\end{equation}
At this point we can solve Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:gauge_fields} and plug the solution into Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:background_cosmic} and Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:background_friedmann} to get:\footnote{Notice that these expressions for $\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle$ and $\langle \vec{E}^2 + \vec{B}^2 \rangle$ only hold for sizable values for $\xi$ (i.e.\ for $\xi \gtrsim 1$). Different expressions should be used for small values of $\xi$, see~\cite{Anber:2009ua}.}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{non_minimal:background_scalar}
	\ddot{\phi}_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \dot{\phi}_0^2 + 3 H \dot{\phi}_0 + \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K} - 2.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \, \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda K} \frac{H^4}{\xi^4} e^{2 \pi \xi} = 0 \ , \\
	\label{non_minimal:background_friedmann_2}
	3 H^2 = K \frac{\dot{\phi}_0^2}{2} + V_E + 1.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^3} e^{2 \pi \xi}	 \ ,
\end{eqnarray}
with the parameter $\xi$ defined as in Eq.~\eqref{review:xi},
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:xi_def}
	\xi \equiv \frac{\alpha}{2 \Lambda} \, \frac{|\dot{\phi}_0|}{H} \ .
\end{equation}
Note that here $\phi_0$ is not the canonically normalized field. If the field $\phi_0$ is slow-rolling these equations can be approximated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{non_minimal:slow_roll_gauge}
	 3 H \dot{\phi}_0 + \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K} - 2.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \, \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda K} \frac{H^4}{\xi^4} e^{2 \pi \xi} \simeq 0 \ , \\
	 	\label{non_minimal:slow_roll_friedmann}
	3 H^2 \simeq V_E + 1.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^3} e^{2 \pi \xi} \ ,
\end{eqnarray}
so that in the first part of the evolution (where $\xi \simeq 1$) we recover the usual slow-roll equations:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:slow_roll}
	\dot{\phi}_0 \simeq - \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{3 H K} \ , \qquad \qquad 3 H^2 \simeq V_E \ .
\end{equation}
As in Sec.~\ref{sec:review}, the back-reaction of the gauge fields on the Friedmann equation (i.e.\ Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:slow_roll_friedmann}) is negligible throughout the whole evolution, but it may have a significant impact on Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:slow_roll_gauge}. As above, the $\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B} \rangle$ term plays the role of a friction term which grows exponentially with $\xi$. Notice that as long as the gauge field contribution is not too strong we find for the first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$,\footnote{As long as the back-reaction of the gauge fields is negligible, this definition is equivalent to the more commonly used `potential' slow-roll parameter, $\epsilon_H \simeq \epsilon_V = m_p^2 (V'(\phi)/V)^2/(2 K)$.}
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:epsilon_H}
	\epsilon_H \equiv -\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} \simeq \frac{1}{2} K(\phi_0) \left( \frac{\dot{\phi}_0}{H} \right)^2 \propto K(\phi_0) \xi^2 \ ,
\end{equation}
where we have used Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:slow_roll} and Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:xi_def}. As for a vast majority of slow-roll inflationary models $\epsilon_H$ grows during inflation,\footnote{In particular this happens for 
all the models considered in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:potentials_and_xi}).} for sufficiently large values of $\alpha/\Lambda$ we expect a strong gauge field production that strongly affects the dynamics towards the end of inflation. However, it is crucial to stress that in general $\xi$ is not \emph{monotonically} increasing for all the slow-roll inflationary models. For example, if both  $\epsilon_H$ and $K(\phi_0)$ monotonically increase during inflation, their interplay may lead to a local maximum in $\xi$, if the growth in $K(\phi_0)$ dominates the growth of $\epsilon_H$ at late times. Such a scenario will be particularly relevant for the discussion of PBHs in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs}. 

\subsection{Perturbations}
\label{sec:perturbations}
In order to study the evolution of the inflaton perturbations we start by expressing the $\delta\left( \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle\right)$ term appearing in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:perturbations} in a convenient form. In particular following the treatment of~\cite{Anber:2009ua} we proceed by using:
\begin{equation}
\label{non_minimal:gauge_field_contrib}
\delta\left( \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle\right) = [\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} - \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle]_{\delta \phi = 0} + \frac{\partial \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle}{\partial \dot{\phi}_0}\frac{ \delta \phi^{\prime} }{a} \equiv \delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}} \, -  \left( \frac{ \pi \alpha}{ \Lambda H } \right)  \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle \, \frac{\delta \phi^\prime}{a} \ .
\end{equation}
We can thus proceed by substituting this expression into Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:perturbations} (expressed in terms of cosmic time) to get:
\begin{equation}
\label{non_minimal:scalar_fluctuations}
\begin{aligned}
	&\ddot{\delta\phi} - \frac{\vec{\nabla}^2}{a^2}\delta\phi +\frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left(\frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}\right) \dot{\phi}_0^{ 2} \delta\phi + \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \dot{\phi}_0 \dot{\delta\phi} + 3H \dot{\delta \phi} + \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left( \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K}\right)\delta \phi \\ 
	& - \frac{1}{K} \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}  \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle \delta \phi + \frac{1}{K} \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \left[ \delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}} \, -  \left( \frac{ \pi \alpha}{ \Lambda H } \right)  \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle \dot{\delta \phi} \right] = 0 \ .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Let us start by discussing the regime where the gauge field contribution is negligible before we proceed by considering the strong gauge field regime. If the gauge field contribution is negligible the scalar power spectrum $\Delta^2_s(k)$ is simply given by the standard vacuum amplitude:
\begin{equation}
	\left.   \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{vac} \simeq   \frac{ 1 }{8 \, \pi^2 } \frac{H^2}{  c_s \ \epsilon_H }\ , 
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_H$ is the first (Hubble) slow-roll parameter defined in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:epsilon_H} and $c_s$ is the speed of sound that for all the models considered in this work is equal to one. Using Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:slow_roll} it is easy to show that the vacuum amplitude can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:vacuum}
	\left.   \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{vac} \simeq   \frac{ K V }{12 \, \pi^2 }  \left( \frac{\textrm{d} \ln V_E}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}\right)^{-2} \ .
\end{equation}
Conversely, in the strong gauge field regime the gauge-field induced contributions (i.e.\ the terms proportional to $\langle \vec{E}\cdot\vec{B} \rangle $) are large. At this point we can neglect all the higher order terms in the slow-roll parameters as well as all the terms that are not exponentially enhanced\footnote{For more details on the derivation of this formula and for consistency checks see appendix~\ref{sec:spectrum}.} and the scalar power spectrum in the strong gauge field regime can be expressed as:
 \begin{equation}
 	\label{non_minimal:gauge_sourced}
 	\left.  \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{gauge} \simeq  \left(\frac{\alpha \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a  \rangle / \sqrt{\mathcal{N}} }{3 \, b \, \Lambda \, \dot{\phi}_0 \, H \, K }\right)^2  \ ,
 \end{equation}
  where we have defined:
\begin{equation}
	b \equiv  1  -  \pi \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \frac{\langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a  \rangle}{3 \, H^2 K} \ ,
	\label{eq:b}
\end{equation}
and we have generalized the result to the case where $\mathcal{N}$ Abelian gauge fields are coupled to the inflaton. Finally we can use both Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:vacuum} and Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:gauge_sourced} to get the complete expression for the scalar power spectrum:
 \begin{equation}
 	\label{non_minimal:scalar_final}
 	\Delta^2_s (k) \simeq  \frac{ 1 }{K}  \left( \frac{H^2 }{2 \pi |\dot{\phi}_0|}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\alpha \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a  \rangle / \sqrt{\mathcal{N}} }{3 \, b \, \Lambda \, \dot{\phi}_0 \, H \, K }\right)^2 \ .
 \end{equation}
In the regime where the gauge fields dominate the evolution we can approximate $b$ by simply neglecting the constant term (i.e.\ the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:b}). One can then easily show that:
\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx}
 	\left.  \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_{\text{gauge}} \simeq  \frac{  1 }{ 4 \pi^2 \xi^2 \mathcal{N} }  \ ,
 \end{equation}
which corresponds (at least in form) to the expression given in Eq.~\eqref{review:scalar_strong}. There are some conceptual (and indeed physical) differences that must be pointed out:
\begin{itemize}
	\item While Eq.~\eqref{review:scalar_strong} is expressed in terms of a canonically normalized field, Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx} is expressed in terms of the non-canonically normalized field. As a consequence, in order to match the two equations we should express the dynamics in terms of a canonically normalized field $\varphi$ defined as $(\textrm{d} \varphi / \textrm{d} \phi_0)^2 \equiv K(\phi_0)$. Using this definition Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx} can be turned into:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx_varphi}
 	\left.  \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{gauge} \simeq  \frac{  K(\phi_0) }{ 4 \pi^2 \mathcal{N}   \tilde{\xi}^2 }  \propto \frac{K}{\epsilon_H} ,
 \end{equation}
	where $\tilde{\xi} \equiv \alpha |\dot{\varphi}| / (2 \Lambda H )$. The difference between Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx_varphi} and Eq.~\eqref{review:scalar_strong} is now obvious: in terms of the canonical field $\varphi$ in the Einstein frame, the introduction of a non-minimal coupling to gravity implies that the coupling to the gauge fields is altered as $\dot \varphi \mapsto \dot \varphi/\sqrt{K}$ and hence all effects sourced by the gauge fields are suppressed as $K$ is increased. This can be traced back to the choice of coupling the Chern-Simons term to the canonically normalized field $\phi_0$ in Jordan frame in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:jordan_frame}.
	
	\item In the minimally coupled case with monotonically increasing $\epsilon_H$, Eq.~\eqref{review:scalar_strong} holds from some critical value until the end of inflation. Now, if $K(\phi_0)$ strongly increases towards the end of inflation, a monotonic growth of $\epsilon_H$ no longer implies a monotonic growth of $\xi \propto \sqrt{\epsilon_H/K(\phi_0)}$, see Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:epsilon_H}. Consequently, $\xi$ can be strongly suppressed towards the end of inflation, shutting off the tachyonic instability for the gauge fields. In particular after the usual nearly scale invariant power spectrum of slow-roll inflation at CMB scales and the following gauge-field induced increase, we can achieve another regime with $ b \simeq 1$ and thus $\Delta^2_s (k)$ is much smaller than the prediction of Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx}.\footnote{Note that Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_strong_approx} only holds for $b \gg 1$. For $b \simeq 1$, a reduction in $\xi$ leads to an (exponential) reduction in the scalar power spectrum.} In this setup, the scalar power spectrum thus features a bump. As discussed in~\cite{Clesse:2015wea} such a particular shape for the spectrum can be extremely interesting for the generation of PBHs. A detailed discussion of this topic is carried out in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs}.

	\item The analysis performed here is complementary to the proposal of Ref.~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw}, where a bump in the scalar spectrum (and hence in the PBH spectrum) is achieved based on the action~\eqref{review:action_pseudoscalar}. Instead of introducing a non-minimal coupling to gravity as we do here, they instead modify the scalar potential so that the velocity of the inflaton (and hence the parameter $\xi$) is reduced in the last stages of inflation. On the contrary, after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame and a canonical normalization of the inflaton field, our scalar potential is essentially featureless. The non-trivial evolution of $\xi$ in this frame is sourced by the coupling between the inflaton and gauge fields.
\end{itemize}

Before concluding this section briefly discuss the spectrum $\Delta_t^2$ of GWs that are generated in these generalized models of inflation. In order to compute the shape of the spectrum we  start once again by considering the linearized Einstein equation. In particular, it can be expressed as in Eq.~\eqref{review:linearized_einstein}, where $T_{\mu\nu}$ only depends on the gauge fields.\footnote{Notice that $\sqrt{-g} \phi F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} $ does not depend on $g_{\mu \nu}$ and $h^{ij}\partial_i \phi \partial_j \phi = 0$ at first order.} Moreover, as \begin{equation}
 \sqrt{-g_J} \, g_J^{\mu \rho} g_J^{\nu \sigma} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\rho \sigma} = \sqrt{-g} \, g^{\mu \rho} g^{\nu \sigma} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\rho \sigma}  \ , 
\end{equation}
the source term for GWs is not affected by the presence of a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity. As a consequence the spectrum of GWs is once again given by Eq.~\eqref{review:OmegaGW}. However, it is crucial to stress that while the expression of the spectrum has exactly the dependence on $\xi$ as in Sec.~\ref{sec:review}, the evolution of $\xi$ is now expected to be different and thus (consistently with the examples shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}) we expect the spectrum to be different.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Moduli fields and hidden sectors are ubiquitous in string compactifications. It is important to develop an understanding of their implications
for phenomenology and examine the generic predictions. One such implication is {\it moduli cosmology} \cite{mod1, mod2, modr}.
For a large class of models, moduli fields experience vacuum misalignment as a result of inflation.  This leads to epoch(s) in the history of the
Universe where the energy density of the Universe is dominated by oscillating moduli fields. The Universe reheats with the decay of each species
of modulus field. In cases where one of the moduli
fields is significantly lighter than all others, it can be argued that the decay products of all the heavier moduli are diluted and the decay of the last modulus
effectively sets the initial conditions for the evolution of the Universe.  Most studies of moduli cosmology in the literature have focussed on this case.
However, in general one expects {\it multiple moduli} with masses close to the lightest one. This paper aims  to initiate the study of
moduli cosmology in such settings.
Our focus will be on dark radiation and dark matter abundances. The abundances will be sensitive to the branching ratios of the moduli to all
their decay products (both in the visible and hidden ones). We will quantify the size of branching ratios and the splittings necessary between
the light modulus and the heavier ones for viable phenomenology. 

In string/supergravity models the potential experienced by moduli fields depends on the inflaton vacuum expectation value (VEV) which results in
vacuum misalignment \cite{mismatch}. For a single modulus, $\varphi$, the dynamics in an  FRW background (after canonical normalisation) is
governed by the equation %
$$
\ddot{\varphi} + 3H \dot{\varphi} + {\partial V \over \partial{\varphi}} = 0 \,,
$$
%
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $V$ is the scalar potential. The form of the above equation implies
that the modulus remains pinned to its initial displacement $\varphi^{\rm in}$ till the Hubble constant falls below its mass. After this, it begins
to oscillate about its post-inflationary minimum; the associated energy density redshifts like matter. Finally the modulus decays, the Universe is injected
with its decay products. Typically moduli interact with Planck suppressed interactions and their lifetime is approximately given by 
%
$$
   t  \sim   { m^2_{\rm pl}  \over m_{\varphi}^3 } \, ,
$$
%
where $m_{\rm pl} = 2.43 \times 10^{18} \, \text{GeV}$ is the reduced Planck mass. Thus the amount of time available for the dilution of the decay products of a modulus is determined  by its mass. This makes the cosmology sensitive
to the moduli mass spectrum. To proceed, we assume that the mass spectrum is that of a generic model. Let us outline these assumptions (and the basis for these).
Moduli masses are determined by the potential
%
$$
     V = e^{{\mathcal{K}}} \left( \mathcal{K}^{i \bar{j}} D_{i} W D_{\bar{j}}  \overline{W} -  3 |W|^2 \right),
$$
%
where $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ are the \Kahler and superpotentials of the model and the derivatives are the \Kahler covariant derivatives.
The gravitino mass is given by 
%
$$
  m_{3/2} = \langle e^{\mathcal{K}/2} |W| \rangle \, .
$$
%
In the presence of a large number of hidden sectors\footnote{Consistency requirements
often force a large number of hidden sectors in string compactifications, see e.g.,  \cite{hidden, hreview}.},  one expects that supersymmetry breaking
takes place in a sector that communicates with the standard model via interactions of gravitational strength (see e.g \cite{MSUGRA, rewsbtwo, pk, douglas}).
In general there will also be moduli which interact with the supersymmetry breaking sector with interactions of the same strength; thus 
the generic expectation for these moduli is that their masses are approximately at the scale of the gravitino mass (which, in our case, is also the
mass scale of the visible sector superpartners). In summary, our setup  will consist of multiple moduli
with masses of order the lightest one\footnote{Situations where the lightest modulus is much lighter than all others can naturally arise if a
symmetry principle is operational such as in the Large Volume Scenario \cite{bala}.} with couplings of gravitational strength  to the visible and hidden sectors.


Dark radiation poses a serious challenge for moduli cosmology. Moduli decaying to radiation in hidden sectors or light axions lead to dark radiation.
Given the strong observational constraints on dark radiation \cite{planck}, these can be disastrous for phenomenology. Even in the case of one light
modulus, the constraints require that the constructions are special so that the dangerous decay channels are suppressed \cite{drst}.
The problem is amplified with multiple moduli, as each one of them can in principle decay to dark radiation. Tuning the constructions so that all
the dangerous channels have small branching ratios seems highly unnatural. In this work, we do not assume such unnatural tuning, and quantify
the splitting necessary between the lightest modulus and a heavy modulus so that dark radiation produced as a result of the decay of a heavier
modulus is sufficiently diluted. We find that the splitting necessary is not large, so need not be considered as imposing a strong constraint on
 the spectrum. 



We next turn to dark matter. There are
various scenarios to produce dark matter in moduli cosmology (see e.g. \cite{mdm, ann, pk, modr}).  We will focus on the simplest case --  
dark matter produced as a result of decay of the moduli. We find that in the absence of annihilation processes, dark matter is overproduced
(the dilution mechanism for dark radiation discussed in the previous paragraph does not work for dark matter). We propose a viable scenario where
dark matter annihilates into dark radiation promptly
which in turn gets diluted by the mechanism discussed previously leading to realistic abundance. 
   
  
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Two Moduli}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The essential features of our analysis can be captured by considering a model with two moduli. Thus, we carry out our analysis in the main
text considering a system with only two moduli (for completeness we discuss aspects of the many moduli case in Appendix \ref{Nmoduli}).
We denote the moduli by $\varphi_{\rm 1}$ and $\varphi_{\rm 2}$ and their masses by $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively (with  $m_1 < m_2$).
Assuming only gravitational couplings, the life time of the moduli fields is of the order
$m_{\rm pl}^2/m_{\varphi_i}^3 \approx (16 \TeV / m_{\varphi_i})^3 \, \text{sec}$. This must be less than the age of the Universe at the time
of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) so as not to spoil the successes of BBN \cite{mod1}. Thus $m_{1,2}$ must be
larger than $\sim$ 50 -100 TeV. We take $m_{1} \sim 50 \TeV$ as a benchmark value, and assume that $m_2$  is of the order of $m_1$ (but larger).


Following the arguments in \cite{mismatch}, we assume that during inflation the (canonically normalised) fields 
$\varphi_{1,\, 2}$ get a displacement of the order of $m_{\rm pl}$ from their late-time minima. After the end of inflation the Hubble parameter ($H$)
decreases with time. When $H \lesssim m_2 (m_1)$, $\varphi_2 (\varphi_1)$ starts oscillating around its minimum. 
We define the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]  $\rho_{\rm 2,in} (\rho_{\rm 1,in})$ : energy density stored in the field $\varphi_2 (\varphi_1)$ when it starts oscillating;
\item[]  $H_{\rm 2,in} (H_{\rm 1,in})$ : Hubble parameter when $\varphi_2 (\varphi_1)$ starts oscillating; recall that $H_{\rm i,in} \sim m_i$;
\item[]  $a_{\rm 2,in} (a_{\rm 1,in})$ : scale factor when $\varphi_2 (\varphi_1)$ starts oscillating.
\end{itemize}
%

\begin{figure}[!h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Fig1.png}
\caption{A sketch of the time evolution of the Universe in the presence of two moduli.}
\end{figure}
%%
%
Once $\varphi_2$ starts oscillating, the energy density associated with the initial displacement $\rho_{\rm 2, in}$ redshifts as matter, and quickly
dominates the energy density of the Universe. Thus the evolution is well approximated by assuming matter domination. 
When the Hubble parameter decreases to $H \sim \Gamma_2 \sim m_2^3/m_{\rm pl}^2$, the heavy modulus decays. Let us denote the
branching ratios of the decay of $\varphi_2$ to
dark matter, dark radiation, and the visible sector by ${\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm}$, ${\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr}$ and ${\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis}$ respectively. 
 The dark radiation and dark matter densities just after the decay of $\varphi_2$ are then given by\footnote{We assume the decay to be instantaneous.}
 
 \begin{eqnarray}
\label{dr22}
\rho_{\rm dr}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}} &=& \rho_{2, {\rm in} } \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr} \,, \\ 
\label{dm22-old}
\rho_{\rm dm}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}} &=& \rho_{2, {\rm in} } \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm} \,, \\
\label{vis22}
\rho_{\rm vis}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}} &=& \rho_{2, {\rm in} } \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have used the fact that, in the matter dominated era, the ratio of the scale factors at time $t_{A}$ and $t_{B}$ is related to the ratio
of the Hubble parameters  by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \frac{a(t_B)}{a(t_A)} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{H(t_A)}{H(t_B)} \right)^2 \, .  
\end{eqnarray}
%


Note that, unless the mass of the dark matter particles are too close to $m_2/2$, they will be relativistic at the time of production.
In the set-up under consideration, it is natural to have the dark matter to arise from the hidden sector with a mass not much less than the
moduli mass scale (see for example, \cite{bob,bob1} for motivations for dark matter as hidden sector LSP). When needed, we will use a benchmark value
of approximately a TeV. 



The number density of the dark matter particles at production can now be written as (assuming 2-body decay)
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{dm22}
n_{\rm dm}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}} &=& \frac{2 \rho_{\rm dm}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}}}{m_2} \,.
\end{eqnarray}



Let us determine the equation of state of the Universe right after the decay of $\varphi_2$ ($H \sim \Gamma_2$).
At this stage,  the density of non-relativistic matter is  given by the contribution from the oscillations of the modulus $\varphi_1$ only.
This can be written as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^{\rm mat}|_{\varphi_2 \rm{decay}}   &=& \rho_{\rm \textrm 1,  in} \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_1} \right)^2 = \cr
&=& \frac{1}{2}m_{\rm pl}^2 m_1^2 \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_1} \right)^2 = \cr
&=& \frac{1}{2}m_{\rm pl}^2 \Gamma_2^2  \,,
\label{matden}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where in going from the first line to the second, we have set the initial displacement of $\varphi_1$ to be of the order of $m_{\rm pl}$.
Similarly, the energy density of radiation at that time is 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^{\rm rad}|_{\rm{ \varphi_2 decay}} &=& \rho_{\rm 2, in } \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2 \,
({\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm}) = \cr
&=& \frac{1}{2}m_{\rm pl}^2 m_2^2 \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2 \,
({\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm}) = \cr
&=&    \frac{1}{2}m_{\rm pl}^2  \Gamma_2^2 \, ({\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr} + {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm}) \,.
\label{radden} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
Comparing Eq. \eqref{matden} and Eq. \eqref{radden}, we see that  the Universe is at an epoch of matter-radiation equality
at $\varphi_2$ decay, and thus becomes matter dominated soon after the decay of $\varphi_2$. 


After the decay of $\varphi_2$, the Universe evolves adiabatically until the decay of $\varphi_1$. This occurs when $H \sim \Gamma_1$.
Given the results of the previous paragraph, we take the epoch between the decay of the two moduli to be matter dominated.
As described in the introduction, a sizeable branching fraction of the decay of $\varphi_1$ to dark radiation is disastrous, thus we
assume that this is negligible. However, the contribution from the decay of the heavier moduli can in principle also be significant, and demanding negligible
branching ratios of all the heavier moduli to dark radiation seems too stringent a requirement. Thus it is natural to take a non-negligible branching ratio
of the heavier modulus to dark radiation, and study possible mechanisms 
so as to get viable phenomenology.

Let us denote the branching ratios of $\varphi_1$ to dark matter and visible sectors by ${\cal B}_{\rm 1,dm}$ and ${\cal B}_{\rm 1,vis}$ respectively.
We will now compute the energy densities of the various components after the decay of $\varphi_1$. As these are the energy densities
right after the last reheating epoch, we denote them with a superscript ${\textrm{{``rh"}}}$.



 \noindent \underline{Dark radiation:} Dark radiation dilutes as $a^{-4}(t)$ in the epoch between the decay of the two moduli. Making use of Eq. \eqref{dr22}
we have (see appendix~\ref{app-A})

%
\bel{drrh}
\rho_{\rm dr}^{\rm rh} = \rho_{\rm dr}|_ {\rm \varphi_2 \, decay} \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{8/3}  = 
\rho_{\rm 2, in} \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr}    \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{8/3} \,. \\ 
\end{equation}
%
%

\noindent \underline{Dark Matter:} Dark matter receives contributions from the decay of both the moduli. Since, there is no annihilation the
number density of dark matter produced from the decay of $\varphi_2$ dilutes as $a^{-3}(t)$ in the epoch between the decay of the two moduli.
Thus, using Eq. \eqref{dm22} we find that the contribution to the dark matter number density from the decay of $\varphi_2$ at the time of $\varphi_1$ decay is given by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
n_{\rm dm}^ {(2), \rm rh} &=&  n_{\rm dm}|_ {\rm \varphi_2 \, decay}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^2 = \cr
&=& \rho_{\rm 2, in} \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^2 \frac{2}{m_2} = \cr
&=&  \frac{1}{2} m_{\rm pl}^2 \, \Gamma_1^2  \, {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dm} \frac{2}{m_2} \,. \label{nDM2rh}
\end{eqnarray}
%


Similarly, the contribution from the decay of $\varphi_1$ is
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{dm-justify}
n_{\rm dm}^ {(1), \rm rh} &=&  \frac{\rho_{\rm 1, in}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{m_1} \right)^2 \, {\cal B}_{\rm 1,dm} }{m_1/2} = \cr
&=&  \frac{1}{2} m_{\rm pl}^2 \, \Gamma_1^2  \, {\cal B}_{\rm 1,dm} \frac{2}{m_1} \,.
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%
%
Note that there is a mild hierarchy, $m_1/m_2$, between the two contributions. 
Now, let us turn to the visible sector. 


\noindent \underline{Visible Sector:} The visible sector gets contributions from the decay of both the moduli. It dilutes as $a^{-4}(t)$ in the epoch between the 
decays of the two moduli. Using Eq. \eqref{vis22}, we find
%
 \begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{\rm vis}^{\rm rh} &=&  \rho_{\rm vis}|_ {\rm \varphi_2 \, decay} \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{8/3} +
\rho_{\rm 1,osc}|_ {\rm \varphi_1 \, decay}  \, {\cal B}_{\rm 1,vis} = \\
&=& \rho_{\rm 2, in} \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis}    \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{8/3} +
\rho_{\rm 1, in}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{m_1} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 1,vis}  \,.
 \label{visrh}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Taking again the initial displacements of the fields to be of the order $m_{\rm pl}$,  the reheating temperature of the visible sector can be
easily obtained from Eq. \eqref{visrh}. We get
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{vt}
T_{\rm rh} =  \left( \frac{\rho_{\rm vis}^{\rm rh} }{\hat{g}_{\rm vis}(T_{\rm rh} ) \, \pi^2/30} \right)^{1/4} \approx 13 \MeV 
\left( \frac{{\cal B}_{\rm 1,vis}+ (m_1/m_2)^2 {\cal B}_{\rm 2,vis}}{\hat{g}_{\rm vis}(T_{\rm rh})/10}  \right)^{1/4} \left(\frac{m_1}{100 \TeV}\right)^{3/2} \,.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Note that, the contribution from the decay of $\varphi_2$ is smaller than that from the decay of $\varphi_1$ by a factor of
$\left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{2/3} \sim \left ({ m_1 \over m_2} \right)^2$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Observables}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the previous section, we have computed three energy densities: the energy density of the visible sector at the end of reheating $(\rho^{\rm rh}_{\rm vis})$,
the energy density of dark radiation at the end of reheating $(\rho^{\rm rh}_{\rm dr})$ and the energy density of dark matter at the end of reheating
$(\rho^{\rm rh}_{\rm dm})$. Next, let us use these to compute cosmological observables in the `two moduli' model.

  
%
\subsection{$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of decoupling of the neutrinos} 
\label{droo}

The quantity $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of decoupling of the neutrinos is defined to be the ratio of the energy density in dark radiation and
the energy density in one species of neutrino at the time of decoupling,
%
\bel{ndef}
  \Delta N_{\rm eff}  = { 3  \rho_{\rm dr} ( t_{\nu}) \over \rho_{\nu}  (t_{\nu}) } =  { 43  \over 7 } {   \rho_{\rm dr} ( t_{\nu}) \over \rho_{\rm vis}  (t_{\nu}) },
\end{equation}
%
where $t_{\nu}$ denotes the time of decoupling of neutrinos. Let us begin by expressing this in terms of  $\rho_{\rm rh}^{\rm vis}$ and $\rho_{\rm rh}^{\rm dr}$
(which we have computed in the previous section). Assuming no  significant change in the number of degrees of freedom in dark radiation between
the time of last reheating and the decoupling of neutrinos, we have:
%
\bel{abc}
  \rho_{\rm dr}(t_{\nu}) =   \rho_{\rm dr}^{\rm rh} { a^{4} (t_{\rm rh} ) \over a^{4} ( t_{\rm \nu} ) }.
\end{equation}
%
We also have for the visible sector
%
\bel{visr}
   \rho_{\rm vis}(t_{\nu}) = \rho_{\rm vis}^{\rm rh} {  \hat{g} ( T_{\nu} )  T_{\nu}^4 \over \hat{g}( T_{\rm rh}) T_{\rm rh}^4 } \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $T_{\nu}$ is the temperature of the visible sector\footnote{All temperatures and the $\hat g$ factor quoted are for the visible sector.} at the time of
decoupling of the neutrinos, and $\hat g (T)$ is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the visible sector at temperature $T$.
Ratios of the temperatures can be related to the ratio of the scale factors by making use of the conservation of
entropy in the visible sector,
%
\bel{ento}
a^{3}(t_{\rm rh}) \hat g (T_{\rm rh}) T^3_{\rm rh}  = a^{3}(t_{\rm \nu}) \hat g (T_{\rm \nu}) T^3_{\rm \nu} \, .
\end{equation}
%
Combining Eq.s \eqref{ndef}, \eqref{abc}, \eqref{visr}, and \eqref{ento} we have
%
\bel{drint}
 \Delta N_{\rm eff} = { 43 \over 7}  {  \rho_{\rm dr}^{\rm rh} \over  \rho_{\rm vis}^{\rm rh} } { {\hat g}^{1/3} ( T_{\nu} ) \over
 {\hat g}^{1/3} (T_{\rm rh} ) } \, .
 \end{equation}
%
%{\red 
Plugging in the results from the previous section and taking $\hat g(T_{\rm rh}) \approx \hat g(T_\nu) \approx 10$, one finds (taking the leading
contribution i.e., the second term in Eq.~\ref{visrh})
% 
\bel{numneff}
   \Delta N_{\rm eff} = { 43 \over 7}  {{ \rho_{\rm 2,in}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_2}{m_2} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr}    \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2} \right)^{8/3}} \over {\rho_{\rm 1,in}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{m_1} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{1,vis}} }.
 \end{equation}
%
Taking the displacements to be of the order of $m_{\rm pl}$, we get 
%
\bel{numneffin}
  \Delta N_{\rm eff}  \approx  6.14 {  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr}  \over {\cal B}_{1,vis} } \left( { m_1 \over m_2} \right)^2.
\end{equation}
%
Alternatively,
%
\bel{ratfin} 
  m_2 =    {2.48 \over { \sqrt{\Delta N_{\rm eff}  } } }\sqrt{ {  {\cal B}_{\rm 2,dr}  \over {\cal B}_{\rm1,vis} } } m_1.
\end{equation}
%}
%
This implies that the dark radiation produced from the decay of heavier moduli can be diluted so as to be consistent with
the observations even if the mass of $\varphi_2$ is only a few times that of the mass of $\varphi_1$. 
For example, $m_2 \sim 5 m_1$ leads to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.25$ (for ${\mathcal O (1})$ branching ratios) which is
consistent with the current bound from CMB \cite{planck}. The mechanism is quite robust; even $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.03$, 
which might be achieved by the CMB Stage-IV experiment \cite{Abazajian:2016yjj}, requires $m_2 \sim 15 m_1$.
A similar conclusion
holds for cases with multiple moduli, which we discuss in Appendix~\ref{Nmoduli}. Thus, a small split in the moduli spectrum can prevent
dark radiation overproduction.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dark matter abundance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As described in the previous section, dark matter is produced from the decay of both the moduli. Let us examine the contribution
from the decay of the heavier modulus to the dark matter abundance if there is no annihilation. To do this, we compute
the ratio of number density of dark matter produced from the decay of the heavier modulus and the visible sector entropy density.
Using Eq. \eqref{nDM2rh}  and 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{sfor}
s = {2 \pi^{2} \over 45} g_{\rm vis} (T_{\rm rh}) T_{\rm rh}^{3} \,,
\end{equation}
%
we get, 
\begin{equation}
\label{ns}
 { n^{(2), \rm{rh}}_{\rm dm} \over s } = {3 \over 2} { \hat{g}_{\rm vis}(T_{\rm rh}) \over {g}_{\rm vis}(T_{\rm rh}) } {T_{\rm rh} \over m_{1} } \,
  \frac{{\cal B}_{\rm 2, dm }}{{\cal B}_{\rm 1, vis } }  \left( {m_1 \over
 m_2} \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
Recall that observations set
%
\begin{equation}
\label{dmo}
  {n_{\rm dm} \over s }\bigg{|}_{\rm Obs} = 5 \times 10^{-12} \left( { {\rm 100~GeV}  \over  m_{\chi} } \right) \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $m_\chi$ is the mass of the dark matter. 
Taking $m_1 \approx 100 \, \rm TeV$, $m_\chi \approx 100 \, \rm GeV$ and the reheat temperature from Eq. \eqref{vt},  we find
that 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{ns2}
 { n^{(2), \rm{rh}}_{\rm dm} \over s } \approx  10^{5}  \, \frac{{\cal B}_{\rm 2, dm }}{{\cal B}_{\rm 1, vis } }  \left( {m_1 \over
 m_2} \right)    {n_{\rm dm} \over s }\bigg{|}_{\rm Obs}  \, .
 \end{equation}
 %
For $m_1/m_2 \sim 0.1$, the contribution from the heavy modulus is approximately four orders of magnitude larger than the
observed value. 



 
\section{Dark matter dilution mechanism}
\label{dmdilm}

As we have seen in the previous section, in the absence of annihilation processes  dark matter  is generically overproduced.
It is interesting to ask whether there is a natural way to reduce the abundance of dark matter produced form the decay of the heavier
moduli. 
%
We will argue that such a mechanism exists if the dark matter produced can annihilate \footnote{Annihilation of dark matter produced from decay of moduli
has been previously invoked in \cite{ann, pk}.} to dark radiation. This is facilitated if the hidden sector from which the dark matter arises also contains dark radiation. 
The dark matter  that survives after the self-annihilation can have the correct abundance. Additional dark radiation is produced, but this is diluted 
as described before, if the annihilation processes are prompt and cease well before the decay of the lightest modulus.


 Since dark matter annihilation has to be such that the dark radiation produced gets diluted, we will demand that
 $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm{ann}}$ of the annihilation process is large enough so that the dark matter produced immediately
 annihilates into dark radiation. This is the case if 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{condii}
n_{\rm dm}|_ {\varphi_2 \, {\rm decay}} \langle\sigma v \rangle_{\rm{ann}} > H(t_{\varphi_{\rm 2} \rm{decay}}) \,.
\end{equation}

Making use of Eq. \eqref{dm22} in Eq. \eqref{condii} we find 
%
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{B}_{2, \rm dm} m_{2}^2\langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm{ann}} > 1 \,.
\end{equation}
%
The annihilation stops approximately when the annihilation rate becomes of order of Hubble. At that point, the number density, ${\hat n}_{\rm dm}$, is given
by  
%
\begin{equation}
{\hat n}_{\rm dm}  \simeq \frac{H(t_{\varphi_{\rm 2} \rm{decay}})}{\langle\sigma v \rangle_{\rm{ann}}} \simeq
\frac{ m_{2}^3}{\langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm ann} \, m_{\rm pl}^2} \, .
\end{equation}
%
Redshifting  this abundance till the decay of the lightest modulus gives
\begin{equation}
{\hat n}_{\rm dm}^{(2), \rm rh}  \simeq \frac{ m_{1}^3}{\langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm ann} \, m_{\rm pl}^2} \left(\frac{m_1}{m_2}\right)^3 \,.
\end{equation}
%
 This has to be compared to
the contribution of the decay of the heavy modulus to dark matter number density at the time of decay of the light one without the annihilation
process (which we defined
to be  $n_{\rm dm}^{\rm(2)  rh} $ in Eq. \eqref{nDM2rh}),
%
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm dm}^{\rm(2), rh}  \simeq \mathcal{B}_{2, \rm dm} { {m_1}^6 \over {m_{\rm pl}^2} } {1 \over m_2}\,.
\end{equation}
%
The ratio is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RatioAbundances}
\frac{{\hat n}_{\rm dm}^{(2), \rm rh}}{n_{\rm dm}^{\rm(2), rh} } 
 \simeq
\frac{1}{\mathcal{B}_{2, \rm dm}} \, \frac{1}{m_2^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm ann}}  \, .
\end{equation}
%
Dark matter produced is expected to become non-relativistic very quickly \cite{ann,Arcadi:2011ev}. In this case, if one roughly estimates
the cross section to be $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm ann} \simeq g^4/m_{\chi}^2$ then
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RatioAbundances2}
\frac{{\hat n}_{\rm dm}^{(2), \rm rh}}{n_{\rm dm}^{\rm(2), rh} } \simeq 
 \frac{1}{g^4 \,\mathcal{B}_{2, \rm dm}} \, \left(\frac{m_\chi}{m_{2}}\right)^2  \, .
\end{equation}
%
Thus, the dark matter overproduction problem can be alleviated if there is approximately two orders of hierarchy between
$m_\chi$ and $m_{2}$ (which can be satisfied if $m_\chi \sim$ 100 GeV - TeV as taken in the previous section). Such a hierarchy
can be obtained if there is a loop suppression between the masses generated for the fermions and the scalars, see for example
\cite{Randall:1998uk,Acharya:2008zi,bob}.
%
Since the ratio in Eq. \eqref{eq:RatioAbundances} scales inversely with the annihilation cross-section, having dark
radiation in the same sector as the dark matter helps reducing the dark matter abundance.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Moduli fields are a generic feature of string compactifications.  Their vacuum misalignment 
can have a significant impact on cosmology. Another generic feature of string compactifications is the existence of
hidden sectors. It is important to understand if these two ingredients have any implications
for cosmology. As it is natural to expect multiple moduli at the gravitino mass scale, we have
initiated the study of modular cosmology in the presence of multiple moduli. We have focused  on
dark radiation and dark matter abundances. For dark radiation, even a small split between the lightest
modulus and the heavier ones dilutes the radiation produced from the heavier moduli, so that
they do not lead to overproduction of dark radiation. For dark matter, contributions from the 
decay of heavier moduli leads to overproduction in the absence of annihilation processes. We 
have seen that there is an natural solution to this problem -- fast annihilation of the dark matter to
dark radiation in its sector. With this, if the heavier moduli with sizable branching fractions to dark
matter are two or three orders of magnitude heavier than the dark matter particle, then there is no over
production of dark matter. This mild hierarchy seems to be necessary for viable phenomenology.

Of course, there are many  directions to explore. 
It will be interesting to study in detail the implications of our scenario for direct detection experiments.  Our analysis has
relied on generic expectations on the spectrum and initial displacements of the moduli fields, and  it would be interesting to carry out
studies of explicit string constructions.

\section{Multiple Moduli}
\label{Nmoduli}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is easy to generalise our discussion to $N>2$ moduli (with N not very large). For $N$ moduli $\varphi_i$ of mass $m_i$, the entire epoch
between the oscillation of the first modulus to the decay of the last modulus can be approximated to be matter dominated. If each of the
modulus has order one branching fraction to the visible sector, then the visible sector energy density at the time of the last reheating is dominated
by the contribution from the decay of the lightest modulus. 

Dark radiation produced from the decay of the $i^{\rm th}$ modulus make a contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ (at the time of decoupling
of neutrinos) which is given by
%
$$
   \Delta N^{i}_{\rm eff}  \approx  6.14 {  {\cal B}_{\rm i,dr}  \over {\cal B}_{\rm 1,vis} } \left( { m_1 \over m_i} \right)^2,
$$
%
where ${\cal B}_{\rm i,dr}$ is the branching fraction of the $i^{\rm th}$ modulus to dark radiation. Thus, the contributions
from the heavier moduli drop inversely with square of their masses, and do not pose a serious problem for $N_{\rm eff}$.

In the absence of annihilation processes, dark matter produced from the decay of the $i^{\rm th}$ modulus contributes to
the dark matter number density at the time of the last reheating by an amount
%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
n_{\rm dm}^ {(i), \rm rh} &=&  n_{\rm dm}|_ {\rm \varphi_i \, decay}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_i} \right)^2 \cr
&=& \rho_{\rm i, in} \left( \frac{\Gamma_i}{m_i} \right)^2  {\cal B}_{\rm i,dm}  \left( \frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_i} \right)^2 \frac{2}{m_i} \cr
&=&  \frac{1}{2} m_{\rm pl}^2 \, \Gamma_1^2  \, {\cal B}_{\rm i,dm} \frac{2}{m_i}  \label{nDMirh}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Evolving this to the time of decay of $\varphi_{1}$, the ratio of this contribution to the entropy density
is 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{nsii}
 { n^{(i), \rm{rh}}_{\rm dm} \over s } \approx  10^{5}  \, \frac{{\cal B}_{\rm i, dm }}{{\cal B}_{\rm 1, vis } }  \left( {m_1 \over
 m_i} \right)    {n_{\rm dm} \over s }\bigg{|}_{\rm Obs}  \, ,
 \end{equation}
 %
%
which leads to dark matter over abundance. On the other hand, in the presence of annihilation processes, as described in section
\ref{dmdilm}, the number density at the time of the last reheating (${\hat n}_{\rm dm}^{(i), \rm rh}$) is reduced,  its ratio to ${ n^{(i), \rm{rh}}_{\rm dm} }$ is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RatioAbundancesappi}
\frac{{\hat n}_{\rm dm}^{(i), \rm rh}}{n_{\rm dm}^{\rm(i), rh} } 
 \simeq
\frac{1}{\mathcal{B}_{i, \rm dm}} \, \frac{1}{m_i^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle_{\rm ann}}  \, .
\end{equation}
%
Thus, in summary, the qualitative picture discussed in the two moduli case does not change in the presence of many moduli.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Quantum transitions among different maximally symmetric gravitational vacuum states have been thoroughly studied for almost 40 years starting from the original work of Coleman and De Luccia (CDL)~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} in which, arguing from analogy with the flat space case that makes use of Euclidean instanton methods, they gave an expression for the probability amplitude for decay from de Sitter (dS) space to Minkowski ($\mathcal{M}$) space and from the latter to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In~\cite{Brown:1988kg} Brown and Teitelboim (BT),  by considering explicitly the role of a nucleated brane, were able to discuss further tunnelling possibilities such as up as well as down-tunnelling among dS spaces with different cosmological constants  as well as transitions from dS to AdS. However,
the transition from Minkowski spacetime to dS was not allowed in their formalism. This possibility was later considered by Farhi, Guth and Guven (FGG)~\cite{Farhi:1989yr}, inspired by the possibility of creating an inflationary universe `in the laboratory'\footnote{Please note that the creation of baby universes from Minkowski should not be thought as an instability of Minkowski spacetime since the original Minkowski spacetime remains after nucleating the dS bubble.} (see also Blau, Guth and Guendelman (BGG)~\cite{Blau:1986cw} and references therein). Their analysis starts from an eternal Schwarzschild black hole ($\mathcal S$), and involves a Euclidean instanton that mediates the transition. 
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{EffectivePotential.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Pictorial representation of the effective potential associated to a Schwarzschild to dS transition, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialSdS}. Region I and III are the classically allowed regions for the motion of the bubble wall, while Region II is the classically forbidden region. The horizontal lines correspond to different wall trajectories and $R_{\rm i}$ and $R_{\rm o}$ (the subscripts `i' and `o' stand for `inner' and `outer') correspond to two classical turning points of the wall trajectory. Type (a) is a bubble that can classically expand until $R = R_{\rm i}$ and then collapse to a singularity. Type (b) contracts from spatial infinity, reflects off the second turning  point and then expands back to infinity. In the quantum version classical trajectory (a) can tunnel to (b). In the dS to dS transitions the first turning point disappears, see Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialdStodS}.\label{fig:EffectivePotential}}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

In the BGG discussion the trajectories of the bubble wall with respect to the effective potential were classified into five main types, according to the value of the mass $M$ of the black hole. We have omitted all but the ones relevant for our discussion since we are ultimately interested in the $M\rightarrow 0$ limit. In Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectivePotential} the trajectory (a) corresponds to  a  bubble coming out of the white hole singularity, bouncing off the turning point $R_{\rm i}$ and then collapsing to the black hole. Trajectory (b) represents a wall coming in from infinity, reflecting off the second turning point and then expanding back to infinity. Trajectory (a) by itself does not allow for an ever expanding universe. Trajectory (b) on the other hand allows for a continuously expanding universe but suffers from the Penrose theorem in the sense that the wall surface is an anti-trapped surface and cannot escape a singularity (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Trajectories}). Selecting a point $\textrm{P}$ on the left hand side of the wall trajectory, i.e. within the dS patch, any pair of orthogonal ingoing geodesics either hit the singularity or past asymptotic infinity behind the horizon of the observer on the right hand side. However, FGG argued that tunnelling between these trajectories can result in the spontaneous nucleation of an expanding bubble at the second turning point $R_{\rm o}$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:CompositePenrose}. The important feature of the given setup enabling type (a) trajectories to be buildable is the  choice of the range of the mass parameter $M$, such that one of the ingoing geodesics of a two-surface avoids the initial singularity. Since trajectory (a) does not represent an anti-trapped surface, it is in principle `buildable' in a laboratory\footnote{In the sense that it is at least possible to `communicate' with the wall of the bubble from the exterior of the bubble itself, without relying on a black hole singularity.} and through tunnelling allows the nucleation of a bubble in the expanding region (b) that classically would have been `unbuildable'. We note for future reference that in the limit where the black hole mass goes to zero the first turning point disappears while the second one where the bubble is nucleated, remains. This situation is similar to the tunnelling from `nothing' discussion in quantum cosmology~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp}. As we will see later the situation for `tunnelling' between two dS spaces is similar in that there is only one turning point: there is no initial classical motion of the bubble.

\caption{\footnotesize{Composite Penrose diagrams for both (a) (left) and (b) (right) wall trajectories. In each case the wall trajectory (in blue) separates the exterior Schwarzschild geometry (green) and the interior dS (yellow). The dotted black lines in both cases illustrate that the (b) trajectory represents an anti-trapped surface and is subject to Penrose theorem, whereas the (a) trajectory is not and can in principle be created from a non-singular geometry.}\label{fig:Trajectories}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure} 
These results have been subject to criticism in the literature and up to now they are not generally accepted by the community mainly because the instanton involved in the FGG tunnelling process has some peculiar properties, as acknowledged by the authors themselves. However, these results were confirmed by an explicit calculation in the Hamiltonian formalism by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP)~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk}. 

The importance of this issue acquires a new dimension in the context of the string theory landscape in which a huge number of vacua with essentially all possible values of the cosmological constant are allowed and it is important to understand the dynamics of this landscape. Furthermore, in the proposal of Bousso and Polchinski to address the cosmological constant problem~\cite{Bousso:2000xa}, it is necessary that the whole landscape can be populated by quantum transitions. This has been questioned in~\cite{Johnson:2008vn, Aguirre:2009tp} where it is argued that even though transitions among dS vacua are expected, the existence of a runaway solution towards decompactification or vanishing string coupling prevents the transition from being completed. This would then prevent the landscape from being populated. If, however (in the context of string theory), transitions from 10D Minkowski to 4D dS (times a compact space) were allowed, there would be no obstacle to populating the landscape (see also~\cite{Brown:2011ry}). As a first step towards this objective we believe it is important to revisit the original proposals for a Minkowski to dS transition.

In this paper we will  address this question directly by considering 
 the nucleation of baby universes  within the four dimensional
context. We will first review the Hamiltonian argument given by FMP~\cite{Fischler:1989se, Fischler:1990pk} in
support of the claim of Guth and collaborators on the creation of
baby universes from behind the horizon of a black hole configuration~\cite{Blau:1986cw,Farhi:1986ty,Farhi:1989yr}.
While these calculations were somewhat incomplete, since a certain
boundary term was not explicitly worked out (see Sec.~\ref{sec:dSdStransitions}), in the corresponding case of transitions from dS to dS spaces this can indeed be done and explicit formulae obtained as in~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp}. 


Next we compare these calculations with the vacuum transition probabilities obtained by CDL~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} and BT~\cite{Brown:1988kg} using Euclidean instanton methods. In fact the latter paper (which is the one used by Bousso and Polchinski~\cite{Bousso:2000xa}) is more closely related to the current investigation since it involves the nucleation of  a brane as in the string theory case. We find that while CDL/BT gives zero transition probability for up-tunnelling from flat space, the FMP calculation (in agreement with  the calculation of FGG) gives a non-vanishing probability for this. We explicitly compute this amplitude in two independent ways depending on the way we describe Minkowski space: we consider the zero cosmological constant limit of dS and the zero mass limit of the Schwarzschild solution. In the latter case we get a non-vanishing result but in the former case we find a vanishing transition amplitude. 

We explain this discrepancy by arguing that it is due to the use of different relative probabilities. We interpret the CDL/BT expression as coming from the (absolute value squared of the) ratio of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) wave functions for the nucleated spacetime configuration $\mathcal{N}$ to the background spacetime configuration $\mathcal{B}$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RelativeProbability}
\mathcal{P} = \frac{\left|\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}\right|^2}{\left|\Psi_{\mathcal{B}}\right|^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where for instance in the particular case of dS to dS transitions the nucleated spacetime $\mathcal{N}$ is given by two dS spaces joined together by a brane, while $\mathcal{B}$ is a dS bubble, see Sec.~\ref{sec:dSdStransitions}.

The vanishing of the up-tunnelling probability in this case, in the limit in which the cosmological constant of the background dS vanishes (i.e. in the Minkowski limit for the background configuration), is entirely due to the blow up of the Hartle-Hawking (HH) wave function (in the denominator) in such a limit. This reflects the fact that the HH wave function is effectively the exponential of the horizon entropy of dS space, which becomes infinite in the Minkowski limit. On the other hand in the FMP case (i.e. for Schwarzschild to dS transitions, in the limit of $M \rightarrow 0$), while the numerator is the same in the Minkowski limit, the denominator is essentially unity. Thus both calculations are consistent with detailed balance, however with different interpretations of entropy. In the first case with the entropy of Minkowski being  given as the log of the dimension of the Hilbert space that can be built on  the space (and therefore is infinite), while in the second case it is the limit of the horizon entropy of a black hole which goes to zero in the Minkowski limit. This is consistent with the fact that in the latter case which is asymptotically flat, a notion of boundary energy exists which is not the case for dS space. A ratio of the two relative probabilities for up-tunnelling to down-tunnelling is proportional to the ratio of the  exponentials of the entropies of the two initial states. Thus we recover detailed balance for Minkowski to dS transitions and indeed find that there is no inconsistency in having up-tunnelling from Minkowski space.

Please note that in the context of Euclidean instanton calculations \textit{à la} CDL, the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:RelativeProbability} is usually interpreted as the tunnelling rate per unit volume and unit time of the spacetime $\mathcal{N}$ from a spacetime $\mathcal{B}$. For this reason we will loosely refer to $\mathcal{P}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:RelativeProbability} as the probability of tunnelling from the background spacetime $\mathcal{B}$ to the nucleated spacetime $\mathcal{N}$, while strictly speaking we are computing the relative probability of nucleating $\mathcal{N}$ against $\mathcal{B}$ from `nothing'. Of course these computations raise the usual problem related to the role of time in quantum gravity: can these transitions be interpreted as a tunnelling from one spacetime configuration to another one that happens in time? In the case of the FGG/FMP calculation, where the transition is from a Schwarzschild geometry to a dS one, the answer seems to be yes: the tunnelling takes place once the buildable bubble classically expands to its maximum radius. At that point in time it tunnels through a wormhole, disappearing from region I of the black hole geometry and appearing in region III. The relative probability can be interpreted as the probability of getting a bubble of the type (b) (from a bubble of type (a) at its maximum radius) normalised by the probability of remaining with a bubble of the type (a) that just re-collapses to the black hole singularity after having classically reached its maximum radius. In the case of dS to dS (or Minkowski to dS) transitions the interpretation is less clear, due to the absence of an initial classical bubble. We will comment more on this point in due course, see Sec.~\ref{sec:TunnellingProbability}.

We should also mention that the FMP calculation is an exercise in Hamiltonian dynamics (in contrast to the Euclidean calculations of FGG as well as those of CDL and BT), and so should not violate unitarity. There has been a claim in the literature~\cite{Freivogel:2005qh} that it does violate unitarity in the sense that it appears to take a pure state into a mixed state using AdS/CFT arguments. We revisit these arguments and conclude that there should not be an inconsistency since both states can be pure\footnote{We thank Steve Shenker for pointing out this argument.}. Also, even though the instanton calculation of FGG involves a singular configuration, the FMP Hamiltonian calculation has no such problem. Thus we believe that the latter should be taken seriously and as we pointed out above the thermodynamic issues it presents should be addressed as above.

In this paper we also generalise the FMP argument away from the turning point of the tunnelling trajectory. This enables us to 
show the relation to the well-known arguments due to HH and Vilenkin for different wave functions  for creating dS spaces from `nothing'\footnote{For recent discussions of the different proposals for the `wave function of the universe' in terms of solutions to the WDW equation see~\cite{deAlwis:2018sec} and~\cite{Halliwell:2018ejl}.}. Indeed in the case of  the dS to dS transitions there is no initial turning point very much like the case of tunnelling from `nothing'. Also this general discussion resolves the issue related to the sign of the exponent of the wave function (mentioned for instance by Bachlechner~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp}) in that the usual (CDL/BT) tunnelling arguments are recovered from the general solution to the WDW equation by picking the dominant term in both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio defining the relative probability.

In the next Section we start by reviewing the Hamiltonian formalism used by FMP. We introduce the transition amplitudes in terms of relative probabilities and discuss the different cases of transition among dS and Minkowski spacetimes. We finish the Section with a summary comparing the value of the different amplitudes for up- and down-tunnelling. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} we generalise the formalism by computing the wave functions away from the turning points that allows us to properly study the wave function in the regions under and outside the barrier. This is also relevant since the pre-factor of the semi-classical wave function usually blows up at the turning points. The issue of the dominant components of the wave functions contributing to the transition amplitude are addressed. Sec.~\ref{sec:Comparison} is dedicated to comparison with other approaches to the Minkowski to dS transition. We address several concerns that have been raised over the years questioning the validity of the FGG proposal. We conclude that the FGG proposal survives the different challenges and it is robust. In particular we address explicitly the consistency with AdS/CFT and detailed balance. We present our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusions}.

\section{ Vacuum transitions in the Hamiltonian formalism}
\label{sec:4DSummary}

\subsection{Summary of the Hamiltonian formalism}
\label{sec:SummaryHamiltonian}

We consider spherically symmetric configurations so that the metric in four dimensions take the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4DMetric}
ds^{2} = -N_{t}^{2}(t,r)dt^{2}+L^{2}(t,r)(dr+N_{r}dt)^{2}+R^{2}(t,r)d\Omega_{2}^{2} \,,
\end{equation}
where as usual, $d \Omega_2^2 = d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d \phi^2$, $\theta$ and $\phi$ being the angular coordinates on the two-sphere. In the case of a single wall separating two domains, the total action is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:4DAction}
S_{\rm tot} &= \frac{1}{16\pi G}\int_{{\cal M}}d^{4}x\sqrt{g} \,{\cal R}+\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int_{\partial{\cal M}}d^{3}y\sqrt{h} \, K+S_{\rm mat}+S_{\rm W} \equiv \nonumber \\
&\equiv S_{\rm EH} + S_K + S_{\rm mat} + S_{\rm W} \,,
\end{align}
where $\partial \mathcal{M}$ is a time-like boundary, $K$ is the extrinsic curvature and $h$ is the metric induced on the boundary. 
$S_{K}$ is the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term that needs to be added to $S_{\rm EH}$ in order to recover the correct field equation of motion when applying the variational principle. In the above metric the bulk Einstein-Hilbert action becomes\footnote{In the entire paper we denote $x'=\frac{d}{dr}x$ and $\dot{x}=\frac{d}{dt}x$.}
\begin{align}
S_{\rm EH} & = \frac{1}{2G}\int drdt\left[\frac{2}{N_{t}}(N_{r}LR)'(\dot{R}-N_{r}R')-\frac{2}{N_{t}}\partial_{t}(LR)(\dot{R}-N_{r}R')+ \right.\nonumber \\
&\left. +\frac{2}{L}(N_{t}R)'R' +\frac{N_{t}}{L}(L^{2}-R^{\prime 2})+\frac{L}{N_{t}}(\dot{R}-N_{r}R')^{2}\right] \,.
\label{eq:SEH}
\end{align}
The canonically conjugate variables to $L$, $R$ and the Hamiltonian
and momentum of the gravity theory are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:piLR}
\pi_{L} & = \frac{N_{r}R'-\dot{R}}{GN_{t}}R,\,\qquad \pi_{R}=\frac{(N_{r}LR)'-\partial_{t}(LR)}{GN_{t}} \,, \\
\label{eq:Hg}
{\cal H}_{g} & = \frac{GL\pi_{L}^{2}}{2R^{2}}-\frac{G}{R}\pi_{L}\pi_{R}+\frac{1}{2G}\left[\left(\frac{2RR'}{L}\right)^{'}-\frac{R'^{2}}{L}-L\right] \,, \\
\label{eq:Pg}
P_{g} & = R'\pi_{R}-L\pi_{L}' \,.
\end{align}
We assume that the spherical brane is located at $r = \hat{r}$. The induced metric\footnote{We choose the gauge $\sigma^{0} = t$, $\sigma^{1} = \theta$, $\sigma^{2} = \phi$.} can be written as
\begin{equation}
h_{ij} = g_{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial\sigma^{i}}\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial\sigma^{j}}\,, \qquad h_{_{00}}=-N_{t}^{2}+L^{2}(N_{r}+\dot{\hat{r}})^{2} \,,
\end{equation}
and then the determinant takes the simple form
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{h} = 4\pi\hat{R}^{2}\sqrt{h_{00}} \,,
\end{equation}
where the $ \,\, \hat{} \,\,$ denotes that the function $R(r)$ has been evaluated at $r = \hat{r}$. Finally, the domain wall action is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SDW}
S_{{\rm W}}=-4\pi\sigma\int dtdr \, \delta(r-\hat{r})[N_{t}^{2}-L^{2}(N_{r}+\dot{\hat{r}})^{2}]^{1/2} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the tension of the wall, while the matter action is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Sm}
S_{{\rm mat}} = - 4\pi\int dtdr \, L N_{t} R^{2} \, \rho(r)\,, \qquad \rho = \Lambda_{{\rm O}} \,\theta(r - \hat{r}) + \Lambda_{{\rm I}}\, \theta(\hat{r}-r) \,,
\end{equation}
i.e. it just includes a cosmological constant term which takes different values on the two sides of the wall\footnote{Here and in the following we denote by a subscript $\text{I}$ the \textit{internal} region such that $r < \hat{r}$, while we denote by a subscript $\text{O}$ the \textit{outer} region such that $r > \hat{r}$.}. The Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:H}
{\cal H} & = {\cal H}_{g}+4\pi LR^{2}\rho(r)+\delta(r-\hat{r})E=0 \,,\\
\label{eq:P}
P & = P_{g}-\delta(r-\hat{r})\hat{p}=0 \,,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:E and m}
E = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}^{2}}{\hat{L}^{2}}+m^{2}}\,, \qquad m=4\pi\sigma\hat{R}^{2} \,, \qquad \hat{p}=\partial{\cal L}/\partial\dot{\hat{r}} \,,
\end{equation}
and the Lagrangian can be read from Eq.~\eqref{eq:4DAction}. Away from the domain wall (i.e. $r\ne\hat{r}$) we have from the second
constraint,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{\ensuremath{\pi}}_{R} & = & \frac{L}{R'}\pi'_{L}.\label{eq:Pcons}
\end{eqnarray}
Inserting Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pcons} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:H} (for $r\ne\hat{r}$)
we get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{\pi_{L}^{2}}{2R}\right)=\frac{1}{2G^{2}}\frac{d}{dr}\left[R\left(\frac{R'}{L}\right)^{2}-R+\frac{8\pi}{3}G\rho R^{3}\right] \,,
\end{equation}
that translates into the solution
\begin{align}
\label{eq:pi_L}
\pi_{L} & = \eta\frac{R}{G}\left[\frac{R'^{2}}{L^{2}}-A_{\alpha}\right]^{1/2}\,, \quad  \alpha={\rm O}, \,{\rm I}\,, \quad \eta = \pm 1 \,,\\
\label{eq:Aalpha}
A_{\alpha} & = 1-\frac{2GM_{\alpha}}{R}-H_{\alpha}^{2}R^{2}\,, \qquad H_{\alpha}^{2}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\Lambda_{\alpha} \,,
\end{align}
where $M_{\alpha}$ is an integration constant. This of course corresponds to the general solution to the spherically symmetric metric ansatz, i.e Schwarzschild-dS ($\mathcal{S}$dS). If the constant $M_{\alpha} = 0$, $\Lambda_{\alpha} \ne 0$, we have a pure dS solution and if $\Lambda_{\alpha} = 0$, $M_{\alpha} \ne 0$ we have a Schwarzschild black hole. In the static coordinate system with $R$ as one of the coordinates, the spherically symmetric $\mathcal{S}$dS metric takes the static form:
\begin{equation}
ds_\alpha^2=-A_\alpha(R)\, d\tau^2+A_\alpha^{-1}(R)\, dR^2 + R^2\, d\Omega_2^2 \,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Constraints and dynamics of the wall}
The constraints on the domain wall are imposed by integrating
Eq.~\eqref{eq:H} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:P} from $\hat{r}-\epsilon$ to $\hat{r}+\epsilon$ leading to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:I1}
\frac{\hat{R}}{\hat{L}}(R'(\hat{r}+\epsilon)-R'(\hat{r}-\epsilon)) & = -GE \,,\\
\label{eq:I2}
\pi_{L}(\hat{r}+\epsilon)-\pi_{L}(\hat{r}-\epsilon) & = \frac{\hat{p}}{\hat{L}}=0 \,,
\end{align}
where to get the last equality we have transformed to the rest frame
of the wall so that $\hat{p}=0$ and $E = m = 4 \pi \hat{R}^{2} \sigma$. We note for future reference that in the limit $\kappa\rightarrow 0$ , $A_{\rm I} = A_{\rm O}$, i.e. there is not change in the geometry in the absence of the wall.  Combining Eq.~\eqref{eq:I2} with Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L} and then using Eq.~\eqref{eq:I1} gives 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:R'pm}
\frac{R'(\hat{r}\pm\epsilon)}{\hat{L}}=\frac{1}{2\kappa\hat{R}}\left(\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}\right)\mp\frac{\kappa}{2}\hat{R} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have defined 
\begin{equation}
\kappa\equiv4\pi\sigma G=\frac{Gm}{\hat{R}^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'pm} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:piLR} (in the gauge $N_{r}=0$ and $N_t = 1$) one can write an equation of motion for the wall:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EofM}
\dot{\hat{R}}^{2}+V = -1 \,,
\end{equation}
where, depending on the solution chosen in Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'pm}, the potential takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:V}
V & = -\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}})-\kappa^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{2}+(\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}-1) = \\
\label{eq:Valt}
 & = -\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-\hat{A}_{{\rm O}})+\kappa^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{2}+(\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}-1) \,.
\end{align}
So the equation $V=-1$ gives the turning points for the classical
motion of the wall, i.e. the points at $R = R_{\rm i}$ and $R = R_{\rm o}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectivePotential}. At a turning point we see from Eq.~\eqref{eq:V} that $\hat{A}_{{\rm O}}>0$ and from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Valt} that $\hat{A}_{{\rm I}}>0$. The classical turning points for the geometry occur at $\pi_{L}=0$, i.e. (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L}) at
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TurningPoints}
\frac{R'^{2}}{L^{2}} = A(R) = 1-\frac{2MG}{R}-H^{2}R^{2} \,.
\end{equation}
When $r=\hat{r}$ these are the turning points for the wall, i.e.
the solutions of $V = -1$.

\subsection{Wheeler-DeWitt equation and tunnelling probability}
\label{sec:TunnellingProbability}

The problem of computing the tunnelling probability in semiclassical gravity is similar to the tunnelling problem of a barrier potential in usual quantum mechanics. In this context, instead of the Schr\"oedinger equation we need to solve the WDW equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:WDW}
\mathcal{H} \Psi = 0 \,,
\end{equation}
where the wave functional $\Psi$ is a functional of the geometry and a function of the brane position $\hat r$. We employ the WKB approximation, for which the wave function $\Psi$ can be written at leading order in the semi-classical approximation as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralWF}
\Psi = a e^{I} + b e^{- I} \,,
\end{equation}
where, given a configuration with action $S$, we have denoted the combination $iS = I$ and the action $S$ is evaluated on a classical solution. In the following we will refer to both $S$ and $I$ as the `action'. The two solutions are given by $\eta = \pm 1$ corresponding to the two solutions for $\pi_L$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L}.

The problem is qualitatively very different depending on whether the background geometry includes a black hole or not. If it does, the problem is similar to the usual quantum mechanical tunnelling through a potential barrier: as shown in Fig.~\eqref{fig:EffectivePotential}, there are two classically allowed (I and III) and one classically forbidden regions (II). Classically, the wall expands (or contracts) up to a classical turning point and then re-collapses (or re-expands). Quantum mechanically, it can tunnel under the barrier and resurface after the second turning point. The WDW equation has two independent solutions as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} in each of these regions, that need to be matched at the classical turning points. Some of the coefficients $a$ and $b$ (there are two coefficients for each region) can be fixed by imposing boundary conditions. For instance, requiring that there is only an outgoing wave in region III (that amounts to requiring that the nucleated universe is expanding and not contracting, as it happens in the Vilenkin proposal for the creation of a dS bubble from `nothing') gives a relation between the two coefficients of the under the barrier wave function. On the contrary, if there is no boundary condition, in general one of the two solutions (positive or negative exponent) in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} will dominate in each region, depending on the sign of the action $I$. 
The tunnelling  probability in this case can be computed as the ratio between the squared wave function associated to the expanding bubble in the classical Region III and the squared wave function of the expanding bubble in the classical Region I. This can be approximated (up to subtleties that will be addressed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away}) as the ratio
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TunnellingProbabilitySdS}
\mathcal{P} = \frac{\left|\Psi(R_{\rm o})\right|^2}{\left|\Psi(R_{\rm i})\right|^2} \,,
\end{equation}

\noindent In general we interpret the ratio
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralDefProbability}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \left|\frac{\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}}{\Psi_{\mathcal{B}}}\right|^2 \,,
\end{equation}
as the relative probability of finding the system in the `nucleated' state $\mathcal{N}$ versus the `background' state $\mathcal{B}$, see Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} for more details. Notice that the two states $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ do not always have the meaning of `initial' and `final' states (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction}): the transition can be clearly interpreted as happening in time if there is an initial classical motion of the bubble wall. In such a case, the configuration with a type (a) bubble at its maximum radius (i.e. evaluated at the first turning point $R_{\rm i}$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectivePotential}), plays the role of the background geometry. In the cases in which there is no initial classical motion of the wall the interpretation is less clear. For this reason we will refer to the state $\mathcal{B}$ as the `background' spacetime, instead of initial spacetime. Since we compute a  relative probability, it does not have to be smaller than one, and we avoid the problem of the normalization of wave functionals. Observe that in the context of Euclidean instanton computations \textit{à la} CDL, the relative probability in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralDefProbability} is interpreted as tunnelling rate per unit volume and time, see e.g.~\cite{Weinberg:2012pjx} for details.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) \equiv \Gamma_{\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}} \,.
\end{equation}

In the typical transitions that we will consider in the next Sections, the background configuration is given by some spacetime state $A$, while the nucleated state corresponds to the spacetime $A$ joined to another spacetime $B$ through a wall $\text{W}$. We will denote such a configuration by $A/B\oplus \text{W}$. Then the relative probability for being in the configuration $A/B\oplus \text{W}$ versus being in the background state $A$ is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(A\rightarrow A/B\oplus \text{W}) = \frac{|\Psi(A/B\oplus \text{W})|^{2}}{|\Psi(A)|^{2}} \,. \label{eq:Psi}
\end{equation}

Note that the denominator represents the probability of creating the state $A$ out of `nothing' (`nothing', whose wave function is simply $1$, corresponds to the background spacetime in the `nothing' to $A$ transition). If the state $A$ is a dS bubble, the denominator corresponds to the standard HH or Vilenkin wave function, depending on the choice of the sign in the exponent of the wave function. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} we will argue that both in the case of dS to dS transitions and in the zero mass limit of the Schwarzschild to dS transitions the numerator has a similar interpretation.

If Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralDefProbability} is dominated by one term in the numerator and the denominator (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} for more details), it simplifies to an expression of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ApproxProbability}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) \simeq \text{exp} \bigg[2 \, \text{Re}\left(I_{\rm tot}(\mathcal{N}) - I(\mathcal{B})\right)\bigg] \,,
\end{equation}
where $I_{\rm tot}(\mathcal{N})$ denotes the total action evaluated on the nucleated configuration\footnote{In order to simplify the notation, in the following we will suppress the explicit dependence on $\mathcal{N}$: only over-barred quantities will refer to the background configuration.}, while $I(\mathcal{B}) \equiv \overline{I}$ denotes the total action evaluated on the background configuration. Notice that, if there is an initial classical motion of the wall of the bubble (i.e. if there is a first turning point), the background configuration corresponds to the spacetime evaluated at the first turning point of the wall. Otherwise, the background must be specified on a case by case basis.

\subsubsection*{Computation of the classical action}

We note that the dynamical variables are $R, L, \hat{r}$ and their conjugates $\pi_{R}$, $\pi_{L}$, $\hat{p}$. On a classical trajectory ending at some given values of $R$, $L$, $\hat{r}$ we have in Hamilton-Jacobi theory\footnote{Note that ${\cal L}$ depends on $R'$ since $\pi_{L}$ does, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L}.}
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm tot} = S_{\rm tot} [R, L, \hat{r}] = \int \, dr \, {\cal L}(L, R, R', \hat{r}) \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SVariation}
\delta S_{\rm tot} = \int dr \left(\pi_{L} \, \delta L + \pi_{R} \, \delta R \right) +\hat{p} \, \delta\hat{r}+\frac{\partial{\cal L}}{\partial R'}\, \delta R\bigg|_{\hat{r} - \epsilon}^{\hat{r} + \epsilon} \,.
\end{equation}
 The last (boundary) term needs to be removed from the bulk
action in order to have a well-defined functional derivative with respect to $R$~\cite{Fischler:1990pk}. The integration to get the classical action may be done along
any path ending at the given values. In particular one may choose
the path that keeps $R$, $\hat{r}$ fixed as the integrability conditions
will guarantee that the other functional partial derivatives are satisfied. With this choice we can neglect the second and third terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SVariation} and we can write schematically
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Scl}
I_{\rm tot} = I_{{\rm B}} + I_{{\rm b}} \,,
\end{equation}
where $I_{\rm B}$ is the \textit{bulk} action arising from the integration of the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SVariation}, while $I_{\rm b}$ is the \textit{boundary} action coming from the integration of the last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SVariation}. The two terms can be written in detail as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SclassicalBulk}
I_{{\rm B}} & = \frac{\eta}{G}\int_{0}^{\hat{r}-\epsilon}drR\left[ \sqrt{A_{{\rm I}}L^{2}-R'^{2}}-R'\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'}{L\sqrt{A_{{\rm I}}}}\right)\right] + \int_{\hat{r}+\epsilon}^{\pi}dr \,\left[{\rm I}\rightarrow{\rm O}\right] \,, \\
\label{eq:SclassicalBoundary}
I_{{\rm b}} & = \frac{\eta}{G}\int\delta\hat{R} \, \hat{R}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'}{L\sqrt{\hat{A}}}\right)\bigg|_{\hat{r}-\epsilon}^{\hat{r}+\epsilon} \,,
\end{align}
with the inverse cosine defined be be between $0$ and $\pi$, while $\eta = \pm 1$, as from Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L} and $[\text{I} \rightarrow \text{O}]$ means that the integrand is the same as in the first term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk}, with the subscript I substituted by O. FMP did not evaluate the boundary term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBoundary} since the integral
cannot be done analytically for $M \ne 0$. However the most extreme
form of the puzzle that we encounter comes from the limiting case
$M\rightarrow0$, i.e. dS bubble nucleation from flat space.
In this case there is no inner turning point and it is easy to calculate the boundary integral. 

Since we want to compute the relative probability for the nucleation of the spacetime $\mathcal{N}$, the action $I_{\rm tot}$ must be computed at the (second) turning point. We will denote all quantities evaluated at the turning point(s) by the subscript `tp'. In the cases with two turning points, the subscript tp will denote the difference between the quantity evaluated at the second turning point and the same quantity evaluated at the first turning point, incorporating then the background subtraction, see Sec.~\ref{sec:StodS}.

If Eq.~\eqref{eq:ApproxProbability} holds, the transition probability is given by the real part of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBoundary}. In order to compute the tunnelling probability we need to evaluate the classical action in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBoundary} in each different case as we do in the next Sections.

\subsection{de Sitter to de Sitter transitions}
\label{sec:dSdStransitions}

In this Section we are interested in the relative probability of nucleating a configuration with two dS spaces joined at a wall versus the probability of having a single dS space, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dSdSdSW}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\text{dS} \rightarrow \text{dS}/\text{dS} \oplus \text{W}) = \frac{|\Psi(\text{dS}/\text{dS} \oplus \text{W})|^{2}}{|\Psi(\text{dS})|^{2}} \,.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{dSdSW.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Pictorial representation of the background spacetime $\mathcal{B}$ and the nucleated spacetime $\mathcal{N}$. The letters O and I represent the outer and inner regions respectively, while W represents the wall that separates the two regions.\label{fig:dSdSdSW}}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
It is possible to calculate the general case of dS to dS transitions (with Hubble constants $H_{{\rm O}}$ and $H_{\rm I}$) using
\begin{eqnarray}
A_{{\rm O}} & = & 1-H_{{\rm O}}^{2}R^{2}\,,\qquad A_{{\rm I}}=1-H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}R^{2}\,,\label{eq:AOIHH}\\
V & = & -\frac{1}{4\kappa^{2}}\hat{R}^{2}\left[(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm
I}}^{2})^{2}+2\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm
I}}^{2})+\kappa^{4}\right]\,,\label{eq:VHH}\\
R_{\rm o}^{2} & = & \frac{4\kappa^{2}}{(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm
I}}^{2})^{2}+2\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm
I}}^{2})+\kappa^{4}}\,,\label{eq:RoHH}
\end{eqnarray}
where $R_{\rm o}$ is the turning point (i.e. solution of $V=-1$) There is no initial turning point in this case since the potential $V\propto -R^2$ which has only one turning point (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialdStodS}). So effectively the integration in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ApproxProbability}
starts from $R(0)=0$ analogous to the tunnelling from `nothing' case studied by HH and Vilenkin. The matching conditions are given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat{R}'_{\pm}}{L}=\frac{1}{2\kappa\hat{R}}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}\mp\kappa^{2})\hat{R}^{2}\equiv c_{\pm}\hat{R} \,.\label{eq:R'HH}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{PotentialdSdS.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Effective potential for dS to dS transitions. Notice there is only one turning point.\label{fig:PotentialdStodS}}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure} 

\noindent The boundary action in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBoundary} then becomes\footnote{We have used the definite
integral
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{1+a}}dx \, x\cos^{-1}\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-ax^{2}}}=\frac{\pi}{4a}\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Also note that $\cos^{-1}(-x)=\pi-\cos^{-1}x$.\label{fn:DefInt}}

\begin{align}
I_{{\rm b}}\bigg|_{\rm tp} & = -\frac{\eta}{G}\int_{0}^{R_{\rm o}}\delta\hat{R}\hat{R}\left[
\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'_{+}}{L\sqrt{\hat{A}}_{{\rm
O}}}\right)-\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R'_{-}}{L\sqrt{\hat{A}}_{{\rm
I}}}\right)\right] =  \label{eq:SbHH}\\
 & = -\frac{\eta}{G}\frac{\pi}{4}R_{\rm o}^{2}\left[\frac{\epsilon(R_{+}')}{1+|c_{+}|R_{\rm o}}-\frac{\epsilon(R_{-}')}{1+|c_{-}|R_{\rm o}}+2\left(\theta(-\hat{R}_{+}')-\theta(-\hat{R}_{-}')\right)\right] \,.\label{eq:SbHH2}
\end{align} 
In this case, for instance, the subscript `tp' amounts to evaluating the integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SbHH2} between 0 and $R_{\rm o}$. After some algebra this becomes 
\begin{eqnarray}\notag
I_{{\rm b}}\bigg|_{\rm tp} = \frac{\eta}{G} &&\left[\frac{\pi}{2}R_{\rm o}^{2} \left(\theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{-})-\theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{+})\right)+\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm I}^{2}}\ \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{-})-\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm O}^{2}}\ \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{+}) + \right. \\
&& \,\,\, \left.- \pi \frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2}-H_{\rm I}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{\rm O}^{2}+H_{\rm I}^{2})}{8\kappa H_{\rm O}^{2} H_{\rm I}^{2}} R_{\rm o} \right] \,. 
\label{eq:wall} 
\end{eqnarray}
  
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{newdStodS.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{This plot shows $R(r)$ for both dS configurations and it can be obtained by solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:TurningPoints} on both sides. The red line describes the profile of the vacuum $H_{\rm I}$, nucleated inside the background $H_{\rm O}$. The two are joined at the wall, where $r = \hat r$. We have highlighted the locations of the two horizons $1/H_{\rm O}$ and $1/H_{\rm I}$. This plot is needed in order to determine the relevant contributions to the bulk integrals on either side of the wall. The two vacua are joined in such a way that $R^{\prime}_{\pm} < 0$ at the turning point $R_{\rm o}$, which is needed in order to get a nontrivial contribution from the second term featuring in the bulk integrals in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk}.}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure} 
\vspace{0.2cm}
The bulk action (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk}) for dS to dS transitions gets a contribution from each dS vacuum. It can be most easily obtained using the explicit parametrization for the nucleated spacetime $\mathcal{N}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{I}:& \qquad R = a_{\rm I} \sin r \,, \, \quad L = a_{\rm I} \,, \\
\text{O}:&\qquad R = a_{\rm O}\sin r \,, \quad L = a_{\rm O} \,,
\label{eq:aR}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a_{\rm I,O} = H_{\rm I, O}^{-1}$. The integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} can then be done explicitly and the result is
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm B} = \frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\left[(\theta(-\hat{R}'_{+})-\theta(-\hat{R}'_{-}))\hat{R}_{{\rm o}}^{2}+\theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{-}) H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}+H_{\rm O}^{-2} \left[1 - \theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{+})\right]\right]\,.
\label{eq:SBHH}
\end{equation}
Please note that the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH} cancels the last term within the square brackets in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SbHH2} so adding the bulk and the boundary contributions we get
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot}\bigg|_{\rm tp} = -\frac{\eta \pi}{G} \left[\frac{\left[(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2} (H_{\rm O}^{2} + H_{\rm I}^{2})\right] R_{{\rm o}}}{8 \kappa H_{\rm O}^{2} H_{\rm I}^{2}}-\frac{1}{4} \left(H_{\rm I}^{-2} + H_{\rm O}^{-2}\right)\right] \,.\label{eq:HH}
\end{equation}
It is easy to check that this expression is positive (negative) for $\eta = +1(-1)$ and $H_{I} \neq 0$ and it is symmetric under the interchange ${\rm O}\leftrightarrow {\rm I}$. The above equation corresponds to Eq.~(3.41) in~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp}, except that we set the numbers $N_{A,B}$ to zero, as will be explained in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:Comparison}. Taking the flat space limit in the outer region $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH} we get a non-zero numerator of the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralDefProbability} corresponding to the finite action 

\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot}\bigg|_{\rm tp} = \frac{\eta\pi}{2G}\frac{H_{{\rm I}}^{2}+2\kappa^{2}}{(H_{{\rm I}}^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{2}} \,.\label{eq:0toH}
\end{equation}

Note that since the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH} is symmetric under the interchange  ${\rm I}\leftrightarrow{\rm O}$ the action for down-tunnelling to Minkowski is exactly the same with ${\rm I}\rightarrow{\rm O}$ in the Eq.~\eqref{eq:0toH}. Observe that since the $M\rightarrow 0$ limit of $A=1-2MG/R$ is the same as the $H\rightarrow 0$ limit of $A=1-H^2R^2$ ($A \rightarrow 1$) the Minkowski limit of the black hole to dS action is the same as the dS to dS action where one of the dS's goes to the Minkowski limit. What is different in the two cases is the expression for the background action (which is zero in the black hole case and is the HH or the Vilenkin wave function for the (initial) dS case (see below). 

Recall now that in dS to dS transitions there is no initial classical trajectory. This is exactly like the tunnelling from `nothing' discussion in quantum cosmology in which solutions of the WDW equation are compared at the final (and only) turning point with the solution to be at scale factor zero (i.e. `nothing'). Thus these expressions should be interpreted as giving the probability to find the space of two dS (or dS and Minkowski) spaces mediated by a wall compared to have `nothing'. We will discuss this further in Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away}.

In this case, the latter configuration is the background, whose action, denoted by $\bar I$, is given by 
\begin{equation} 
\overline{I} = \frac{\eta}{G}\int_{0}^{\pi} dr \, \left[R \sqrt{1-H_{\rm O}^{2}R^{2}-R^{\prime}_{+}} - R R^{\prime} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R^{\prime}_{+}}{L \sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2}R^2}}\right)\right] \,.
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} 
\Rightarrow \quad \overline{I} = \frac{\eta \pi}{2G H_{\rm O}^{2}} \,. 
\label{eq:bkgr}  
\end{equation} 
which (for $\eta=+1$) gives the HH wave function (Vilenkin's tunnelling wave function corresponds to $\eta=-1$). Adding Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH} to Eq.~\eqref{eq:wall} and subtracting Eq.~\eqref{eq:bkgr} we get
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot}\bigg|_{\rm tp} - \overline{I} = -\frac{\eta\pi}{G}\left[\frac{\left[(H_{{\rm
O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm
I}}^{2})\right] R_{\rm o}}{8\kappa H_{{\rm O}}^{2}H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{4}\left(H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}-H_{{\rm O}}^{-2}\right) \right] \,,
\label{eq:iStr}
\end{equation}
which is exactly what BT obtained. It is easy to check that the quantity in Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr} is negative (positive) for $\eta = + 1$ ($\eta = - 1$). Observe that, when taking the limit $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$, the relative probability is exponentially suppressed (choosing $\eta = +1$), implying nucleation of a dS vacuum is exponentially suppressed with respect to the nucleation of a Minkowski spacetime. This is in contrast to the limit $H_{\rm O}\rightarrow 0$ of Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH}. Thus this suppression is coming entirely from the blow up of the HH wave function. We will discuss this further in Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} where we will explain how the sign $\eta$ is determined. 

\subsection{Schwarzschild to de Sitter transitions}
\label{sec:StodS}

The case  investigated by FGG/FMP corresponds to s Schwarzschild to dS transition, namely one where
\begin{equation}
A_{{\rm O}} = 1 - \frac{2GM_{{\rm O}}}{R}\,, \qquad A_{{\rm I}}=1-H_{{\rm I}}^{2}R^{2}.
\end{equation}
In this case, Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'pm} becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{R'(\hat{r}\pm\epsilon)}{\hat{L}}=\frac{1}{2\kappa\hat{R}}\left(-\hat{R}^{2}(H^{2}\pm\kappa^{2})+\frac{2GM}{\hat{R}}\right)\,.\label{eq:R'+-}
\end{equation}
The motion of the wall is then given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:E and m} with
\begin{eqnarray}
V & = & -\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}+\kappa^{2})\hat{R}^{2}-\frac{2GM_{{\rm
O}}}{\hat{R}}\right)^{2}-\frac{2GM_{{\rm O}}}{\hat{R}} = \label{eq:VBGG}\\
 & = &
-\frac{1}{(2\kappa\hat{R})^{2}}\left((H_{\rm I}^{2}-\kappa^{2})\hat{R}^{2}-\frac{2GM_{{\rm
O}}}{\hat{R}}\right)^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2}\hat{R}^{2} \,.\label{eq:VBGGalt}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that while $\Lambda_{{\rm O}}$ (and hence $H_{{\rm O}}$) is
a parameter in the Lagrangian (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:Sm}), $M$ is an integration constant (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:pi_L}). Note also that the turning points are defined by $V = - 1$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialSdS}) and are ordered such that (see discussion after Eq.~\eqref{eq:Valt}),
\begin{equation}
R_{\rm S}\equiv 2M_{{\rm O}}G\le\hat{R}_{{\rm i}} < \hat{R}_{{\rm o}} \le R_{\rm D} \equiv H_{{\rm I}}^{-1} \,.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{PotentialSdS.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Effective potential for Schwarzschild to dS transitions. Notice there are two turning points. \label{fig:PotentialSdS}}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
For $R<R_{{\rm i}}$ there is a classical solution where the bubble
emerges from the black hole singularity grows to $R_{{\rm i}}$ and then collapses to the singularity. For $R>R_{{\rm o}}$ the bubble emerges from infinity contracts to $R_{{\rm o}}$ and then expands to infinity\footnote{For more details see~\cite{Blau:1986cw}.}.
Also the character of the turning point changes when the integration
constant is such that the points where $\hat{R}'_{\pm}=0$ coincide
with a turning point, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\hat{R}'_{+} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \hat{R}=R_{\mathcal S}\equiv 2MG \,; \quad V  = -1\quad{\rm
for\quad}M= M_{\rm S}\equiv\frac{1}{2G\sqrt{(H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}+\kappa^{2})\ }}\,,\label{eq:Ms}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{R}'_{-} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \hat{R} = R_{\rm dS}\equiv\frac{1}{H_{{\rm
I}}} \,; \quad V = -1 \quad{\rm for\quad} M =M_{\rm D}\equiv \frac{H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}-\kappa^{2}}{2GH_{{\rm I}}^{3}}\,,
\end{equation}
Note that $M_{\rm D} < M_{\rm S}$. FMP evaluated the difference in the bulk actions using Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} and find the following results for different values of the integration constant\footnote{Note that the sign of $R'$ is determined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'pm} at $r=\hat{r}$ and then preserves this sign for $r\ne\hat{r}$ until $R$ crosses a horizon. It is useful to look at the figures  in~\cite{Blau:1986cw} (particularly Fig. 6) in deriving this. Also $\beta$ defined there is equal to $\hat{R}'$ in FMP notation used here.}
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{{\rm B}}\bigg|_{\rm tp} \equiv I_{{\rm B}}\bigg|_{R_{{\rm i}}}^{R_{\rm o}} =\begin{cases}
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{\rm o}^{2}-R_{{\rm
i}}^{2})\,, \qquad & M > M_{\rm S} \,,\label{eq:SB1}\\
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{\rm o}^{2}-R_{\mathcal S}^{2})\,, \qquad & M_{\rm S} > M > M_{\rm D} \,,\label{eq:SB2}\\
\frac{\eta\pi}{2G}(R_{\rm dS}^{2}-R_{\mathcal S}^{2})\,, \qquad & M_{\rm D} > M \,.\label{eq:SB3}
 \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
In this case, the spacetime configuration at the first turning point represents the background configuration of the transition. FMP did not compute the boundary term since, in contrast to the dS to dS considered before, the integral cannot be done analytically. We will consider in detail the last case in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SB3}, which is the case of interest in order to take the limit $M \rightarrow 0$. As we will show in the next Section, the background action for the black hole (unlike the HH wave function for dS) does not blow up in the Minkowski limit and therefore the transition does not vanish even in this limit. We also note for future reference that the last line in the above equation is simply the difference of (half) the horizon entropies of dS and Schwarzschild.

\subsection{Schwarzschild to de Sitter transitions (and viceversa) in the limit $M \rightarrow 0$}

In the zero mass limit of Schwarzschild to dS transitions (and viceversa) in contrast to the general case the wall integral can be performed analytically. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{Down-tunnelling to Minkowski: de Sitter to Minkowski transitions}}
The total action (before subtracting the background action) is given by our previous expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:0toH} with $H_{\rm I}\rightarrow H$ (see also the discussion below Eq.~\eqref{eq:0toH}). Therefore the total action after background subtraction is:
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot} \bigg|_{\rm tp}-\bar I = - \frac{\eta\pi}{G} \frac{\kappa^{4}}{2H^{2}(H^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{2}}  \,.
\label{eq:13} 
\end{equation} 
This (with $\eta=+1$) is the standard result for CDL as can be also verified by starting with Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr} and taking the limit $H_{\rm I} \rightarrow 0$. Therefore we conclude that both Minkowski limits: the $H_{\rm I} \rightarrow 0$ limit of dS to dS and the $M \rightarrow 0$ of Schwarzschild to dS give the same result for CDL down-tunnelling.

\subsubsection*{\underline{Up-tunnelling from Minkowski: Minkowski to de Sitter transitions}} 

The total action for up-tunnelling from Minkowski is given again by Eq.~\eqref{eq:0toH} with $H_{\rm I} \rightarrow H$. The background action is now the limit of the black hole action when $M\rightarrow 0$: the background action vanishes. Thus for two spaces $A$ and $B$ we denote the relative probability for being in the configuration $A/B\oplus \text{W}$ (i.e. the two  spaces joined by a wall) versus being in the initial state $A$ as $\mathcal{P}(A\rightarrow A/B\oplus \text{W})$. The transition probabilities for up- and down-tunnelling therefore read
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}/{\rm{dS}} \oplus \text{W}) = \exp\left[\frac{\eta \pi}{G H^2} \left(1 -  \frac{\kappa^4}{(H^2 + \kappa^2)^2} \right) \right]  
\label{eq:P1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P} ({\rm{dS}}\rightarrow {\rm{dS}}/\mathcal{M} \oplus \text{W}) = \exp \left[\frac{\eta \pi}{G H^2} \left(- \frac{\kappa^4}{(H^2 + \kappa^2)^2} \right) \right]
\label{eq:P2}
\end{equation}
respectively. The ratio between the two transitions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:P1} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:P2} is thus
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{P} (\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}/\rm{dS} \oplus \text{W})}{\mathcal{P} (\rm{dS} \rightarrow \rm{dS}/\mathcal{M} \oplus \text{W})} = \exp \left[\eta\frac{\pi}{G} \frac{1}{H^2} \right] \,,
\end{equation}
which is the ratio of the exponentials of the entropy of dS to the exponential of the entropy of Minkowski (taken as the $M \rightarrow 0$ limit of a Schwarzschild black hole entropy, i.e. zero), implying that detailed balance is correctly recovered even in the black hole case in the limit $M \rightarrow 0$.

Now depending on the sign $\eta$ we have two different puzzles. Take the brane tension $\kappa$ to be vanishingly small  $\kappa\ll H$ and consider first the case $\eta=+1$. Then Eq.~\eqref{eq:P1} (which is the relative probability for tunnelling from `nothing' to the composite of Minkowski and dS joined at the brane compared to remaining in the Minkowski ground state) goes over to the HH wave function for tunnelling from `nothing' to dS space. Now if we take smaller and smaller values of $H$ we get the well-known divergence of the HH wave function for zero cosmological constant. This appears to mean that it is infinitely more probable to be in a dS space with cosmological constant tending to zero than to be in the vacuum state of Minkowski. Of course this is again a reflection of the fact that the HH wave function is the exponential of the horizon entropy. In some sense this ratio (in the limit) then is the probability of being in a random state of the Hilbert space built on the Minkowski vacuum relative to being in the ground state.

On the other hand with $\eta=-1$ the same ratio gives the probability of being in dS after tunnelling from `nothing' according to Vilenkin compared to the probability of being in the Minkowski vacuum. This ratio, in the limit of the cosmological constant of the dS space going to zero, goes to zero. It is unclear how to interpret this. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Wave-function-away} we will argue that the dominant contribution to these relative probabilities corresponds to choosing $\eta=+1$ i.e. with the HH wave function for dS.

\subsection{Schwarzschild-de Sitter to Schwarzschild-de Sitter transitions}

For completeness let us briefly consider also the most general case of $\mathcal{S}$dS to $\mathcal{S}$dS. Taking two metric functions of the same kind
\begin{equation}
A_{\rm I} = 1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm I}}{R} - H_{\rm I}^2 R^2 \,, \qquad
A_{\rm O} = 1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm O}}{R} - H_{\rm O}^2 R^2 \,,
\end{equation}
at the turning points the bulk action reads 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BulkActionGeneric}
I_{\rm B} \bigg|_{\rm tp} = \frac{\eta \pi}{2G} \left[\theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{-})\left(R_{\rm{I},2}^{2}-R_{\rm o}^2\right) + \theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{+})\left(R_{\rm o}^2 - R_{\rm{O},1}^{2}\right) + R_{\rm{O},2}^{2} - R_{\rm{O},1}^{2}\right] \,,
\end{equation} 
In this setup, the metric function has two positive and one negative roots. The former actually correspond to an event and a cosmological horizon. We will refer to them as $R_{\rm{O},1} < R_{\rm{O},2}$ and $R_{\rm{I},1} < R_{\rm{I},2}$ for the outer and inner vacua, respectively.

The boundary action is given by
\begin{align}
I_{\rm b} = &- \frac{\eta}{G}\int dR R \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2(H_{\rm O}^2 - H_{\rm I}^2 - \kappa^2)}{2 \kappa R \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm O}}{R} - H_{\rm O}^2 R^2}}\right) + \nonumber \\
&+ \frac{\eta}{G}\int dR R \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2 (H_{\rm O}^2 - H_{\rm I}^2 + \kappa^2)}{2 \kappa R \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM_{\rm I}}{R} - H_{\rm I}^2 R^2}}\right) \,.
\end{align}
Since the junction conditions now read
\begin{equation}
\frac{R^{\prime}_{\pm}}{L} = \frac{1}{2 \kappa R}\left(R^2 (H_{\rm O}^2 - H_{\rm I}^2 \mp \kappa^2) + \frac{2G(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I})}{R}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
and the background action is
\begin{equation} 
\overline{I} = \frac{\eta \pi}{2G} \left[R_{\rm{O},2}^{2} - R_{\rm{O},1}^{2}\right] \,.
\end{equation} 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SdStoSdS1.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Still relying upon the same arguments as for the dS to dS case, the plot of $R(r)$ on either side is what enables to determine the nontrivial contributions to the bulk action. Indeed, in absence of any disconnected spacetimes, $R^{\prime}_{\pm} < 0$ only in between $1/H_{\rm I}$ and $2GM_{\rm O}$.}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

\noindent In this case the classical turning points are determined by solving the following system of equations
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm eff}^{\rm out} = -1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad - \frac{1}{(2 \kappa R)^2} \left(\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2 (H_{\rm I}^2 - H_{\rm O}^2) \right)^2 + H_{\rm O}^2 R^2 +\frac{2GM_{\rm O}}{R} = -1 \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm eff}^{\rm in} = -1 \quad  \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{1}{(2 \kappa R)^2} \left(\frac{2G}{R}(M_{\rm O} - M_{\rm I}) + R^2 (H_{\rm I}^2 - H_{\rm O}^2)\right)^2 + H_{\rm I}^2 R^2 +\frac{2GM_{\rm I}}{R} = -1\,. \nonumber
\end{equation}
These are polynomials of degree 8 in $R$, the solutions dependening on the different parameters. In general, the  $\mathcal{S}$dS to $\mathcal{S}$dS transitions are characterised by four parameters, namely $H_{\rm I,O}$ and $M_{\rm I,O}$ and the particular case Minkowski to dS can be extracted by taking $H_{\rm O}, M_{\rm I,O} \rightarrow 0$. According to the particular order with which these three limits are taken, a non-commutative behaviour emerges. Of the six possible cases, four of them allow transitions as in the Schwarzschild to de Sitter case and two do not allow Minkowski to dS transitions as in the dS to dS case. Examples of both cases are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:MIMO} and Fig.~\ref{fig:MIHO}, the dashed black line denotes the location of the wall.

Before taking the $M_{\textrm{O}}\rightarrow 0$ limit, Fig.~\ref{fig:MIMO} corresponds to BGG's sequence for Schwarzschild to dS transitions. In their article, the authors argue that, selecting constant time slices intersecting the black hole event horizon, the corresponding three-geometry is split up into two regions, lying on the left and right hand sides of the maximally-extended Schwarzschild configuration, respectively. The former is joined to the newly nucleated dS by the wall, whereas the latter is the relic vacuum prior to the transition. When ultimately taking the limit of vanishing mass parameter, the right hand side amounts to the Minkowski flat spacetime in the last step of the sequence in Fig.~\ref{fig:MIMO}.

\subsection{Summary of vacuum decays}

\end{center} 
\end{figure}
\noindent Let us summarise our general results regarding transitions between different vacua. We consider for both up-tunnelling and down-tunnelling processes, different ranges for the energy gap between the nucleated and background configurations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:LandscapePotential}. To provide a qualitative idea of the leading-order behaviour of such transition amplitudes, we consider four different values of the cosmological constant $\Lambda = 3 H_i^2 M_p^2$ and $H_i = $ 0, $\epsilon$, $\Delta$, $\Delta + \delta$ with $0 < \epsilon$, $\delta \ll \Delta$. For completeness we add to the discussion an AdS vacuum with vacuum energy $- 3 H_{\rm AdS}^2 M_p^2$. We will use Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr} to compute transitions between dS vacua, Eq.~\eqref{eq:P1} to compute up-tunnelling transitions from Minkowski and the following expressions, obtained by CDL, for the down-tunnelling dS to AdS
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm tot}\bigg|_{\rm tp} = - \frac{\eta \pi}{G} \left[\frac{\left(H_{\rm O}^2 - H_{\rm AdS}^2\right)^2 + \kappa^2 \left(H_{\rm O}^2 + H_{\rm AdS}^2\right)}{8 \kappa H_{\rm O}^2 H_{\rm AdS}^2} \tilde{R}_{\rm o} + \frac{1}{4 H_{\rm O}^2}\right] \,,
\end{equation}
where the turning point in this case is given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}_{\rm o} = \frac{2 \kappa}{\sqrt{\left(\left(H_{\rm AdS}^2 + H_{\rm O}^2 + \kappa^2\right)^2 - 4 H_{\rm AdS}^2 \kappa^2 \right)}} \,.
\end{equation}
We do not consider up-tunnelling AdS to Minkowski/dS since it is prohibited: it can be checked that it is not possible to find a solution for the turning point radius $R_{\rm o}$. The $ij$-th entry in Tab.~\ref{tab:TransitionsSummary} gives $2 \left(I_{\rm tot} - \overline{I}\right)_{ij} = \ln\left(\mathcal{P}_{ij}\right)$, where $\mathcal{P}_{ij}$ refers to $\Lambda_{i}\rightarrow \Lambda_{j}$ transitions. Given the positivity of the action (see e.g. Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:bkgr}), we take $\eta = +1$ in this Section, assuming that the raising solution under the barrier dominates: all the table entries would change sign with the opposite choice, and the preferred transitions would change accordingly. We define $\omega \equiv \epsilon/\kappa$, $\xi = \Delta/H_{\rm AdS}$, $\zeta = \kappa/H_{\rm AdS}$, $\iota = \epsilon/H_{\rm AdS}$ and

\noindent Notice that the functions $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ are non-negative and they all tend to $0$ in the limit $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. From Tab.~\ref{tab:TransitionsSummary} it is possible to read which transitions are preferred:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow \epsilon)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow \Delta)$.\\
Please note that, since $\lambda = \frac{\kappa}{\Delta} = \frac{1}{\omega} \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta}$, then $\lambda \ll 1$ implies $\frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll \omega$. On the other hand, $\lambda \gg 1$ implies that $\omega \ll \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll 1$, i.e. $\omega$ is bound to be small. $\lambda \omega = \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll 1$ is always bound to be small. Then
\begin{align}
\label{eq:0epsilonvs0Delta}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow \epsilon\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow \Delta\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G \kappa^2} \left(\frac{2 + \omega^2}{\left(1 + \omega^2\right)^2} - \frac{\lambda^2 (1 + 2 \lambda^2)}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2}\right)\right] \simeq \nonumber \\
&\simeq \begin{cases}
\frac{\pi}{G \kappa^2} \,\mathcal{O}(1) \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \, \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll \omega \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1) \,, \\
\frac{\pi}{G \kappa^2} \frac{1}{\omega^2} \left(1 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2} \right) \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \, \omega \gg 1 \,, \\
\frac{3 \pi}{G \kappa^2} \frac{1}{\lambda^2}  \left(1 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2} \right) \quad &\lambda \gg 1 \,, \, \omega \ll \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll 1 \,.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Given that $\frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll 1$, the ratio is always positive and the $0 \rightarrow \epsilon$ transition is preferred over the $0 \rightarrow \Delta$ transition.

\item $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow \Delta)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow \Delta + \delta)$.

In this case the comparison is simple
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:0Deltavs0Deltadelta}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow \Delta\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow \Delta + \delta\right)} \simeq \exp\left[g_1 \, \Omega_0^\Delta \, \frac{\delta}{\Delta} \right] \,,
\end{equation}
and given that $g_1 > 0$, the transition $0 \rightarrow \Delta$ is preferred over the transition $0 \rightarrow \Delta + \delta$.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow 0)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow \Delta)$.\\
$\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow 0\right)$ is exact in $\epsilon$, so
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow 0\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow\Delta\right)} & \simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G \epsilon^2} \left(\frac{\omega^2(2 + \omega^2)}{(1 + \omega^2)^2} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2} \frac{1 + 2 \lambda^2}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2}\right)\right] \simeq \nonumber\\
& \simeq \begin{cases} \frac{\pi}{G \epsilon^2} \, \mathcal{O}(1) \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \, \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll \omega \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1) \,, \\
\frac{\pi}{G \epsilon^2} \left(1 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2}\right)  \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \, \omega \gg 1 \,, \\
\frac{9 \pi}{G \kappa^2} \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \quad &\lambda \gg 1 \,, \, \omega \ll \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta} \ll 1 \,.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Hence, down-tunnelling towards a Minkowski vacuum is always preferred.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow \Delta)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow \Delta + \delta)$.\\
In this case the comparison is simple:
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow \Delta\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow \Delta + \delta\right)} & \simeq \exp\left[g_2 \, \left|\Omega_{\epsilon}^{\Delta}\right| \, \frac{\delta \epsilon^2}{\Delta^3}\right] \,,
\end{align}
where we used that $\Omega_{\epsilon}^{\Delta} < 0$. Since $g_2 > 0$ the transition $0 \rightarrow \Delta$ is always preferred over the transition $0 \rightarrow \Delta + \delta$.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\Delta \rightarrow 0)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\Delta \rightarrow \Delta + \delta)$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta \rightarrow 0\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta \rightarrow \Delta + \delta\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G \Delta^2} \left(\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{4 + \lambda^2}} - \frac{\lambda^4}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2} + \frac{\delta}{\Delta} \alpha_1\right)\right] \simeq \nonumber \\
&\simeq \begin{cases} \frac{\pi}{G \Delta^2} \left(\frac{\lambda}{2} + \frac{\delta}{\Delta}\right) \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \\
\frac{3 \pi}{G \kappa^2} \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \left(1 + 2 \frac{\delta}{\Delta}\right) \quad &\lambda \gg 1 \,,
\end{cases}
\label{eq:PD0DDd}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\alpha_1 = \left(\frac{4 \sqrt{4 + \lambda^2} - \lambda \left(6 + \lambda^2 - \lambda \sqrt{4 + \lambda^2}\right)}{\left(4 + \lambda^2\right)^{3/2}}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Hence, from Eq.~\eqref{eq:PD0DDd} we infer that a large down-tunnelling to a Minkowski vacuum is preferred over a small up-tunnelling in both limits.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\Delta \rightarrow \epsilon)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\Delta \rightarrow \Delta + \delta)$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta \rightarrow 0\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta \rightarrow \Delta + \delta\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G \Delta^2} \left(\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{4 + \lambda^2}} - \frac{\lambda^4}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2} + \frac{\delta}{\Delta} \alpha_1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2} \alpha_2\right)\right] \,, \nonumber
\label{eq:PDeDDd}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\alpha_2 = - \frac{3 \lambda^4}{\left(1 + \lambda^2\right)^4} \,. \nonumber
\end{equation}
The term proportional to $\alpha_2$ introduces $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2}\right)$ corrections to the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PD0DDd} so that the qualitative behaviour does not change.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \epsilon)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \Delta)$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \epsilon\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow\Delta\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G \Delta^2} \left(\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{4 + \lambda^2}} - \frac{\lambda^4}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2} + \frac{\delta}{\Delta} \gamma_1 - \frac{\delta^2}{\Delta^2} \gamma_2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{\Delta^2} \gamma_3\right)\right] \simeq \nonumber \\
&\simeq \begin{cases} \frac{\pi}{G \Delta^2} \left(\frac{\lambda}{2} - \frac{\delta}{\Delta}\right) \quad &\lambda \ll 1 \,, \\
- \frac{3 \pi}{G \Delta^2} \frac{\delta^2}{\Delta^2} \quad &\lambda \gg 1 \,,
\end{cases}
\label{eq:PDdDDde}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\gamma_1 = 1 - \frac{\lambda (6 + \lambda^2)}{(4 + \lambda^2)^{3/2}} - \frac{6}{(1 + \lambda^2)^2} + \frac{4}{(1 + \lambda^2)^3} \,, \\
\gamma_2 = \frac{3 \lambda^4 (7 + 4 \lambda^2 + \lambda^4)}{(1 + \lambda^2)^4} \,, \\
\gamma_3 = \frac{3 \lambda^4}{(1 + \lambda^2)^4} \,.
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
From Eq.~\eqref{eq:PDdDDde} we see that in the limit $\lambda \ll 1$ the sign of the ratio depends on the sign of the bracket, while in the limit $\lambda \gg 1$ it is always negative, i.e. the small down-tunnelling $\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \Delta$ is preferred over the large down-tunnelling $\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \epsilon$. The result is qualitatively similar to the case $\mathcal{P}(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow 0)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\Delta + \delta \rightarrow \Delta)$ where the $\epsilon$-dependent correction proportional to $\gamma_3$ would disappear.

\item $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow\epsilon)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(0 \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS})$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow \epsilon\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(0 \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS}\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G} \left(\frac{1}{\kappa^2} \frac{2 + \omega^2}{\left(1 + \omega^2\right)^2} + \frac{1}{2 H_{\rm AdS}^2} \frac{\zeta^4}{\left(1 - \zeta^2\right)^2}\right)\right] \,,
\end{align}
which is always positive: the up-tunnelling transition towards a dS vacuum $0 \rightarrow \epsilon$ is always preferred over the down-tunnelling transition towards an AdS vacuum $0 \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS}$. The comparison between the transitions $0 \rightarrow \Delta (+ \delta)$ and $0 \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS}$ is analogous.

\item $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow 0)$ vs $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS})$.\\
We consider only the case in which $H_{\rm AdS} \simeq \Delta \gg \epsilon$, i.e. $\iota \ll 1$. In this case, if $\omega \ll 1$ then $\iota \ll \zeta$ and $\zeta$ can be either much larger or much smaller than one. However, if $\omega \gg 1$ then $\iota \gg \zeta$ and so $\zeta \ll 1$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow 0\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\epsilon \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS}\right)} &\simeq \exp\left[- \frac{\pi}{G \epsilon^2} \left(\frac{1}{\left(1 + \omega^2\right)^2} - \frac{\left(1 - \iota^2\right)^2 + \zeta^2 \left(1 + \iota^2\right) + \sqrt{\Theta}}{2 \sqrt{\Theta}}\right) \right] = \, \nonumber \\
& = \frac{\pi}{G \epsilon^2} \begin{cases}
2 \omega^2 + \zeta^2 - \frac{3}{2} \iota^2 \,, \qquad &\omega \ll 1 \,, \iota \ll 1 \,, \zeta \ll 1 \,, \\
\frac{1 + \zeta^2 + \sqrt{(1 + \zeta^2)^2 - 4 \zeta^2}}{2 \sqrt{(1 + \zeta^2)^2 - 4 \zeta^2}} - 1\,, \qquad & \omega \ll 1 \,, \iota \ll 1 \,, \zeta \gtrsim 1 \,, \\
1 - \frac{3}{2} \iota^2 \,, \qquad & \omega \gg 1 \,, \zeta \ll \iota \ll 1 \,. \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
The down-tunnelling to AdS $\epsilon \rightarrow H_{\rm AdS}$ can be preferred over the down-tunnelling to Minkowski in the cases $\omega, \iota, \zeta \ll 1$ and $\omega, \iota \ll 1$, $\zeta \gtrsim 1$, depending on the sign of the bracket. The cases of down-tunnelling transitions from a larger initial cosmological constant are analogous.
\end{itemize}



\section{Wave function away from the turning point\label{sec:Wave-function-away}}

Let us consider again the dS to dS transitions. So far we have evaluated the semi-classical wave function only at the turning points. This simplifies the evaluation of the integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} considerably since at the turning point geometry $AL^{2} = R'^{2}$ so that the first term is zero and the second integral is zero or $\pi$. However, one should really study the general solutions of the WDW equation with appropriate boundary conditions. In fact in the familiar quantum mechanics tunnelling problem one has two solutions inside the barrier as well as two in each classically allowed region, and they should be matched at the turning point(s). In order to implement the same procedure for dS to dS transitions we need to parametrise the dS solutions in both regions and discuss the matching between outside and inside the barrier. At the end of the day, however, we will see that effectively the probability of tunnelling is given by the ratio of the dominant terms in the numerator and denominator (unless for some reason the corresponding integration constant(s) are set to zero). 

Away from the turning  points one cannot evaluate the integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} without knowing the functional dependencies $R = R(r)$, $L = L(r)$. As for the boundary integral, it is defined at $r=\hat{r}\pm\epsilon$, but we evaluated it (in the dS $\rightarrow$ dS case) only at the turning point. Away from a turning point to evaluate both the wall and the bulk integrals we need the result 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int^{u} dx x \, \cos^{-1}\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - a x^{2}}} & = & \frac{1}{2} \left[u^{2} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt{1-a u^{2}}}\right) +\right.\\
 & + & \frac{1}{a}\left.\left( \sin^{-1}\frac{u}{\sqrt{1-au^{2}}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}}\sin^{-1}\left(-\sqrt{1+a} u \right) \right)\right] + {\rm const.} \,.
\end{eqnarray*}
At the turning point (i.e. at $u=1/\sqrt{1+a}$) and taking $0$ as the lower limit of integration, this gives the result quoted in footnote~\ref{fn:DefInt}\footnote{In evaluating that integral we substituted $x=|c|\hat{R}$ where $c_{\mp}=\frac{1}{2\kappa}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2}\pm\kappa^{2})$ with appropriate changes for $\hat{R}'<0$ as in footnote~\ref{fn:DefInt}.}.

Let us now work out the result of doing the wall integral away from
the turning point. In the two regions, inside and outside the wall, we parametrise
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{I}:& \qquad R = a_{\rm I} \sin r \,, \, \quad L = a_{\rm I} \,, \\
\text{O}:&\qquad R = a_{\rm O}\sin r \,, \quad L = a_{\rm O} \,.
\label{eq:a0aIR}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The wall is located at $r = \hat{r}_{-}$ and at $r = \hat{r}_{+}$ in the inside and outside coordinate systems respectively. Its proper radius is then 
\begin{equation}
\hat{R} = a_{\rm O} \sin\hat{r}_{+} = a_{\rm I} \sin\hat{r}_{-} \,,\label{eq:Rhata0aI}
\end{equation}
 and the matching conditions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:R'HH} become 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat{R}'_{\pm}}{L} = \cos\hat{r}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2 \kappa}(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} \mp \kappa^{2}) \hat{R} \equiv c_{\pm} \hat{R} \,.\label{eq:Rhatprime}
\end{equation}
We also need the useful relations 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:R0Rhat}
\begin{split}
R_{\rm o}^{-2} & = c_{-}^{2} + H_{\rm I}^{2} = c_{+}^{2} + H_{\rm O}^{2} \,,\\
1 - H_{\rm I,O}^{2} \, a_{\rm I,O}^{2} & = \frac{1 - \hat{R}^{2}/R_{\rm o}^{2}}{1 - c_{-,+}^{2} \hat R^{2}} \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Note that the last relation implies that at the turning point $\hat{R}= R_{\rm o}$ we have $a_{\rm O,I} = H_{\rm O,I}^{-1}$.

As usual, the total classical action can be written as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Scl}, i.e. $I_{\rm tot} = I_{\rm B} + I_{\rm b}$, where each term can be decomposed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:IDecomposition}
I_{\rm B} = I_{\rm B}^- + I_{\rm B}^+ \,, \qquad \text{and} \qquad I_{\rm b} = I_{\rm b}^- - I_{\rm b}^+ \,,
\end{equation}
where the $+/-$ subscripts refer to the outside and inside regions respectively. The general solution to the WDW equation is given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF}, where the two signs of the exponentials correspond to the choice of $\eta$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBoundary}. In this Subsection we consider the solution with $\eta = +1$, which is equivalent to setting $b = 0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF}. We will come back to this choice in Sec.~\ref{sec:SuperpositionWF}.

The boundary integral at arbitrary $\hat{R}$ is (with $c = c_{+}$, $H = H_{\rm O}$ or $c = c_{-}$, $H = H_{\rm I}$)
\begin{align}
I_{\rm b}^{\hat{R}} = \,\,& \frac{1}{G} \,\int^{\hat{R}}d\hat{R}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{c\hat{R}}{(1 - H^{2}\hat{R}^{2})^{1/2}}\right) =\nonumber \\
 = \,\,& \frac{\hat{R}^{2}}{2 G}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{c\hat{R}}{(1 - H^{2}\hat{R}^{2})^{1/2}}\right)+\nonumber \\
 & + \frac{1}{2 G H^{2}}\left[ {\rm \sin}^{-1}\left(\frac{c \hat{R}}{(1 - H^{2}\hat{R}^{2})^{1/2}}\right) - |c| R_{\rm o}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\epsilon(c)\hat{R}}{R_{\rm o}}\right)\right] \,. \label{eq:IhatW}
\end{align}
Note that $I_{\rm b}^{\hat{R}}\bigg|_{\rm tp} = (I_{\rm b}^{-} - I_{\rm b}^{+})\bigg|_{\hat{R} = R_{\rm o}} - (I_{\rm b}^{-} - I_{\rm b}^{+})\bigg|_{\hat{R} = 0}$, i.e. the boundary contribution at the turning point minus its background contribution (the latter is of course zero), is exactly the expression given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SbHH2}.

The bulk contribution is given by the following integrals obtained
by using Eq.~\eqref{eq:a0aIR} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SclassicalBulk}:
\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
I_{\rm B}^{-}(\hat{r}_{-}) & = \frac{1}{G} \, \int_{0}^{\hat{r}_{-}}dr\, a_{\rm I}\sin r \left[\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2}} \, a_{\rm I} \sin r -a_{\rm I} \cos r \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\cos r}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2}a_{\rm I}^{2} \sin^{2} r}} \right) \right] \,, \\
I_{\rm B}^{+}(\hat{r}_{+}) & = \frac{1}{G} \, \int_{\hat{r}_{+}}^{\pi_{-}} dr\, a_{\rm O} \sin r \left[\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2}} \, a_{\rm O} \sin r - a_{\rm O} \cos r \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\cos r}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2} \sin^{2} r}}\right) \right] \,.
\end{align*}
\end{small}
These integrals can be evaluated, giving  
\begin{align}
I_{\rm B}^{-}(\hat{r}_{-}) = \,& \frac{a_{\rm I}^{2}}{2G} \left[\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2}}(\hat{r}_{-} - \sin\hat{r}_{-} \cos\hat{r}_{-}) + \cos^{2}\hat{r}_{-} \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\cos\hat{r}_{-}}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2} \sin^{2}\hat{r}_{-}}}\right)\right]\nonumber - \\
 & -\frac{(1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2})}{2 G H_{\rm I}^{2}}\left[\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\hat{r}_{-}}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2} \sin^{2}\hat{r}_{-}}}\right) - \frac{\pi}{2} \right] -\frac{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} a_{\rm I}^{2}}}{2 G H_{\rm I}^{2}} \hat{r}_{-} \,,\label{eq:IB-}
\end{align}
and 
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
I_{\rm B}^{+}(\hat{r}_{+}) = \, & \frac{a_{\rm O}^{2}}{2G} \left[\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2}}(\pi - \hat{r}_{+} + \sin\hat{r}_{+} \cos\hat{r}_{+}) + \pi -\cos^{2}\hat{r}_{+} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\hat{r}_{+}}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2}\sin^{2}\hat{r}_{+}}}\right)\right] +\nonumber \\
 & +\frac{(1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2})}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}}\left[\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\hat{r}_{+}}{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2}a_{\rm O}^{2} \sin^{2}\hat{r}_{+}}}\right) + \frac{\pi}{2}\right] +\frac{\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2}}}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}}(\hat{r}_{+} - \pi) \,.\label{eq:IB+}
\end{align}
\end{small}



The total action away from the turning point (but still under the barrier) is

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:B1i}
I_{\rm tot} = \, \frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm I}^{2}}\left[1-\epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{-}) \frac{2}{\pi} \left(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} R_{\rm O}^{2}}\right)\right)\left(\frac{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}}{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}(1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2})}\right)^{3/2}\right] - \\  
- \frac{\pi}{4 H_{\rm O}^{2}} \left[1 - \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{+}) \left(2 + \frac{2}{\pi} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\sqrt{1-H_{\rm O}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2}}\right)\right)\left(\frac{R_{\rm o}^{2}-\hat R^{2}}{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}(1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2})}\right)^{3/2} \right] + \\ 
+ \frac{\hat R^{3}}{2 R_{\rm o}} \sqrt{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}}  \left[\frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} + \kappa^{2})}{\sqrt{1 - c_{-}^{2}\hat R^{2}}} - \frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2}-\kappa^{2})}{\sqrt{1 - c_{+}^{2}\hat R^{2}}}\right] - \\
- \left[\frac{H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} + \kappa^{2}}{4 \kappa H_{\rm I}^{2}} - \frac{H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} - \kappa^{2}}{4 \kappa H_{\rm O}^{2}}\right] R_{\rm o} \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\right) \,.
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
\end{small}






The background action is obtained by setting $\hat{r}_{\pm}=0$ in the above expressions (corresponding to having the complete dS space with Hubble parameter $H_{\rm O}$), giving us
\begin{equation}
\overline{I} = -\frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}}\left[(1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2})^{3/2} - 1 \right] \,,\label{eq:HHV}
\end{equation}
which gives the HH (under the barrier) wave function when
substituted into Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} with $b=0$ and gives the Vilenkin version when $b=2ia$.

Let us first check the turning point bulk contribution.
This is easily obtained from Eq.~\eqref{eq:IB-} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:IB+} by putting $a_{\rm I} = H_{\rm I}^{-1}$, $a_{\rm O} = H_{\rm O}^{-1}$ and noting that $\cos\hat{r}_{\pm}/|\cos\hat{r}_{\pm}|=\epsilon(c_{\pm})=\epsilon(\hat{R}'_{\pm})$. We get
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm B}(\hat{r})\bigg|_{{\rm tp}} = \frac{\pi}{2G}R_{\rm o}^{2}(\theta(-R_{+}^{'}) - \theta(-R_{-}^{'})) + \frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm I}^{2}} \theta(-R'_{-}) + \frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}}(1 - \theta(-R'_{+})) \,,
\end{equation}
which is the same as Eq.~\eqref{eq:SBHH}. If we wish to compute the probability relative to that of having the initial dS space then as before we would subtract the background contribution in Eq.~\eqref{eq:bkgr} (that can be read also from Eq.~\eqref{eq:HHV} at $a_{\rm O} = H^{-1}_{\rm O}$) to get 
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm B}(\hat{r})\bigg|_{{\rm tp}} - \overline{I} = \frac{\pi}{2 G}R_{\rm o}^{2}(\theta(-R_{+}^{'}) - \theta(-R_{-}^{'})) + \frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm I}^{2}} \theta(-R'_{-}) - \frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}} \theta(-R'_{+}) \,.
\end{equation}
When added to Eq.~\eqref{eq:SbHH2} (still using $\eta = +1$) this is precisely the same as the amplitude corresponding to the BT/CDL expression, i.e. Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr}. Accordingly the tunnelling probability is computed as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ApproxProbability}.

\subsection{General solution}
\label{sec:SuperpositionWF}

The result obtained in the previous Section however depends on just picking one branch of the wave function in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Psi}, namely the $\eta = +1$ one, by setting $b = 0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Psi}. In fact, it has been argued in~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp} that one should choose one or the other branch depending on the sign of the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr}. However, there are several problems with this. Firstly, let us point out that there could be a problem with working at the turning point itself since the fluctuation determinant may be singular there (as is the case in the corresponding mini-superspace calculation of HH and Vilenkin~\cite{Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp} for the quantum creation of inflating universes from `nothing'). In fact the semi-classical calculation breaks down at the turning point: it is a leading asymptotic expression to the Airy function, valid only far away from the turning point. Secondly, the choice of $b = 0$ or $a = 0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} corresponds to a particular choice of the boundary conditions.  

In particular, in the well-known HH no-boundary proposal for the wave function of the universe it is in fact the rising term which is kept - i.e. the solution given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HHV} - whereas for the `tunnelling' proposal of Vilenkin one has a linear combination of the rising and falling solutions (i.e. $a = 2ib$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF}) so that in the classical regime one only has outgoing (corresponding to an expanding universe) waves.

In order to elucidate this issue it is useful to analytically continue
the solutions $I_{\rm b}$, $I_{\rm B}^{\pm}$ to the `classical' region $\hat{R} > R_{\rm o}$ (so that $a_{\rm I} > H_{\rm I}$, $a_{\rm O} > H_{\rm O}$). We find\footnote{We use the formulae $\sin^{-1}z=-i\ln\left(iz+\sqrt{1-z^{2}}\right),\,\cos^{-1}z=-i\ln\left(z+\sqrt{1-z^{2}}\right)$ to continue the functions to the whole complex plane. We have in particular $\sin^{-1}\left(\pm ix\right)=-i\ln(\mp x+\sqrt{1+x^{2}})$, which is pure imaginary and $\cos^{-1}\left(\pm ix\right)=\frac{\pi}{2}-i\ln(\pm x+\sqrt{1+x^{2}})$ where the second term is pure imaginary. We also have for $|x|>1$, $\sin^{-1}x=\epsilon(x)\frac{\pi}{2}-i\ln\left(x+\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\right)$ where the second term is pure imaginary, and $\cos^{-1}x=\theta(-x)\pi-i\ln\left(|x|-\epsilon(x)\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\right)$ where again the second term is pure imaginary.} for the real part of the action
\begin{align}
\text{Re}\left(I_{\rm tot} (\hat{R}) \right) & = \frac{\pi}{2 G}\left(\frac{\theta(- R'_{-})}{H_{\rm I}^{2}} + \frac{1 - \theta(-R'_{+})}{H_{\rm O}^{2}}\right) + \nonumber \\
 & +\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm I}^{2}} \left(-R_{\rm o}| c_{-}| + 1\right)\epsilon(R'_{-}) - \label{eq:realIRhat} \\
 & -\frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm O}^{2}} \left(-R_{\rm o}| c_{+}| + 1\right)\epsilon(R'_{+}) \nonumber \,.
\end{align}
Here the first line comes from the bulk $(I_{\rm B}^{-} + I_{\rm B}^{+})$ and the last two lines from the boundary $(I_{\rm b}^{-} - I_{\rm b}^{+}$). For future reference let us rewrite this as
\begin{equation}
\text{Re}\left(I(\hat{R})\right) = \frac{\pi}{2G}\left(\frac{1}{2H_{\rm I}^{2}} + \frac{1}{2H_{\rm O}^{2}}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}R_{\rm o}\left(\frac{c_{+}}{H_{\rm O}^{2}} - \frac{c_{-}}{H_{\rm I}^{2}}\right) \,.\label{eq:realIRhat2}
\end{equation}
We note here that this expression is symmetric between the `outside' and `inside', (since this labeling is a matter of convention), as observed before for the turning point expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH}, and in fact the two are the same. 

As expected these are exactly the values of the under the barrier actions at the turning point but now there is an imaginary contribution which gives in the wave function, an oscillatory contribution corresponding to an expanding or contracting geometry depending on the sign of $\eta$. 

However, the usual tunnelling calculation assumes that the coefficient $a$  in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} is zero, but this choice is the opposite of what gives the HH wave function, which as we pointed out before is the rising (as a function of $R$) contribution. So if we are to follow the logic of the arguments for either the HH or Vilenkin wave functions, we should at least {\it ab initio} keep both terms in the wave function.

The above discussion implies that we have for the inside the barrier (hence the subscript `ins') wave function
\begin{equation}
\Psi^{{\rm ins}}_{{\cal N}}(\hat{R}) = a \, e^{I_{{\rm ins}}} + b \, e^{-I_{{\rm ins}}} \,,\label{eq:Psiin}
\end{equation}
 where $I_{{\rm ins}}$ is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:B1i} evaluated at $\hat{R} < R_{\rm o}$ i.e. $a_I<H_I,~a_{\rm O}<H_{\rm O}$. This wave function is to be compared with the wave function for the background $\Psi^{{\rm ins}}_{{\cal B}}$ which is given by the same expression with the action being given now by Eq.~\eqref{eq:HHV}. 

Actually the situation is more complicated than that since as we argued
before one should really evaluate these semi-classical wave functions
away from the turning points, and in any case one should compare the
probabilities for the emergence in the classical region, where one
would have an expanding/contracting universe(s). However in analogy
with the mini-superspace case, where there is an exact solution -
namely the Airy function - one expects that the wave function in the
classsical region to be a linear combination of the under the barrier
wave functions. In other words one would have (we denote the analytically continued action `outside' the barrier by $I_{{\rm out}}$, and analogously for the relative probability $\mathcal{P}_{\rm out}$ and the wave function $\Psi^{\rm out}_{\mathcal{B}/\mathcal{N}}$) 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}^{\rm out}(\hat{R})=(a+ib/2)e^{\left[\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)+ i \text{Im} \left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)\right]} + (a-ib/2) e^{-\left[\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right) + i \text{Im} \left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)\right]} \,,
\end{equation}
with  the same combination for the wave function for the
background\footnote{Recall that  in the quantum mechanics problem the wave function near the turning point can be approximated by the Airy function since the potential locally can be approximated by a linear function.}. Note that in the latter case one has an exact solution
(it is of course the usual HH/Vilenkin construction). 
Then the relative probability is 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Pout}
& \mathcal{P}_{{\rm {\rm out}}}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \frac{|\Psi^{{\rm out}}_{{\cal N}}|^{2}}{|\Psi^{{\rm out}}_{{\cal B}}|^{2}} =  \\
& = \frac{|a+i\frac{b}{2}|^{2} e^{2 \text{Re}\left(I_{\rm out}(\hat{R})\right)} + |a-i\frac{b}{2}|^{2}e^{-2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)}+2\text{Re}\left[(a+i\frac{b}{2})(a^{*}-i\frac{b^{*}}{2})\right]e^{2i\text{Im} \left(I_{\rm out}(\hat{R})\right)}}{|a+i\frac{b}{2}|^{2}e^{2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)} + |a-i\frac{b}{2}|^{2} e^{-2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)} + 2 \text{Re}\left((a+i\frac{b}{2})(a^{*}-i\frac{b^{*}}{2})\right) e^{2i \text{Im} \left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)}} \,.\nonumber
\end{align}
Now we observe that $\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)$ is positive as is easily seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:HH} or Eq.~\eqref{eq:realIRhat2}. Hence the choice of $\eta = 1$ that we operated in the previous Sections is justified: the first term in the numerator dominates and one gets the same result as in the Euclidean argument of BT/CDL and corresponds to a generalization of the HH argument for tunnelling from `nothing'. On the other hand if we insist on an expanding configuration in the classical region (as opposed to a superposition of an expanding and a contracting geometry) one must set $a + ib/2 = 0$. This would then give a result that is different from the Euclidean calculation but would be a generalised version of Vilenkin's tunnelling from `nothing' wave function. 

\subsection{Detailed balance}

Let us now revisit the question of detailed balance. Let us take two
dS spaces $A$ and $B$ with Hubble parameters such that $H_A < H_B$. Then the relative probabilty for being in the configuaration $A/B \oplus \text{W}$ versus being in the initial state $A$ is 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(A \rightarrow A/B \oplus \text{W}) = \frac{|\Psi(A/B \oplus \text{W})|^{2}}{|\Psi(A)|^{2}}\,.\label{eq:PsiABW}
\end{equation}
Here the numerator is given by the numerator of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pout} with $\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}\right)$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:realIRhat2} with $\text{O} = A$ and $\text{I} = B$ i.e. 
\begin{align}
\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right) = \,\, & \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(A/B \oplus \text{W}) \right) = \nonumber \\
= \,\, & \frac{\pi}{2G} \left(\frac{1}{2 H_B^{2}} + \frac{1}{2 H_A^{2}}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}R_{\rm o}\left(\frac{c_{+}}{H_{A}^{2}} - \frac{c_{-}}{H_{B}^{2}}\right)= \text{Re}\left(I(B/A \oplus \text{W})\right) \,,\label{eq:IABW}
\end{align}
where the last equality follows from the symmetry property that we
observed after Eq.~\eqref{eq:realIRhat2}. The denominator is that of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pout} with 
\begin{equation}
\text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(0) \right) = \frac{\pi}{2 G H_{A}^{2}} \,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, interchanging $A$ and $B$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(B \rightarrow B/A \oplus \text{W}) = \frac{|\Psi(B/A \oplus \text{W})|^{2}}{|\Psi(B)|^{2}} =\frac{|\Psi(A/B \oplus \text{W})|^{2}}{|\Psi(B)|^{2}} \,,\label{eq:PsiBAW}
\end{equation}
where the second equality is a consequence of the last relation in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:IABW}. Since the entropy of a dS space with Hubble parameter $H$ is given by $S = \frac{\pi}{G H^{2}}$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{P}(A \rightarrow A/B \oplus \text{W})}{\mathcal{P}(B \rightarrow B/A \oplus \text{W})} = \frac{|\Psi(B)|^{2}}{|\Psi(A)|^{2}} \simeq \frac{e^{S_{B}}}{e^{S_{A}}} \,.\label{eq:SASB}
\end{equation}
Note that the last relation is valid only as long as the coefficient
$a+ib/2$ is not set to zero so that this term dominates the denominator of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pout}. Thus our Hamiltonian argument is in agreement with detailed balance as was the case with the Euclidean
instanton argument of CDL/BT, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr}. It is important
to note though that here the detailed balance agreement is a simple
consequence of the fact that wave function for the configuration $A/B \oplus \text{W}$ cancelled in the ratio on the left hand side of the Eq.~\eqref{eq:SASB}. Thus the ratio of up to down-tunnelling is simply given by the relative probability for being in the state $B$  with large cosmological constant (and hence smaller entropy) to that for being in the state $A$ with smaller cosmological constant and hence larger entropy, and is therefore necessarily smaller than one.

On the other hand if we had used the Vilenkin/tunnelling wave function (i.e. put $a+ib/2=0$), we would not have satisfied detailed balance since the ratio on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SASB} would be replaced by its inverse. However one should not expect detailed balance in that case since one has only an outgoing wave (corresponding to expansion of the universe) which is not an equilibrium situation - while the HH case with essentially a real wave function corresponds to a superposition of expanding and contracting universes - essentially a standing wave.

\subsection{The flat space limit}

Let us now reconsider the flat space limit in particular the up-tunnelling transitions Minkowski to dS space. As we discussed before the probablity of up-tunnelling goes to zero simply because the entropy associated with dS space goes to infinity as $H \rightarrow 0$. On the other hand, the original calculation of FGG/FMP gave a non-zero probability for up-tunnelling to dS when the mass $M$ of the black hole cofiguration went to zero resulting in flat space. This is of course consistent with the interpretation of black hole entropy as being given by the horizon area in Planck units of the so that in the $M\rightarrow 0$ limit we get flat space with zero entropy. In effect we are assigning
two different wave functions to flat space depending on which limit
is being taken. Starting from dS, in the flat limit $H\rightarrow 0$ we had
\begin{equation}
| \Psi_{\rm dS}|^{2}\sim e^{\frac{\pi}{G H^2}} \rightarrow \infty \,,
\end{equation}
whereas starting from the black hole, in the flat space limit $R_{\mathcal{S}} = 2GM \rightarrow 0$ we get 
\begin{equation}
| \Psi_{{\mathcal{S}}}|^{2} \sim e^{\frac{\pi R_{\mathcal{S}}^{2}}{G}} \rightarrow 1 \,.
\end{equation}

\section{Comparison to other approaches}
\label{sec:Comparison}

\subsection{Hamiltonian description and disconnected spacetimes}

 
In the previous Sections we followed the general formalism developed in FMP and  extended their results in several directions\footnote{For an alternative approach see~\cite{Bachlechner:2018pqk, Bachlechner:2018jmq, Bachlechner:2018rht, UnpublishedBachlechner}.}. In~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp} Bachlechner addressed the tunnelling processes by extending the Hamiltonian formalism outlined by FMP by adding disconnected spacetimes. In effect this is tantamount to extending the integration in the two equations after Eq.~\eqref{eq:IhatW} from $0$ to $-N_{\rm I}\pi$ in the first integral and from $\pi$ to $N_{\rm O}\pi$ in the second integral. One can of course do the same with the background integrals as well. 

For the case of dS to dS transitions, the total action generalises Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr} to
\begin{equation} 
\small{I_{\rm tot} = \frac{\eta \pi}{G} \left[-\frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2} -H_{\rm I}^{2})^{2} + \kappa^{2}(H_{\rm O}^{2} + H_{\rm I}^{2})}{8 \kappa H_{\rm O}^2 H_{\rm I}^2} R_{\rm o} + \frac{(N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} - N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{B}}) - \frac{1}{2}}{2 H_{\rm O}^{2}} - \frac{(N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{N}} - N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{B}}) - \frac{1}{2}}{2 H_{\rm I}^{2}}\right]} \,.
\end{equation} 
In the flat spacetime limit $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$ the transition Minkowski to dS is given by\footnote{Observe that there is a minor difference with the corresponding expression found in~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp}. This is due to the way we take background subtraction and the setting of $M_{\rm O}=0$ (implying $R_{\rm{O},1} = 0$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:BulkActionGeneric}) in the $\mathcal{S}$dS to $\mathcal{S}$dS transition, before the evaluation of the bulk integral. However there is no difference on the general point that there are values of the $N_{\rm{O}, f}, N_{\rm{O},i}$ integers for which the amplitudes do not vanish.}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \exp\left[-\frac{\eta \pi}{G}\left(\frac{N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{B}} - N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} +1 }{H_{\rm O}^2} - \frac{N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{B}} - N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{N}} + 1}{H_{\rm I}^2} + \frac{k^4}{H_{\rm I}^2\left(H_{\rm I}^2 + k^2\right)^2}\right)\right] \,,\label{disconnected}
\end{equation}
which gives a finite non-vanishing amplitude as long as $N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{B}} - N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} + 1 = 0$. The simplest case being $N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{B}} = 0, N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} = 1$ (and $N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{B}} = N_{\text{I}, \mathcal{N}} = 0$). In this case we recover exactly the amplitude computed from the zero mass limit of Schwarzschild without introducing any disconnected spaces. Notice that as expected if the number of disconnected components is the same in the initial and final configurations their role is irrelevant.

As FMP observed, the consideration of an arbitrary number of disconnected parts may be problematic. For a fixed background, for instance $N_{\rm O, \mathcal{B}}=N_{\rm I, \mathcal{B}}=0$, the transition amplitude in the $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$ limit goes like:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \exp\left[\frac{\eta\pi}{G H_{\rm O}^2}\left(N_{\rm O, \mathcal{N}}-1\right)\right] \,.
\end{equation}
For $\eta=+1$ this vanishes for $N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}}=0$, gives the black hole finite result for $N_{\text{O},\mathcal{N}} = 1$ and blows-up for $N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} > 1$. Since the total wave function should be a sum of all the sectors (using $N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} = N$ for simplicity of notation):
\begin{equation}
\Psi=\sum_{N} C_N \Psi_N \,,
\end{equation}
it would naturally blow-up unless the coefficients $C_N = 0$ for $N > 1$. More generally, this would be needed for the $\eta = + 1$ case with opposite results for the $\eta = -1$ case. In both cases $N = N_{\text{O}, \mathcal{N}} = 1$ is singled out to give the full answer.
This potential blow-up was considered as a possible instability of HH in FMP. The problem is that there is no way to limit these disconnected sums and including them will simply make the whole formalism ambiguous. Hence we simply set the coefficients of such additional contributions to the wave function to zero as being physically meaningless. We are only interested in wave functions that can be interpreted as transitions mediated by our wall/brane and that means we just keep the connected terms. A better understanding of this situation would be desirable.

\subsection{Euclidean approaches}
Let us now compare our results with the standard Euclidean approach for tunnelling, starting from the original CDL and BT and then with the FGG approach for the Minkowski to dS transition.

\subsubsection*{BT/CDL}

The original treatments on vacuum transitions were done following the standard instanton techniques which are formulated in Euclidean space. Both CDL and BT formalisms are Euclidean. Up-tunnelling dS to dS transitions are forbidden in CDL but not in BT (and also Lee-Weinberg~\cite{Lee:1987qc}) but Minkowski to dS transitions are forbidden in both CDL and BT. Let us investigate the difference. CDL and BT give the following expression for the transition probability: $\mathcal{P} = e^{-|2 I_{\rm BT}|}$, where
\begin{equation}
\small{
I_{{\rm BT}} (\hat{R}) =\frac{\pi}{4G}\left[
\left(\frac{\epsilon(\hat{R}'_{-})}{H_{\rm I}^{2}}\left(1-H_{{\rm
I}}^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{3/2}-H_{{\rm
I}}^{-2}\right)-\left(\frac{\epsilon(\hat{R}'_{+})}{H_{{\rm
O}}^{2}}\left(1-H_{{\rm O}}^{2}\hat{R}^{2}\right)^{3/2}-H_{{\rm {\rm
O}}}^{-2}\right)+\kappa\hat{R}^{3}\right] \,. }\label{eq:BCdL}
\end{equation}
This expression is extremised (so that the probability is maximised)
at $\hat{R} = R_{\rm o}$ with the latter given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:RoHH}. If we substitute this into Eq.~\eqref{eq:BCdL} we get
\begin{equation}
I_{{\rm BT}} (\hat{R} = R_{\rm o}) = \frac{\pi}{2 G} \left[\frac{\left[(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}-H_{{\rm I}}^{2})^{2}+\kappa^{2}(H_{{\rm O}}^{2}+H_{{\rm I}}^{2})\right] R_{{\rm o}}}{4\kappa H_{{\rm O}}^{2}H_{{\rm I}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{{\rm I}}^{-2}-H_{{\rm O}}^{-2}\right)\right] \,, \label{eq:BCdL2}
\end{equation}
which is exactly the same result as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:iStr}, obtained using the Hamiltonian approach for dS to dS transitions. When setting the initial Hubble parameter to zero, the transition probability vanishes. As mentioned in the previous Subsection this result  agrees with the Hamiltonian approach in the absence of spacetimes disconnected to the wall. However, this does not prevent up-transitions: the argument for this is that FMP and FGG, instead, focused on another transition, i.e. Schwarzschild to dS and subsequently they took $M \rightarrow 0$. \footnote{Note that, in this case, the bulk action would have a term like $2 G M \theta(-\hat R^{\prime}_{+}) \rightarrow 0$ in the flat spacetime limit.} The main difference  between the two approaches is that, taking the Minkowski limit in the latter implies the vanishing of the term proportional to the black hole mass parameter; thereby, the total action still remains finite, leading to a nontrivial transition probability.

Notice that away from the turning points our general expression \eqref{eq:B1i} does not coincide with the BT expression \eqref{eq:BCdL}. However both equations are such that they reproduce the same expression \eqref{eq:BCdL2} upon minimisation and evaluation at the turning points. This is the relevant comparison.

An important non-trivial check of the validity of the Schwarzschild to dS calculation for up-tunnelling is that it exactly reproduces the CDL result when applied to down-tunnelling as we explicitly derived in the previous Section. As already discussed, the fact that the two limits $H_{\rm O}$, $M \rightarrow 0$ lead to different results is a consequence of the fact that though both background actions may be interpreted as giving the relevant entropies in the black hole limit we get zero entropy corresponding to the entropy of the vacuum state of Minkowski (interpreted as the log of the dimension of the non-degererate vacuum state) while the $H\rightarrow 0$ limit of dS gives the entropy (i.e. log of the dimension) of the entire HIlbert space that can be built on Minkowski space. We will discuss this further in the next Section.

\subsubsection*{FGG}

The original study of the Minkowski to dS transition was performed in~\cite{Farhi:1989yr} using the Euclidean formalism. A very detailed study was made of the transition probability and it was found that  the corresponding instantons are singular. Concretely the instantons correspond to Euclidean manifolds over degenerate metrics. This has cast doubt on the validity of the transition.

Here we want to emphasise that even though the validity of the use of these degenerate metrics can be questioned, one of the merits of the subsequent work of FMP was to put these results on firmer ground  by using the Hamiltonian approach, in which case there is no need to introduce degenerate metrics.

In summary, the advantages of Hamiltonian over Euclidean are 
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Both results agree but in FMP there is no need to introduce singular geometries;
\item{} Some explicit terms in the action are derived in FMP but introduced by hand in FGG;
\item{} The spacetime trajectory of the wall can be properly described in a causal diagram;
\item{} Unitarity of the process is built-in within the formalism.
\end{itemize}

However FGG, aware of the limitations of the Euclidean approach were able to add the right ingredients to obtain a non-zero amplitude and the fact that their result agrees with the Hamiltonian approach makes their assumptions more robust. We conclude that even though the original Euclidean approach for up-tunnelling from Minkowski spacetime is subject to criticism, the fact that the subsequent Hamiltonian approach gives the same results provide  strong evidence for the validity of this approach.

\subsection{Thermal/Tunnelling Approach} 

A further argument  questioning the validity of up-tunnelling from Minkowski space goes as follows\footnote{We thank Alan Guth for a discussion of this point. See for instance~\cite{GuthSusskind}.}. Starting from dS to dS, two expressions for the amplitude can be estimated in the Minkowski limit of one dS ($H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$). The first expression assumes detailed balance:
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma^{(1)}_{\rm up} = \Gamma_{\rm down} \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G} \left(\frac{1}{H_{\rm I}^{2}} - \frac{1}{H_{\rm O}^{2}}\right)\right] = \Gamma_{\rm CDL} \exp\left(S_{\rm I} - S_{\rm O}\right)\,,
\label{GuthOne}\end{equation} 
where $\Gamma_{\rm up}$ is the transition rate for up tunnelling, $\Gamma_{\rm down}$ is the well known standard CDL amplitude which does not vanish in the limit $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$ and $S_{\rm I}$, $S_{\rm O}$ are the two dS entropies. Of course this relation is the same as our Eq.~\eqref{eq:SASB} with 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Gamma^{(1)}_{\rm{up}}}{\Gamma_{\rm{CDL}}}=\frac{|\Psi({\rm I})|^2}{|\Psi({\rm O})|^2}=e^{S_{\rm I}-S_{\rm O}}.
\end{equation}
The second expression assumes a non-vanishing up-tunnelling amplitude $\Gamma_{\rm tunn}$ and the $H_{\rm O}$ dependence of the total amplitude could come from a thermal amplitude for bubble nucleation given by the Boltzmann factor $e^{-E/T}$, where $T = H_{\rm O}/2\pi$ is the Gibbons-Hawking temperature and $E\propto \kappa$ the bubble energy\footnote{Note that the thermal component is symmetric under the exchange  $H_{\rm I}\leftrightarrow H_{\rm O}$ and could be used in the standard true vacuum bubble case as a thermal factor multiplying $\Gamma_{\rm CDL}$ (for a discussion of thermal effects in vacuum transition see for instance~\cite{Brown:2007sd}).}

\begin{equation} 
\Gamma^{(2)}_{\rm up} \propto \Gamma_{\rm tunn} \exp\left[-\frac{2\pi \mathcal{O}(\kappa)}{H_{\rm O}}\right] \,,
\label{GuthTwo}
\end{equation} 
where $\Gamma_{\rm tunn}$ is the transition rate for up-tunnelling in dS $\rightarrow$ dS. 

These two expressions should really describe the same process. However, when taking the limit $H_{\rm O} \rightarrow 0$, the latter vanishes much more slowly if $\Gamma_{\rm tunn}$ is assumed (as in~\cite{GuthSusskind}) to be slowly varying with $H_{\rm O}$. At this point~\cite{GuthSusskind} suggest two possible solutions to the paradox. Either $\Gamma_{\rm tunn} = 0$, or the process does not carry off any information from the original universe. Indeed, the latter would allow the evolution of the original universe to proceed unitarily with no information loss. Our findings show that in fact the first expression is satisfied but in the second expression $\Gamma_{\rm tunn} \sim e^{-1/H_{\rm O}^2} \rightarrow 0$ so the two expressions vanish at the same rate. Consistent with the first proposed solution and no Minkowski to dS transition.

Let us try to repeat the analysis of~\cite{GuthSusskind} for the Schwarzschild to dS case.

In this case \eqref{GuthOne} is replaced by
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{(1)}_{\rm up} = \Gamma_{\rm CDL}\,  e^{S_{\rm dS} - S_{\mathcal{S}}} \,,\label{guth3}
\end{equation}
with $S_{\rm dS} \sim 1/H^2$ the de Sitter entropy and $S_{\mathcal{S}} =\pi R^2_{\mathcal S}/G= 4\pi GM^2 \rightarrow 0$ the black hole entropy. On the other hand the thermal argument for this gives (using the black hole temperature $T = 1/8\pi G M$),
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma^{(2)}_{\rm up} \sim \Gamma_{\rm tunn}\, e^{-E/T} \sim \Gamma_{\rm tunn}\, e^{-\mathcal{O}(\kappa )8\pi GM}  \,.\label{guth4}
\end{equation}
But now the tunnelling amplitude up to $\mathcal{O}(\kappa M)$ bubble terms is (see last line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SB3} with $\eta=+1$), 
\begin{align}  
\Gamma_{\rm tunn} & \sim \exp\left[\frac{\pi}{G} \left(\frac{1}{H^{2}} -R^2_{\mathcal S} -\frac{\kappa^{4}}{H^{2}(H^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{2}} \right)\right] \,, \nonumber \\ 
\Gamma_{\rm CDL} & \sim \exp\left[-\frac{\pi}{G} \left(\frac{ \kappa^{4}}{H^{2}(H^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{2}}\right)\right] \,.
\label{eq:2e} 
\end{align}
From this follows that the two expressions for $\Gamma_{\rm up}$ \eqref{guth3} and \eqref{guth4} are the same up to terms which vanish like $M\kappa$. We then conclude that there is no contradiction in having a Minkowski to dS transition from this thermal argument. 

\subsection{AdS/CFT}

Using AdS/CFT arguments Freivogel {\it et al.}~\cite{Freivogel:2005qh} concluded that the FGG mechanism was not achievable. The argument goes as follows. As we have seen, classically Farhi and Guven had proven that it is not possible to create an inflating dS universe from non-singular initial conditions, however in FGG/FMP a non-inflationary buildable state could be created classically from non-singular initial conditions and then quantum mechanically tunnel to a dS state\footnote{Buildable and unbuildable solutions have already been defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction}.}. \cite{Freivogel:2005qh} claimed that since the original buildable state comes from a unitary evolution it is a pure state but using AdS/CFT they concluded that any inflating state has to be a mixed state and therefore it could not come from a pure state, similar to the black hole information loss paradox.  

The key point of their argument, as stressed in~\cite{Freivogel:2005qh}, lies in the definition of the mixed boundary state, and on their inevitable emergence whenever dealing with causally-disconnected spacetimes. To see this, explicitly, let us consider, at first, a pure Schwarzschild\\/AdS spacetime, having two boundaries. Placing an observer on the right hand boundary, e.g., is equivalent to tracing over the left hand side of the wedge provided by the black hole event horizon. Therefore, any pure boundary state for the initial CFT would inevitably turn into a mixed state after tracing over one of the two boundaries. 

\begin{figure}[h!]  
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Picture.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{Tracing over the left hand boundary, the boundary state on the observer's side becomes mixed.}} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure} 

Freivogel \emph{et al.} claim that the FGG process is very similar to the aforementioned setup, once having replaced the left hand side of the wedge with a portion of dS spacetime\footnote{Examples of patched up metrics are provided in the introduction.}. At this point, they argue that, the black hole separating the observer from the false vacuum has fewer degrees of freedom with respect to the ones defining the dS. By doing this an entropy puzzle is identified in the sense that the radius of the bubble is smaller than the corresponding dS radius and bigger than the black hole radius, implying that the black hole entropy must necessarily be smaller than the dS entropy (see also~\cite{Banks:2002nm}). The puzzle is how can a pure state coming up from few black hole degrees of freedom give rise to the large number of degrees of freedom needed to define the dS geometry. From this they conclude that the corresponding state living on the AdS boundary must in turn be a mixed one. 

However, we present a solution to this issue, relying upon arguments outlined in~\cite{Marolf:2008tx}. Patched-up metrics, also known as \emph{bag of gold} metrics, are characterised by having a unique boundary, which, for the case of interest, corresponds to the one on the right of the wedge, i.e. where the observer is assumed to be placed. Being there no asymptotic region on the left hand side of the causal diagram, no tracing has to be performed. The dS vacuum is still hidden behind the black hole event horizon, therefore, all the information that can reach the observer on the AdS boundary is provided by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, $S_{\mathcal{S}}$ , which, as also stated in~\cite{Marolf:2008tx}, is not associated  to the counting of all of the degrees of freedom of the black hole, but, rather, just to the ones that are accessible to the external observer. 

Once having clarified this new setup, it is straightforward to claim that the new dS phase can indeed be described by a pure state in the boundary CFT, thereby enabling the tunnelling in between the buildable and unbuildable trajectories. 

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.7, trim = 0cm 1cm 0cm 0cm, clip]{2tr.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{dS/Schwarzschild-AdS and dS/Schwarzschild patched-up metrics, used for the Ryu-Takayanagi and FGG arguments, respectively.} }
\end{center} 
\end{figure}  

Developments after the appearance of~\cite{Freivogel:2005qh} suggest that the inflating geometries may actually correspond to pure states. The new ingredient is the Ryu-Takayanagi~\cite{Ryu:2006bv} definition of entanglement entropy. If we want to compute the entanglement entropy in a region $B$ inside the CFT geometry we construct a surface $\gamma$ of minimal area in the bulk such that the boundary of $\gamma$ coincides with the boundary of $B$ and the entanglement entropy is:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm HEE}=\frac{A_\gamma}{4G}
\end{equation} 
where $A_\gamma$ is the area of the minimal surface $\gamma$.  In the FGG/FMP case the geometry is such that on a confomal Penrose diagram the left boundary corresponds to the point $r=0$ of dS space and the right boundary is one for AdS. Since $r=0$ on the left, the surface $\gamma$ has its boundary on the AdS side and is contractible, i.e. the corresponding entropy vanishes implying a pure state. Therefore this criticism of FGG/FMP does not hold since if the Ryu-Takayanagi argument holds, now we have a transition between two pure states which does not contradict any principle\footnote{We thank Steve Shenker for pointing out this argument.}. 

In this Section we prove that the holographic entanglement entropy associated to a patched up metric obtained by joining dS with Schwarzschild/AdS is vanishing, thereby proving that the corresponding state living on the AdS boundary is pure. 

In the remaining part of this Section, we will provide a brief review of some relevant results obtained in~\cite{Hubeny} and then extend them to the FGG issue. In this paper, the authors evaluate the holographic entanglement entropy for bag of gold metrics obtained by sewing a dS region on the left hand side of a Schwarzschild/AdS metric separated by a wall describing a type-(d) trajectory\footnote{Notice that here we are referring to Freivogel et al.'s classification of wall trajectories.}, i.e. a static configuration enabling both vacua to share the same timelike killing vector field. The main feature of the bag of gold metrics ends up being that $S_{\rm HEE}$ results equal for, both, the domain $A$ living on the AdS boundary and its complement $B$, no matter what is the extension of the domain $A$. However, since their difference should define the entanglement entropy of the whole boundary theory, $\delta S_{A}$, this would also mean that the boundary state associated to an AdS metric has to be pure. Such result would be in contradiction with their setup, since they claim that the process of gluing a dS portion to the Schwarzschild/AdS right hand side of the maximally-extended causal diagram should correspond to having traced over the AdS boundary on the left hand side of the black hole event horizon. Thereby, even prior to having added the dS part, the only boundary left is already in a mixed state\footnote{For a mixed state, $S_{\rho_{\Sigma}}\neq0$ is expected.}.  

The picture reported below, shows how the extremal surface probes deeper and deeper regions with increasing $\theta_{\infty}$. The maximum depth within the bulk is labeled $r_{o}$.  

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{surf1-cropped.pdf} 
\caption{\footnotesize{This picture refers to the two-sided AdS black hole. The outer circle is the AdS boundary, located at $r_{\infty}$.

Dark red lines indicate the disconnected minimal surfaces from the point of view of an observer in $B$. $r_{+}$ indicates the black hole event horizon, providing the (finite) thermal contribution to the holographic entanglement entropy evaluation.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

These surfaces have $\partial A$ whose centre lies at $\theta_{\infty}=0$. The bulk of the given metric, however, is also characterised by a black hole event horizon at $r_{+}$, which is responsible for the folding experiened by the blue lines in the plot. At some point, the blue extremal surface develops a neck which is too thin to ensure this being the minimal surface with boundary at $r_{\infty}$ equal to $\partial A$. Therefore, the need to turn to the complementary description (i.e. that of $B$), which, instead, experiences two disconnected extremal surfaces, one bounded at $r_{\infty}$, while the other is wrapping the black hole event horizon. Notice that the value of $\theta_{\infty}$ at which the two domains exchange is related to $r_{+}$ and also on the dimensionality of the spacetimes being considered. The need for adding the surface wrapping the black hole follows from homology constraints\footnote{The homology constraint takes into account the difference in the topology of the two boundary domains. To understand this, notice that the domain of $B$ is centered at $\theta_{\infty}=\pi$ rather than $\theta_{\infty}=0$, which is what happens for its complement $A$, instead.}. 

On the other hand, we adopt a different perspective, claiming, instead, that the bag of gold metric has a unique boundary, namely the AdS one on the right hand side of the wedge, and therefore it has to be a pure state. From this follows. Furthermore, focusing on the type-(a) trajectory, the patching in between the two metrics occurs on the right hand side of the causal wedge, therefore, there there is no need to add an extremal surface wrapping the black hole, which is only needed when regions $A$ and $B$ lie on different AdS boundaries by the homology constraint. In this case, therefore, the bulk surface $\gamma_{A}$ is such that, for any value of $\theta_{\infty}$ , $S_{A}=S_{B}$. 

In conclusion, holography provides strong arguments in favour of up-tunnelling processes. 


\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this article we have revisited the questions regarding transitions among dS and Minkowski vacua from bubble nucleation. These are important from several points of view, since they can give information about initial conditions for inflation and also for the dynamics and population of the string landscape. We followed the Hamiltonian approach initiated by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski~\cite{Fischler:1989se} and extended their results in several directions. We explicitly computed the transition rates for dS to dS including both down- and up-tunnelling agreeing with earlier results by Coleman and De Luccia~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} and Brown and Teitelboim~\cite{Brown:1988kg}. However, we argue that to properly compute the Minkowski to dS transition with the initial state being the zero energy state of the boundary Hamiltonian, the most appropriate way is to consider the direct calculation of zero mass Schwarzschild to dS instead of taking the limit of zero vacuum energy for the lowest dS vacuum. Fortunately, the calculation can be performed explicitly  and the transition agrees with the original conclusions of Farhi, Guth and Guven~\cite{Farhi:1989yr} and Fischler, Morgan and Pochinski~\cite{Fischler:1989se} in that it is possible to create  false vacuum bubbles starting from flat spacetime. 

Reproducing detailed balance between up- and down-tunnelling is a consistency check of our results. Obtaining the ratio of transitions in terms of the corresponding entropies for the two initial  states brought us to address the issue of entropy associated to Minkowski spacetime from the massless limit of Schwarzschild (which gives a unique vacuum state with zero entropy) as opposed to  the zero cosmological constant limit of dS space (which gives the entropy associated with the entire Hilbert space that can be built on Minkowski space). 


We further  extended all previous treatments of vacuum transitions by explicitly computing the wave function away from the turning points and then we were able to analyse the rates more generally with the wave function exhibiting oscillatory behaviour as linear combinations of independent solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This provides a more accurate picture of the relative probabilities of finding different classical configurations for the universe. Also this discussion shows that (in the case of dS to dS) detailed balance is only recovered (with the identification of dS entropy with the horizon area) if a certain constant is not set to zero to get the Vilenkin wave function (which in general is the sub-dominant term). 
 
More concretely, we can summarise our approach as follows. The vacuum transitions from a background $\mathcal{B}$ to a nucleated state $\mathcal{N}$ are determined in terms of relative probabilities
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ProbConclusion}
\mathcal{P}\left(\mathcal{B}\rightarrow \mathcal{N}\right)=\frac{|\Psi_\mathcal{N}|^2}{|\Psi_\mathcal{B}|^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_{\mathcal{B},\mathcal{N}}$ are solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation $\mathcal{H} \Psi=0$ with themselves being interpreted in terms of the probability to create the corresponding state from `nothing'. In the WKB approximation the wave functions take the general form 
\begin{equation}
\Psi=a e^I + b e^{-I} \,,
\end{equation}
where $I = i S$ evaluated on a classical solution, see Sec.~\ref{sec:TunnellingProbability} for more details. As usual, since the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is essentially a generalisation of the time independent  Schr\"odinger equation, it is not clear how to interpret these transitions as happening in time and we have to be content with the interpretation of transition probabilities as relative probabilities of the different configurations. In fact we are computing ratios of probability densities. Observe that, in Euclidean calculations \textit{à la} CDL, the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ProbConclusion} is usually interpreted as the tunnelling rate per unit volume and unit time of the spacetime $\mathcal{N}$ from a spacetime $\mathcal{B}$. Addressing  dS to dS transitions in this way we can extract the following results:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} $\mathcal{P}$ being a relative probability is not restricted to be smaller than one. Being the ratio of squares of wave functions $\mathcal{P} $ may have well defined interpretations independent of measures as well as any ambiguity in the definition of `nothing'.
\item{} Usually the background is simply the standard wave function of the universe as defined either by Hartle-Hawking~\cite{Hartle:1983ai} or Vilenkin~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Vilenkin:1984wp} criteria. It is then determined in standard minisuperspace techniques. The nucleated wave function, being a composite state has to be computed going beyond minisuperspace approximation, including not only $t$ but also $r$ dependent metrics.
\item{} Boundary conditions determine which term in the expression for $\Psi$ above dominates. For coherent or real boundary conditions (generalising the ones used by Hartle-Hawking for the background wave function), the positive exponential dominates. In this case $\mathcal{P}$ is such that the denominator is the standard Hartle-Hawking probability with the  positive exponential and since the positive exponential in the denominator dominates, the total ratio reproduces the results of CDL and BT for both down and up-tunnelling of dS to dS transitions which are exponentially suppressed. Detailed balance is satisfied as expected since the boundary conditions are those of an equilibrium system with both outgoing and incoming waves. 
\item{} For boundary conditions imposing only outgoing waves in the classical region, corresponding to an expanding universe (generalising the Vilenkin boundary conditions beyond the background) the dominant term in the wave function is the negative exponential ($a=0$). In this case for a dS to dS transition the negative exponential in the denominator dominates and $\mathcal{P}$ is a positive exponential. Detailed balance is not satisfied, as expected given the fact that this is not an equilibrium situation since it  only has outgoing waves. At this moment we do not have a proper physical interpretation of these positive exponentials in terms of transition amplitudes, except for the original relative probabilities interpretation.
 \end{itemize}

On the question of nucleating dS spaces from Minkowski we found the following:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item{} Explicit calculation of the relative probability for being in a nucleated state of dS joined to a Minkowski compared to being in the Minkowski vacuum, obtained from the zero mass limit of Schwarzschild to dS transition (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:P1}), gives:
 \begin{equation}
 \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M}\rightarrow {\rm{dS}}) = \exp\left[\frac{\eta\pi}{G H^2} \left(1 - \frac{\kappa^{4}}{(H^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{2}}\right)\right] \,,
 \label{MdSrate}\end{equation}
 with $\Lambda = 3 H^2 M_p^2$ being the dS cosmological constant and $\eta=\pm 1$. For $\eta=1$ and  $\kappa \ll H$ this is essentially the Hartle-Hawking probability except that now this has the interpretation of being the relative probability of finding a random state in the Hilbert space of dS compared to that of finding the Minkowski vacuum. The fact that this is positive is a reflection of the fact that it is more probable to be in a randomly selected state out of the large number of dS states for a given cosmological constant than to be in the Minkowski vacuum.
 \item{} As a consistency check, the same calculation (describing Minkowski in terms of zero-mass Schwarzschild) is done for the standard down-tunnelling Coleman-De Luccia amplitude, obtaining exactly the same result as Coleman-De Luccia.
  \item{} The rate satisfies detailed balance.
  \begin{equation}
 \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M}\rightarrow {\rm{dS}}) =  \mathcal{P}({{\rm{dS}}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}})\, \exp \left[\frac{\pi}{GH^{2}}\right] =\mathcal{P}({{\rm{dS}}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}})\, \exp\left(S_{\rm dS}\right)
  \end{equation}
  with $S_{\rm dS}$ the dS entropy and the entropy of the Minkowski state (taken to be the zero eigenstate of the boundary Hamiltonian) is identified as zero.
  \item{} Imposing outgoing boundary conditions would lead in this case to an exponentially suppressed transition ($\eta=-1$) contrary to the dS to dS case. Still having a non-equilibrium situation detailed balance is not satisfied in this case.
 \item{} As mentioned above, the same techniques were used to include arbitrary dS to dS transitions and the fact that they reproduce the  known results for both up- and down-tunnelling gives confidence that the Minkowski to dS transition happens.
 \item{} Several standard criticisms against the Minkowski to dS transitions are addressed. In particular consistency with AdS/CFT.
 \end{itemize}

In order to quantify as much as possible, at the end of Sec.~\ref{sec:SummaryHamiltonian} we provided explicit expressions for the different Minkowski and dS transitions with the intention to record which transitions are allowed and which are more probable for a given starting point. The general results depend on the two main boundary conditions giving rise to the $\eta=\pm 1$ in the dominant exponentials but also on the relative sizes of $H_{\rm O}, H_{\rm I}$ and $\kappa$. It is interesting to notice that with Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions up-tunnelling to smaller values of the cosmological constant is preferred starting from both Minkowski and dS despite the fact that the transition amplitudes are positive exponentials in one case and negative in the other. The opposite conclusion happens with the outgoing waves boundary condition. 

We would like to stress that irrespective of the original motivation for creating a universe in the  laboratory, this framework offers an interesting perspective for  early universe cosmology. Nucleating a dS universe in a Minkowski background may be considered as  being similar to the nucleation of universes from `nothing' as proposed originally by Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking. The zero black hole mass limit has only one single turning point and then only one classical region as in the dS case. The transition is then fully quantum mechanical closer to the creation from `nothing'. However, the fact that baby universes are created from white hole configurations seems tantalising. It is possible to have situations with two classical regions and turning points that can actually be considered as tunnelling. The Farhi, Guth, Guven scenario assumes that out of many bubbles created following trajectories (a) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectivePotential}) most of them expand, reach the turning point and return to re-collapse, only  very few of them will tunnel to a trajectory (b) and disappear from the observers in the original black hole geometry. The tunnelling transition towards the inflating universe through the wormhole is fully quantum mechanical. Since the black hole is eternal,  it avoids the Borde, Guth and Vilenkin theorem~\cite{Borde:2001nh} regarding the need for a beginning of the universe but further study on this issue is needed. 

Our results may also be relevant to the study of the string landscape in several directions. First it indicates that dS vacua may be actually considered as a resonance (see for instance~\cite{Freivogel:2004rd, Freivogel:2005vv, Maltz:2016iaw}) that may appear after a transition from Minkowski space and later decay back to lower or higher vacuum energies, including Minkowski again. Second, despite the fact that there is no control on the measure of the landscape, we may have an indication of which transitions are more probable by considering relative probabilities. But in order to properly address landscape issues our approach needs to be extended to extra dimensions including  a proper 10D study of the transitions with different geometries such as the products of 4D Minkowski and dS spacetimes times a compact manifold. Also, a detailed discussion to address the challenges raised in~\cite{Johnson:2008vn} about populating the landscape needs the consideration of multi-field scalar potentials with a hierarchy of barriers and runaway directions. We hope to come back to these and other related questions in the future.

Finally let us reiterate that in this paper we have given a fresh perspective on the decades old discussions arising from applying flat space arguments about tunnelling to transitions amongst space-times {\it à la} Coleman-De Luccia, by formulating these questions in terms of solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, thus eliminating issues about unitarity, purity of states, negative mode issues\footnote{For recent discussions see for instance~\cite{Bramberger, Gregory, Bramberger2} and references therein.}, and degenerate metrics, that plague the Euclidean calculations.

\label{app:PBH}
PBH formation has been subject to many dedicated studies over the past decades and there are several effects which we did not take into account in the analysis of the main text. Here we list some of these effects and estimate their impact on our results, see also Ref.~\cite{Carr:2016drx} for a more detailed overview.

\subsubsection*{Critical collapse}

Primordial scalar fluctuations with a power spectrum $P(\zeta)$ form PBHs upon re-entry into the horizon if  $\zeta > \zeta_c$. A reference scale for  the mass of the resulting black hole is the horizon mass $M_H$ at the time of horizon re-entry $t_N$,
\begin{equation}
M_H(N) 
 \simeq \frac{4 \pi m_p^2}{H_\text{inf}} e^{j N} \simeq 55 \, g \, \left( \frac{10^{-6} \, m_p}{H_\text{inf}}\right) \, e^{j N} \,,
 \label{eq:horizonmass}
\end{equation}
More accurately the mass spectrum of PBHs (at the time of formation) follows a critical scaling relation~\cite{Choptuik:1992jv,Koike:1995jm,Niemeyer:1999ak,Gundlach:1999cu,Gundlach:2002sx},
\begin{equation}
M(\zeta, N) = \kappa M_H(N) (\zeta - \zeta_c)^y \,,
\label{eq:critical}
\end{equation}
for $\zeta > \zeta_c$, where the dimensionless parameters $\kappa$, $\zeta_c$ and $y$ have been studied numerically for the case of spherical, Gaussian perturbations in a radiation dominated background. Following~\cite{Musco:2004ak,Musco:2008hv,Musco:2012au,Niemeyer:1997mt} we will use $\kappa = 3.3$, $\zeta_c = 0.45$ and $y = 0.36$ in the following -- subject to the caveat that these values have been obtained for the spherical collapse of Gaussian fluctuations. Employing Eq.~\eqref{eq:critical} instead of Eq.~\eqref{eq:MH}, the simple one-to-one correlation between a fluctuation sourced at a given e-fold $N$ and a PBH mass $M$ is lost, for any given $N$ there will be a tail of low-mass PBHs as $\zeta$ approaches the critical value $\zeta_c$.

We can determine the fraction of space that collapses to form black holes at a given time (i.e.\ when the fluctuations corresponding to a given $N$ re-enter the horizon) as
\begin{equation}
\beta(N) = \int_{\zeta_c}^\infty  \frac{M(\zeta, N)}{M_H(N)} P_N(\zeta) \textrm{d}\zeta =  \int_{\zeta_c}^\infty  \kappa (\zeta - \zeta_c)^y P_N(\zeta) \textrm{d}\zeta\,.
\label{eq:beta1}
\end{equation}
Here $P_N(\zeta)$ denotes the probability distribution of fluctuations sourced at $N$ e-folds before the end of inflation, which in our case is given by the non-Gaussian distribution~\eqref{eq:Pnongauss}. Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:beta1} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:critical} the fraction of space collapsing at a fixed $t_N$ in a given mass interval $[M, M + \textrm{d}M]$ is given as
\begin{equation}
\tilde \beta(N,M) \, \textrm{d}M = \frac{M}{M_H(N)} P_N(\zeta(M)) \frac{\textrm{d} \zeta(M)}{\textrm{d} M} \textrm{d}M \,,
\end{equation}
with $\zeta(M) = (M/(\kappa M_H))^{1/y} + \zeta_c$. One can easily confirm that $\int_0^\infty \tilde \beta(N,M) \textrm{d}M = \beta(N)$, i.e.\ the function $\tilde \beta(N,M)$ describes the mass distribution of PBHs formed at a given $t_N$, normalized to the total fraction of space collapsing at $t_N$. Note that $\tilde \beta(N,M)$ carries an inverse mass dimension. This function (with a somewhat different normalization) has been referred to as `initial mass function'~\cite{Niemeyer:1997mt,Carr:2016drx}. Finally integrating over $N$ we obtain the total fraction of space collapsing into PBHs in the mass range $[M, M + \textrm{d}M]$ as
\begin{equation}
\beta(M) = \int_0^{N_\text{max}} \tilde \beta(N,M) \, \frac{\textrm{d}M}{\textrm{d}N} \, \textrm{d}N \,,
\label{eq:betaMc1}
\end{equation}
with $\textrm{d}M/\textrm{d}N = j M_H(N)$ and $N_\text{max} < 60$ denotes the largest $N$ which leads to significant PBH production (within the radiation dominated regime).

\label{fig:betas}
%
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:betas} we compare the amount of black holes formed in the horizon mass scenario and taking into account critical collapse, for a toy model with a scalar spectrum $\Delta_s^2(N)$ which features a Gaussian peak around $N = 25$ with a variance of $\Delta N = 2$. We use a non-Gaussian power spectrum as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pnongauss}. In both panels, the dashed blue curve shows the result obtained in the horizon mass collapse setup (as implemented in the main text), whereas the solid black curve denotes the results obtained with the critical collapse formalism reviewed in this appendix. As expected, the differences are larger in the right panel, where we consider the distribution in terms of PBH masses instead of in terms of formation time $t_N$. However, in most of the parameter space the effect is only about an ${\cal O}(1)$-factor in $\beta(M)$, which turns out to be essentially irrelevant compared to the variations in $\Delta_s^2$ (to which $\beta(N)$ is exponentially sensitive) which are induced by different choices of the non-minimal coupling $\varsigma$, the number of gauge fields ${\cal N}$ and the choice of functional form of the non-minimal coupling, $h(\phi)$, see Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}.


\subsubsection*{Non-spherical collapse}

In general, the fluctuations entering the horizon will not be exactly spherical, which can significantly alter the predictions of PBH formation. As detailed in Ref.~\cite{Kuhnel:2016exn}, the shape of the mass function is expected to remain essentially the same, but there can be an overall decrease in the amplitude. We note that in our context this effect is essentially degenerate with the number of gauge fields in the model, i.e.\ we expect that taking into account the ellipticity of the fluctuations might allow us to reproduce the mass distributions discussed in the main text with a smaller number ${\cal N}$ of gauge fields.


\subsubsection*{Mergers and accretion}

So far, we have considered primordial black holes as essentially isolated objects. While this picture is quite appropriate in the radiation dominated regime (where most of the PBH formation takes place), things become more complicated with the onset of the matter dominated regime. Due to the slower expansion rate of the universe, clustering of matter becomes efficient and black holes begin to grow due to the accretion matter and due to mergers with other PBHs. These processes stabilize the PBHs against decay through Hawking radiation (an isolated PBH will have decayed by today if $M_* \lesssim 5 \cdot 10^{14}$~g, whereas the corresponding value at matter radiation equality is $M_*^\text{eq} \simeq 3 \cdot 10^{12}$~g). It has thus been argued~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2017mdw}, that the overall effect of the merging process may be estimated by considering all PBHs with a mass heavier than $M_*^\text{eq}$ as stable and by applying an overall shift $M \rightarrow 10^3 \, M$ to obtain the mass function today from the mass function at matter radiation equality. This moreover implies that the fraction of dark matter consisting of PBHs remains unchanged after the onset of the matter dominated regime.

In our analysis of the model determined by Eq.~\eqref{attractors:inv_definition} (which is the only model giving a significant PBH dark matter contribution), the total amount of PBH dark matter is rather insensitive to these uncertainties, since our mass distributions are only significant for $M \gg M_*$. Furthermore, we note that shifting the mass distribution even by three orders in magnitude in e.g.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2}, will not significantly alter the compatibility of the spectrum with the existing bounds. This is simply due to the scale invariance of the bounds over wide ranges of the parameter space. Note however that this discussion does become relevant when comparing to the mass distribution of PBH observed e.g.\ by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration. Given a peak-like structure in the BH distribution, extracting parameter values in the context of the scenario presented here will require a more careful study of this question.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook \label{sec:conclusions}}


A shift-symmetric coupling between the inflation sector and a (non-abelian) gauge sector opens up new avenues to probe the microphysics of inflation. Based on earlier works studying the coupling of the inflaton field to abelian~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf} and non-abelian~\cite{Adshead:2012kp,Dimastrogiovanni:2012st,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka} gauge groups, we demonstrate here how the former can be understood as a limit of the latter in the far past. To this end, we extend and complement the analysis of CNI (see Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka}) in the following ways: (i) Most importantly, we propose a mechanism for the dynamical generation of the homogeneous isotropic gauge field background, a key ingredient to CNI, starting from standard Bunch--Davies initial conditions in the infinite past. The evolution of the background is then governed by two competing effects: the classical background motion and the stochastic motion due to the strong growth of gauge field perturbations. We demonstrate how the system converges to an attractor solution, where the gauge field background is dominated by the classical motion. (ii) This attractor solution is more general than the solution employed in~\cite{Adshead:2012kp}, and in particular also allows us to study the parameter space in which the backreaction of the gauge fields on the equation of motion of the inflaton is small. (iii) We provide relatively simple explicit expressions for the equations of motion of the Fourier components of all physical perturbations modes, after integrating out all gauge degrees of freedom and constraint equations. Due to a slightly different choice of basis, our expressions are somewhat simpler than those found in the literature, in particular when studying only the gauge field fluctuations. (iv) Although the bulk of our analysis is performed for the linearized system of perturbations, we highlight the importance of non-linear contributions in the scalar sector, giving an estimate for the resulting contribution to the scalar power spectrum. Finally, we emphasize that the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed mechanism for the generation of the gauge field background should be verified in numerical lattice simulations. Research in this direction is ongoing (see e.g.\ Refs.~\cite{Adshead:2015pva,Cuissa:2018oiw} for recent developments) and we hope that this paper will arouse interest in these questions.

In the inherently non-abelian regime of our analysis, we reproduce the phenomenology of CNI: a single tensor (i.e.\ helicity 2) gauge field mode is tachyonically enhanced. A linear coupling of this mode to one helicity of the tensor metric perturbation sources a strongly enhanced, chiral gravitational wave background.  We point out that the instability observed in the scalar sector in Ref.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew} only occurs in a tiny part of the parameter space (achievable only for large gauge couplings when the transition to the non-abelian regime can occur for very low inflaton velocities close to the theoretical threshold value), and is in particular absent for the parameter point studied in this paper. Large contributions to the scalar power spectrum are however sourced by non-linear contributions. We propose a method to  estimate this non-linear contribution based on a generalization of the procedure described in~\cite{Linde:2012bt} and it should be seen as an order-of-magnitude estimate only. Interestingly, we have found that the non-linear corrections are expected to quickly dominate over vacuum and linear contributions inducing a strong enhancement in the scalar power spectrum at small scales. Such an enhancement may lead to a rich phenomenology (e.g.\ PBH formation~\cite{Linde:2012bt, Domcke:2017fix,Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw}, $\mu$-distortions~\cite{Meerburg:2012id}, etc).

The transition between an abelian limit at early times and a non-abelian regime at later times provides a natural way to obtain results in agreement with all CMB constraints while obtaining a phenomenologically very interesting enhanced scalar and tensor power spectra at small scales. The key parameter driving this transition is the instability parameter $\xi$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_xi}), measuring the velocity of the inflaton. In single-field slow-roll inflation models, this parameter is small at early times but increases over the course of inflation. This parameter controls the tachyonic enhancement of the gauge field perturbations, as well as the amplitude of the homogeneous background solution. For the parameter point studied in this paper, the predicted enhancement of the scalar and tensor power spectrum is out of reach of current and upcoming experiments. A comprehensive exploration of the parameter space of these models, in particular regarding the prospects of detecting the gravitational wave signal with LIGO, LISA or the Einstein Telescope, is left for future work.

For the numerical study in this paper, we focused on a parameter point for which the gauge friction on the inflaton motion was small at the point of transition between the abelian and non-abelian regime. We leave a study of the opposite regime, corresponding to the usual so-called magnetic drift regime of CNI to future work. In this case, the dynamics at the transition point change more violently, requiring a more sophisticated modeling of this transition regime. In a similar spirit, the transition region itself deserves more attention. In this paper we simply refrained from making any statements very close to the transition region, to avoid sensitivity to the precise modeling procedure of this transition. Clearly, this calls for further improvement. Finally, the restriction to a linearized system of perturbations in the bulk of our analysis limits our ability to explore parameters for which the transition to the non-abelian regime occurs significantly before the end of inflation. This constraint is already problematic for the parameter point studied here, and likely becomes even more relevant in the parameter space most promising for direct gravitational wave searches, calling for a full non-linear treatment of the system. 

Our analysis is a further step towards the embedding of axion inflation models in a fully realistic particle physics description of the early Universe. In particular, our unified framework for abelian and non-abelian couplings may be applied to more complex gauge groups such as $\mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ and eventually the full Standard Model of Particle Physics.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}



Vacuum decay may  be the cause of both the beginning and end of our universe. It is also  one of the very few  systems in which the quantum aspects of gravity are crucial in order to have a proper description of the physical process. Euclidean methods, developed mostly by Coleman and collaborators~\cite{Coleman:1977py, Callan:1977pt, Coleman:1980aw}, have been used to extend the well understood WKB quantum mechanics techniques  to field theory and gravity. Decay rates have been computed for simple systems, corresponding to scalar field potentials with several minima, mostly in the thin-wall approximation. Related investigations by Brown and Teitelboim involved studying the nucleation of branes interpolating between vacua of different values of the cosmological constant~\cite{Brown:1988kg}. However, while the quantum mechanical calculations are well under  control, the extensions to field theory and gravity rely on  extrapolations such as analytic continuations and approximations, such as dilute instantons, that are not fully justified especially in the presence of gravity (for a review see for instance~\cite{Weinberg:2012pjx} and for a recent comprehensive and critical discussion see~\cite{Andreassen:2016cvx}).

A Hamiltonian approach to vacuum transitions that describes them directly without the need to use Euclidean techniques was developed by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP)~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk}. Solving the Hamiltonian constraints and the Israel matching conditions for the system of two spacetimes with different cosmological constants, together with the bubble  wall (brane) separating them,  allowed them to compute the transitions from a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e. spherically symmetric asymptotically Minkowski) space-time to a de Sitter (dS)  space-time, but the formalism applies to all vacuum transitions considered by Coleman-De Luccia (CDL). The motivation for their calculation was the series of papers by Guth and collaborators on the theme of creating an inflating ‘universe in the lab’ culminating in the FGG work~\cite{Farhi:1989yr}. The latter was based on a Euclidean instanton construction whose validity was somewhat questionable (as pointed out by the authors of the paper themselves). The reason was that this instanton  was singular and the question of whether it should be included in the Euclidean functional integral became an issue. However the  fact that the Hamiltonian calculation of the decay rate agrees with the Euclidean approach, implied (as FMP argued)  that the final results for the transition rates are robust despite the fact that  Euclidean singular instanton calculation was not well defined.

One important difference between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian approaches is the fact that in the Euclidean approach a series of analytic continuations (which go beyond what may be justified by WKB quantum mechanics) are needed in order to find the  Lorentzian geometry after the transition. Even though the starting point may be a closed universe with $SO(4)$ spherical symmetry, the resulting geometry (inside the light cone of an observer at the centre of the nucleated bubble) after the transition turns out to correspond to an open universe with hyperbolic symmetry. However in the Hamiltonian approach of FMP there is no such implication. The entire analysis is done within the context of a spherically symmetric ($SO(3)$) ansatz   but the calculation does not imply the CDL argument for an open universe\footnote{As is well known dS space allows several foliations including those that correspond to closed, open and flat slicings. In CDL the symmetries  of the scalar field determine the preferred slicing after analytic continuation. However the latter cannot be justified by standard WKB arguments and this argument is not meaningful in the Hamiltonian formalism.}. Furthermore the natural Lorentzian mini-superspace calculation corresponding to the CDL Euclidean calculation would have $SO(4)$ symmetry and hence necessarily gives rise to a closed universe as we discuss later. This is an important difference especially if we consider the possibility that our own universe could be the result of a vacuum transition. Actually, based on the CDL result, it has been claimed that this is the only generic prediction of the string landscape~\cite{Freivogel:2005vv, Kleban:2012ph}\footnote{For a different view based on the ``no boundary wave function'', see the extensive work of Hawking, Hartle and Hertog (for example \cite{Hartle:2013oda}  and references therein). In particular in \cite{Hawking:2017wrd} it has been argued based on a dS/CFT conjecture that the probability of observing negative curvature on exit from eternal inflation is exponentially suppressed.
}. 

To the best of our knowledge, the fact that the Hamiltonian formalism developed by FMP can give rise to a closed universe has not been emphasised so far. Probably because the approach of FMP was originally developed in order to address the question of Minkowski black hole to dS transition that was posed  by~\cite{Farhi:1989yr} in the Euclidean approach. However, the FMP formalism applies also to all other potential vacuum transitions (dS to dS, Minkowski to dS as well as transitions involving AdS~\cite{Freivogel:2005qh,Bachlechner:2016mtp, deAlwis:2019dkc,Fu:2019oyc,Mirbabayi:2020grb}). One limitation of this approach is that it only describes transitions among two spacetimes differing by the vacuum energy  separated by a brane, whereas in general the CDL approach is formulated in terms of scalar potentials with different minima and barriers between them. However, in actual practice most such calculations reverted to the thin-wall approximation so that there was no essential difference to having the spaces separated by a brane as in the Brown-Teitelboim~\cite{Brown:1988kg} (BT) calculation. Furthermore the landscape of string theory results from transitions due to the nucleation of branes, which in the EFT approach are of string scale thickness, and hence effectively a thin wall so, as discussed by Bousso and Polchinski~\cite{Bousso:2000xa} for instance, the BT process (and hence FGG/FMP)  is more relevant for the landscape of string theory than the scalar field process of CDL. The latter is more relevant for questions of eternal inflation and other transitions such as the transition towards decompactification, however.

A generalisation of the FMP formalism to include explicit scalar field potentials is still an open question. Here, we are only partially successful in addressing this since we do it only in a mini-superspace model in which the metric and scalar field only depend on time. Nevertheless we find several interesting results essentially extending the `tunneling from nothing' arguments of Hartle-Hawking, Vilenkin and Linde~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp,Linde:1983mx}, and then compare with the Euclidean approach\footnote{Of course in the context of the  ``no boundary wave function'' Hawking and collaborators have long advocated for a landscape of closed universes. See for example~\cite{Hartle:2013oda} and references therein.}. We start by revisiting the extension of the WKB approximation to field theory by solving the functional, time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in the WKB approximation. We reproduce the Euclidean results for the (exponential term in the) decay rates but within a totally different method. The pre-factor however is different and there is no problem with negative modes \footnote{For a recent discussion of the negative modes issues see for instance~\cite{Jinno:2020zzs} and references therein.}. Next we include gravity albeit in a mini-superspace model and then we discuss the extension (for the case of a brane) to an $SO(3)$ symmetric situation following FMP and our earlier work. One of our concrete results is to confirm the fact that in the Hamiltonian approach the end result for the geometry of the remaining universe may be a closed rather than an open universe. We then study the physical implications of this result comparing with previous studies of CDL transitions.

The article is organised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item In Sec.~\ref{sec:WKBandWDW} we develop the formalism to address quantum transitions in Wheeler's superspace adapting the semi-classical WKB approximation in a  covariant superspace approach. Given the nature of the Hamiltonian constraint leading to  the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the corresponding Schr\"odinger wave functional is time independent. The transition probabilities  are ratios of squares of wave functionals for the different configurations. Expanding on standard WKB techniques in quantum mechanics and on previous approaches towards field theory~
\cite{Banks:1973ps, Banks:1974ij, Gervais:1977nv, Bitar:1978vx,  Tanaka:1993ez}, we find general expressions, covariant on a generalised Wheeler superspace, for the leading and next order corrections to the wave functions. In particular, we find a general closed expression for the semi-classical wave functional with the pre-factor given by the analog of the Van Vleck determinant.

\item In Sec.~\ref{sec:FlatSpace} we apply the formalism of Sec.~\ref{sec:WKBandWDW} to the flat space field theoretical case of a scalar field potential neglecting the effects of gravity. In particular, following the textbook quantum mechanics matching conditions we explicitly compute the S-matrix as well as the lifetime of the corresponding resonances and obtain the decay rate.
In contrast to the calculations of Coleman and collaborators~\cite{Coleman:1977py, Callan:1977pt, Coleman:1980aw}, in our calculation we find that there is no issue with negative modes or analytic continuation of a manifestly real amplitude to get an imaginary part to the energy that can be interpreted as a decay width. Instead in our calculation the decay width is identified in the standard way as the imaginary part of a complex pole in the S-matrix.

\item In Sec.~\ref{sec:DecayCurvedSpace} we include gravity but in order to have explicit results we concentrate  on the mini-superspace model in order to compare with the CDL Euclidean approach.  In this case superspace reduces to a two-dimensional space with coordinates the scalar field $\phi(t)$ and the metric scale factor $a(t)$. We find a general expression for the decay rate which in the thin-wall approximation  gives exactly the CDL result but with an unclear interpretation. Furthermore, the fact that the metric in superspace is not positive definite allows for classical paths to connect the two dS minima without the need to pass through the barrier modifying substantially the results for the transition rate as compared with CDL. We argue that both approaches may be addressing different questions.
We emphasise the difference between the two approaches. Even though the calculations in both cases can be said to be done in mini-superspace with an $SO(4)$ symmetry, in CDL, after analytic continuation the standard picture of vacuum transition with a wall separating the two dS spacetimes emerges turning the original $SO(4)$ symmetry into $SO(3,1)$. Whereas in the Lorentzian approach the $SO(4)$ symmetry remains. We also point out the main difference: the fact that CDL implies an open universe whereas we, as with the ‘tunneling from nothing’ scenarios and FMP, find a closed universe.

\item In Sec.~\ref{sec:OpenClosed} we quickly review the relevant points of FMP to extend the results of the previous sections beyond mini-superspace, though with the restriction that the matter sector includes only the two cosmological constants and no scalar field. We describe the trajectory of the wall after nucleation and find it similar to CDL with the curious fact that the speed of the wall reaches a maximum which is less than the speed of light. Then we review the CDL arguments to obtain an open universe and revise the other implications for early universe cosmology as addressed for instance in~\cite{Freivogel:2005vv}: impact on CMB, the number of inflation e-folds,  etc. We then concentrate on the implications of having a closed rather than an open universe after the transition. We point out the physical differences not only regarding the potential for measuring the curvature of the universe, but also on how inflation is obtained after the transition, address the constrains on the number of e-foldings and the effect on density perturbations. 

\item Finally we discuss open questions and give a general outlook in the concluding section.
\end{itemize}

\section{WKB for field theory and quantum gravity}
\label{sec:WKBandWDW}

In this section we develop a general formalism to generalise the WKB formalism for vacuum decay to the Wheeler-DeWitt wave function $\Psi$ in Wheeler's superspace. The Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation is a constraint equation on the space of wave functionals that describe a gravitational system. The ratios of absolute squares of the WDW wave functionals for the different configurations ${\mathcal M}_1$ and ${\mathcal M}_2$ can then be interpreted as relative  probabilities for realising them.

\begin{equation}
{\mathcal P}({\mathcal M}_1\rightarrow {\mathcal M}_2) = \frac{|\Psi({\mathcal M}_2)|^2}{|\Psi({\mathcal M}_1)|^2}
\end{equation}

 The discussion below may be trivially specialised to the case of field theory in which case the (spatial integral of the) WDW equation is essentially the time independent Schr\"odinger equation.

\subsection{Semi-classical expansion  for the WDW equation}

We assume that space-time can be foliated into a family of non-intersecting spacelike three-slices that can be seen (at least locally) as the level surfaces of a scalar function $t$. The function $t$ can be interpreted as a global time function. Given a line element of the generic form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralLineElement}
ds^2 = \left(-N_t^2 + N_i N^i\right) dt^2 + 2 N_i dt dx^i + \gamma_{ij} dx^i dx^j \,,
\end{equation}
where $N_t$, $N_i$ are lapse and shift, while $\gamma_{ij}$ is the spatial three-dimensional metric, the gravitational contribution to the Lagrangian of the system can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralLagrangian}
L_g = \int d^3x \, N_t \sqrt{\gamma} \left(K_{ij} K^{ij} - K^2 + {}^{(3)} R\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $K_{ij} = \frac{1}{2 N_t} \left(\partial_i N_j + \partial_j N_i - \partial_0 \gamma_{ij}\right)$ is the extrinsic curvature, $K = \gamma^{ij} K_{ij}$ and ${}^{(3)} R$ is the intrinsic curvature of the three-dimensional slice. We denote the canonically conjugate momentum to a field $\Phi^M$  by $\pi_M$. The primary constraints of the system arising from Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralLagrangian} are $\pi_{N_{t}}\approx0,\,\pi_{N_{i}}\approx 0$, where $\approx$ means that they are constraints on the classical solutions. In the quantum case we correspondingly have constraints on the space of wave-functionals $\Psi(\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ collectively denotes the three-metric and matter fields (and their spatial derivatives up to second order) present in the system. Note that the classical constraints $\pi_{N_{t}}\approx0,\,\pi_{N_{i}}\approx 0$ imply that the wave function $\Psi$ is independent of $N_{t}$, $N_{r}$. The full system is described by $L_g + L_{\rm mat}$ where $L_{\rm mat}$ is the Lagrangian that described the matter present in the system.\\

The Hamiltonian constraint takes the general form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralHamiltonian}
{\cal H=}\frac{1}{2}G^{MN}(\Phi)\pi_{M}\pi_{N}+f[\Phi]\approx0 \,.
\end{equation}
where $G_{MN}$ is the metric on the $d$-dimensional field space, including all the components of $\gamma_{ij}$ and the matter fields, and can be read from the kinetic terms of $L_g + L_{\rm mat}$. At the same time, the momentum constraint ${\cal P}_{i}\approx 0$ has to hold.  Up to operator ordering ambiguities which are fixed by demanding the derivatives with respect to the components $\Phi^{M}$ of $\Phi$ are covariant with respect to the metric $G_{MN}$ (which we emphasise is not positive definite in the presence of gravity), we have for the WDW equation (replacing $\pi_{M}\rightarrow-i\hbar\nabla_{M}$)

\begin{equation}
{\cal H} \Psi(\Phi) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}G^{MN}(\Phi)\nabla_{M}\nabla_{N}+f[\Phi]\right]\Psi(\Phi) =0 \,.\label{eq:WD}
\end{equation}
As usual we can write
\begin{equation}
\Psi[\Phi]=e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S[\Phi]} \,,\label{eq:Psi}
\end{equation}
and define the semi-classical expansion
\begin{equation}
S[\Phi]=S_{0}[\Phi]+\hbar S_{1}[\Phi]+O(\hbar^{2}).\label{eq:Sexpn}
\end{equation}
Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:Psi} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:Sexpn} in the WDW equation we can in principle determine recursively the semi-classical expansion coefficients. The lowest two orders give
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{2}G^{MN}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{N}}+f[\Phi] & = & 0\label{eq:HJ} \,,\\
2G^{MN}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}\frac{\delta S_{1}}{\delta\Phi^{N}} & = & iG^{MN}\nabla_{M}\nabla_{N}S_{0} \,. \label{eq:prefactoreqn}
\end{eqnarray}
In Hamilton-Jacobi theory, which corresponds to the classical limit of the quantum calculation, $\pi_M=\frac{\partial S}{\partial\Phi^M}$. Observe that at a turning point $\pi_{M}=\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}=0$ for all $M$, and
the semi-classical expansion breaks down since $S_{1}$ cannot be
determined. 

Let us now introduce on the selected spatial slice a set of integral curves, parametrised
by $s$, on the field manifold
\begin{equation}
C(s)\frac{d\Phi^{N}}{ds}=G^{MN}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}.\label{eq:curves}
\end{equation}
Given the constraints, the classical action (on a classical trajectory) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{0}[\Phi_{s}] & = & \int^{\Phi_{s}}\int_{X}\pi_{M}d\Phi^{M}  \label{eq:HJ2}\nonumber \\
 & = & \int^{s}ds'\int_{X}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}\frac{d\Phi^{M}}{ds'}  \nonumber \\
 & = & \int^{s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\int_{X}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{M}}G^{MN}\frac{\delta S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{N}}  \nonumber \\
 & = & -2\int^{s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\int_{X}f[\Phi_{s'}] \,.\label{eq:S0intf}
\end{eqnarray}
We have used Eq.~\eqref{eq:curves} in the third line and Eq.~\eqref{eq:HJ} in the fourth. Similarly from Eq.~\eqref{eq:prefactoreqn} after integrating over the spatial
slice $X$ we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_{1}}{ds}=\int_{X}\frac{d\Phi^{N}}{ds}\frac{\delta S_{1}}{\delta\Phi^{N}}=\frac{i}{2}C^{-1}(s)\int_{X}\nabla^{2}S_{0}\label{eq:dS1}
\end{equation}
giving
\begin{equation}
S_{1}[\Phi_{s}]=\frac{i}{2}\int^{s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\int_{X}\nabla^{2}S_{0}[\Phi_{s'}] \,. \label{eq:S1}
\end{equation}
For a given parametrisation $C(s)$ one can in principle  solve the first order differential equation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:curves} (with $S_0$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0intf} to get $\Phi_{s}$ as a function of $s$ and substituting in Eq.~\eqref{eq:S1} the semi-classical correction $S_{1}$ is determined away from any turning points (caustics). 

One can also choose a parameter $\tau$ to be the distance function along the trajectories, defined as
\begin{equation}
d\tau^{2}\equiv\int_{X}\delta\Phi^{M}G_{MN}\delta\Phi^{N} \,,\label{eq:dtau}
\end{equation}
we get using Eq.~\eqref{eq:curves} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:HJ}
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{d\tau}{ds}\right)^{2}=\int_{X}\frac{\delta\Phi^{M}}{ds}G_{MN}\frac{\delta\Phi^{N}}{ds}=-2C^{-2}(s)\int_{X}f[\Phi] \,.\label{eq:dtauds}
\end{equation}

Solving this for $C(s)$ we have from Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0intf} for the classical action $S_{0}$ (with an arbitrary parametrisation of the integration trajectory) 

\begin{equation}
S_{0}[\Phi_{s}]-S_{0}[\Phi_{0}]=\int_{0}^{s}ds'\left[\int_{X}\frac{d\Phi_{s'}^{M}}{ds'}G_{MN}\frac{d\Phi_{s'}^{N}}{ds'}\right]^{1/2}\left[\int_{X}(-2f[\Phi_{s'}]\right]^{1/2} \,.
\end{equation}

The classical path along which this has to be evaluated is of course
the one which extremises this action with the end points fixed. The
variational derivative may be worked out easily by observing that the variation of the first factor gives the left hand side of the geodesic equation on superspace. Introducing the metric compatible connection on superspace (Vilkovsky connection) $D/D\tau=\frac{d\Phi^{M}}{d\tau}\nabla_{M}$ we get
\begin{equation}
G_{PN} \, \Sigma[\Phi_{\tau}]\frac{D}{D\tau} \left(\Sigma[\Phi_{\tau}]\frac{d\Phi_{\tau}^{N}}{d\tau} \right)+\frac{\delta f[\Phi_{\tau}]}{\delta\Phi^{P}}=0 \,,
\end{equation}
where after doing the variation we have set $s=\tau$ and defined $\Sigma[\Phi_{\tau}]\equiv\sqrt{-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{\tau}]}$. 
 Or defining the affine parameter $\sigma$ by $d\sigma=d\tau/\Sigma[\Phi_{\tau}]$ (note that this corresponds to $s$ if we choose $C(s)=1$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dtauds}) we
have the classical equations of motion (that would follow also directly from the Hamiltonian in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralHamiltonian})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralEOM}
\frac{D}{D\sigma}\frac{d\Phi_{\sigma}^{N}}{d\sigma}+G^{NP}\frac{\delta f[\Phi_{\sigma}]}{\delta\Phi^{P}}=0 \,.
\end{equation}
We remark in passing that this equation of motion does not have an obvious interpretation as Lorentzian or Euclidean since in the presence of gravity (as we stressed before) the superspace metric $G_{MN}$ is not positive definite. We will see the consequences of this explicitly when we discuss the mini-superspace example.
Now going back to Eq.~\eqref{eq:dtauds} and putting $s=\tau$,
\begin{equation}
C^{2}(\tau)=-2\int_{X}f[\Phi].\label{eq:ctau}
\end{equation}
Hence in terms of $\tau$ we have 
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
\quad S_{0}[\Phi_{\tau}] &=\int^{\tau}d\tau'\sqrt{-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{\tau'}]} \,.\quad \nonumber \\ 
\quad S_{1}[\Phi_{\tau}] & =\frac{i}{2}\int^{\tau}d\tau'\frac{1}{\sqrt{-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{\tau'}]}}\int_{X}\nabla^{2}S_{0}[\Phi_{\tau'}] \,,\quad\label{eq:S1tau}
\end{empheq}

\subsection{Wave Function and van Vleck Determinant}
\label{sec:VanVleckDeterminant}

In the corresponding multi-dimensional quantum mechanical case the expression for $S_{1}$ is given by the VanVleck determinant~\cite{VanVleck:1928zz} (see also~\cite{Brown:1971zzc}). To see the connection
we first observe (essentially generalising an argument in~\cite{Tanaka:1993ez})
the following. Changing to the coordinates defined with respect to the orthonormal basis we have for a variation around a trajectory
\begin{equation}
\delta\Phi^{M}(x)=\delta\tau t^{M}(x)+\delta\lambda^{\bar{P}}\frac{\partial\Phi^{M}}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{P}}} \,,\label{eq:deltaPhi}
\end{equation}
where $t^M=\partial \Phi^M/\partial \tau$, while 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OrthogonalVects}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{P}}} = \int_{X} \frac{\partial\Phi^{M}}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{P}}}\frac{\partial}{\partial \Phi^{M}} \,.
\end{equation}
The vectors defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:OrthogonalVects} are orthogonal to the vector $\partial/\partial\tau=\int_{X}\left(\partial\Phi^{M}/\partial\tau\right)\partial/\partial \Phi^{M}$.

Let us denote the components in the original coordinates (including
the spatial position $x$ which is to be treated as an index as $A=\{M,x\}$. In other words it is convenient to use DeWitt's condensed notation treating the set of fields (including metric components) $\{\Phi^{M}\}$ as a set of ``coordinates'' i.e. $q^{i}\rightarrow\Phi^{Mx}$ where the spatial variable $x$  is treated as an index with the understanding that sums over $x$ are integrals and Kronecker deltas are replaced by Dirac delta functions. The superspace metric in the new coordinate system $(\bar{A}=\tau,\lambda^{\bar{P}})$ is 
\begin{equation}
\bar{G}_{\bar{A}\bar{B}}=\frac{\partial\Phi^{A}}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{A}}}G_{AB}\frac{\partial\Phi^{B}}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{B}}} \,,\label{eq:metricnew}
\end{equation}
therefore
\begin{eqnarray}
G^{AB}\nabla_{A}\nabla_{B}S_{0} & = & G^{\bar{A}\bar{B}}\nabla_{\bar{A}}\nabla_{\bar{B}}S_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{G}}}\partial_{\bar{A}}\left(\sqrt{\bar{G}}G^{\bar{A}\bar{B}}\partial_{\bar{B}}S_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{G}}}\partial_{\bar{A}}\left(\frac{\partial\lambda^{\bar{A}}}{\partial\Phi^{A}}\sqrt{\bar{G}}G^{AB}\partial_{B}S_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{G}}}\partial_{\bar{A}}\left(\frac{\partial\lambda^{\bar{A}}}{\partial\Phi^{A}}\sqrt{\bar{G}}C(\tau)\frac{\partial\Phi^{A}}{\partial\tau}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{G}}}\partial_{\bar{A}}\left(\sqrt{\bar{G}}C(\tau)\frac{\partial\lambda^{\bar{A}}}{\partial\tau}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{G}}}\partial_{\tau}\left(\sqrt{\bar{G}}C(\tau)\right)\,. \label{eq:Laplacian}
\end{eqnarray}
In the second line we used Eq.~\eqref{eq:curves}. From Eq.~\eqref{eq:dS1} we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_{1}}{d\tau}=\frac{i}{2}\partial_{\tau}\ln\left(C(\tau)\sqrt{\bar{G}}\right)=\frac{i}{2}\partial_{\tau}\ln\left(C(\tau)\det\frac{\partial\Phi^{A}}{\partial\lambda^{\bar{A}}}\sqrt{G}\right) \,.\label{eq:dS1-2}
\end{equation}
Noting that the line element on superspace may be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=\bar{G}{}_{\bar{A}\bar{B}}d\lambda^{\bar{A}}d\lambda^{\bar{B}}=d\tau^{2}+G_{AB}\frac{d\Phi^{A}}{d\lambda^{\bar{N}}}\frac{d\Phi^{B}}{d\lambda^{\bar{M}}}d\lambda^{\bar{N}}d\lambda^{\bar{M}} \,,\label{eq:lineelement}
\end{equation}
we have (using also Eq.~\eqref{eq:ctau}) 
\begin{equation}
S_{1}[\Phi_{\tau}]=\frac{i}{2}\ln\sqrt{-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{\tau}]}+\frac{i}{2}\ln\sqrt{\left(\det G_{AB}\frac{d\Phi^{A}}{d\lambda^{\bar{N}}}\frac{d\Phi^{B}}{d\lambda^{\bar{M}}}\right)_{\tau}}+{\rm constant}.\label{eq:S1-2}
\end{equation}
Thus the integral in the second term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:S1tau} for $S_1$ is in fact the log of the determinant of the superspace metric in the orthogonal directions to the trajectory defined by $\partial/\partial\tau$. Thus the semi-classical wave function may be written as 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad \Psi[\Phi_{\tau}]=\frac{\left[-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{0}]\right]^{1/4}}{\left[-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{\tau}]\right]^{1/4}}\frac{\left(\det G_{AB}\frac{d\Phi^{A}}{d\lambda^{\bar{N}}}\frac{d\Phi^{B}}{d\lambda^{\bar{M}}}\right)_{0}^{1/4}}{\left(\det G_{AB}\frac{d\Phi^{A}}{d\lambda^{\bar{N}}}\frac{d\Phi^{B}}{d\lambda^{\bar{M}}}\right)_{\tau}^{1/4}}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\left(S_{0}\left[\Phi_{\tau}\right]-S_{0}[\Phi_{0}]\right)}\Psi[\Phi_{0}] \,,\quad}\label{eq:Psi1}
\end{equation}
 with $S_{0}$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:S1tau}. This formula generalises one obtained for many particle Quantum Mechanics and canonical QFT in~\cite{Banks:1973ps,Banks:1974ij, Gervais:1977nv, Tanaka:1993ez}.

Alternatively we can rewrite the expression for this in terms of the
(generalisation of) the VanVleck determinant. To see this we go back to Eq.~\eqref{eq:dS1} and choose the parameter $s$ such that $C(s)=1$. Then the calculation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Laplacian} shows that 
\begin{equation}
S_{1}[\Phi_{s}]-S_{1}\left[\Phi_{0}\right]=\frac{i}{2}\ln\left(\det\frac{\delta\Phi^{A}}{\delta\lambda^{\bar{A}}}\sqrt{G}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Assuming that the complete integral of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation depends on a set of parameters $\alpha_{\bar{A}}$, we can identify the conjugate variables with our parameters $\lambda^{\bar{A}}$ , i.e.
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{\bar{A}}=\frac{\delta S_{0}[\Phi_{s};\alpha]}{\delta\alpha^{\bar{A}}} \,.\label{eq:lambdaconj}
\end{equation}
The VanVleck matrix can then be written as 
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{\delta^{2}S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{A}\delta\alpha^{\bar{A}}}\right]=\left[\frac{\delta\lambda^{\bar{A}}}{\delta\Phi^{A}}\right]=\left[\frac{\delta\Phi^{A}}{\delta\lambda^{\bar{A}}}.\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
Therefore

\begin{equation}
S_{1}[\Phi_{s}]=-\frac{i}{2}\ln\left(\det\left[\frac{\delta^{2}S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{A}\delta\alpha^{\bar{A}}}\right]\sqrt{G}\right)_{s}+{\rm constant} \,.\label{eq:S1-S0}
\end{equation}
Finally, the wave function with semi-classical corrections take the form
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
& \nonumber \\ 
\qquad \Psi[\Phi_{s}] &= \frac{1}{P_{0}}\sqrt[4]{G_{s}}\det\left[\frac{\delta^{2}S_{0}}{\delta\Phi^{A}\delta\alpha^{\bar{A}}}\right]_{s}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S_{0}\left[\Phi s\right]}\Psi[\Phi_{0}] \,,\,
\qquad \nonumber \\
\qquad S_{0}[\Phi_{s}] & =  \int_{o}^{s}ds'\sqrt{-2\int_{X}f[\Phi_{s'}]ds'}+{\rm constant} \,,\qquad
\\ \nonumber
\label{eq:Psi2}
\end{empheq}
with the constant $1/P_{0}$ fixed such that the left hand side at $s=0$ agrees with the right hand side at $s=0$.

A formula similar to this in the context of canonical field theory has been given by Bitar and Chang~\cite{Bitar:1978vx}. However the pre-factor was obtained there, not by  following the WKB method for getting it, but by switching to a functional integral over the fluctuations around the classical path. This gives them a pre-factor which is the inverse of the VanVleck pre-factor above. Furthermore these authors (in contrast to those of~\cite{Gervais:1977nv, Tanaka:1993ez}) claim agreement with the pre-factor in the Euclidean instanton analyis of Coleman et al.~\cite{Coleman:1977py, Callan:1977pt, Coleman:1980aw}. However we fail to see this. For instance the latter depended on the dilute gas approximation and relied crucially on the presence of a single negative mode in the fluctuations around it. Clearly in the above formula the issue of negative modes do not play a special role. In the next two sections we will  elaborate on these differences.

\section{WKB in flat space}
\label{sec:FlatSpace}

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{PotentialFlatSpace.pdf}
\caption{Potential.\label{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

In this section we will recall how to use WKB for the study of vacuum decay in field theory, in flat space. We will analyse two different situations, corresponding to the two potentials in Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}. The left panel corresponds to the process of vacuum decay from a false vacuum to a true vacuum characterised by a lower energy density. In this context, we will show explicitly how the leading order final result corresponds to the CDL bounce, and how the analytic continuation is well justified by the fact that there is an under the barrier integral, which is equivalent to analytically continuing time to an imaginary variable. In this case, the WKB formalism can be used to compute the transmission coefficient $T^2 = \frac{|\psi(\phi_B)|^2}{|\psi(\phi_A)|^2}$, that gives a measure of the decay rate. In the case corresponding to the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace} we are able to be more precise; as the potential asymptotically goes to zero, we can define the S-matrix for such a system and we will show how to compute the decay rate exactly from the interpretation of a resonance as a complex pole of the S-matrix.\\

Consider the potential in Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}. We need to solve the flat space version of Eq.~\eqref{eq:WD}. Now we have a global constraint - classically it is a constraint on the Hamiltonian (rather than the density), 
\begin{equation}
H=\int_{X}\left[\frac{\pi_{\phi}^{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{x}^{2}\phi+V(\phi)\right]=E \,,\label{eq:Hphi}
\end{equation}
 and hence the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
\int_{X}\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}\frac{\delta^{2}}{\delta\phi(x)^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{x}^{2}\phi+V(\phi)\right]\Psi[\phi]=E\Psi[\phi].
\end{equation}
Using $G^{\phi\phi}=1$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HJ} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:prefactoreqn}
\begin{equation}
\int_{X}f[\phi]=\int_{X}\left[\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{x}^{2}\phi+V(\phi)\right]-E\equiv U[\phi]-E,\label{eq:Uphi}
\end{equation}
so Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0intf} becomes 
\begin{equation}
S_{0}\left[\phi\right]=-2\int^{s}ds'C^{-1}(s)\left[U[\phi_{s'}]-E\right] \,.
\end{equation}

Note that in order to make these expressions well-defined we choose the field configuration $\phi$ such that at large $|{\bf x}|$ it goes asymptotically to $\phi_{IV}$ rapidly enough to make all the integrals above finite. Alternatively as we will do in the next section, we can work in a compact space such as a three-sphere.

At this point we can write, in general
\begin{align}
k & =\sqrt{2\left[E-U[\phi(\tau)]\right]}\,,\qquad {\rm for}\,E>U\left(\phi(\tau)\right) \,,\label{eq:ktau}\\
\kappa & =\sqrt{2\left[U[\phi(\tau)]-E\right]}\,,\qquad {\rm for}\,E<U(\phi(\tau)) \,.\label{eq:kappatau}
\end{align}
The leading order wave-functionals in the classically non-allowed and allowed regions respectively are determined by the WKB matching conditions. Consider the case in which the classically forbiden region is located at $\tau > \tau_0$, then the wave functionals in the classically allowed and in the classically forbidden regions are respectively
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi[\phi] &=& \frac{2 A}{\sqrt{k} } \cos\left(\int_\tau^{\tau_0} k(\phi(\tau)) d\tau - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \frac{B}{\sqrt{k}} \sin\left(\int_\tau^{\tau_0} k(\phi(\tau)) d\tau - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \,, \nonumber \\
\Psi[\phi] &=& \frac{A}{\sqrt{\kappa} } \exp\left(-\int_{\tau_0}^{\tau} \kappa(\phi(\tau)) d\tau\right) + \frac{B}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \exp\left(\int^\tau_{\tau_0} \kappa(\phi(\tau)) d\tau \right) \,,
\label{eq:WKB1}
\end{eqnarray}

If the classically forbidden region is located at $\tau < \tau_0$, the wave-functionals are
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi[\phi] &=& \frac{A}{\sqrt{\kappa} } \exp\left(-\int_{\tau_0}^{\tau} \kappa(\phi(\tau)) d\tau\right) + \frac{B}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \exp\left(\int^\tau_{\tau_0} \kappa(\phi(\tau)) d\tau\right) \,, \nonumber \\
\Psi[\phi] &=& \frac{2 A}{\sqrt{k} } \cos\left(\int_\tau^{\tau_0} k(\phi(\tau)) d\tau - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \frac{B}{\sqrt{k}} \sin\left(\int_\tau^{\tau_0} k(\phi(\tau)) d\tau - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \,,
\label{eq:WKB2}
\end{eqnarray}
In the above we've only kept the pre-factor corresponding to  longitudinal fluctuations of the field i.e. corresponding to the first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:S1-2}. The second term coming from transverse fluctuations is not explicitly written since it plays no role in the further discussion. 

Now recall that the classically allowed and forbidden regions are defined in terms of the potential $U[\phi]$, that depends on the specific path in the field space chosen to perform the integration. Hence they cannot be visualised in the potentials of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}. However, we can expect that for a generic path in field space, it would take a form that is similar to that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}, with a finite barrier in the middle and infinite barriers on both sides for the case of the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}, and on the left side only for the case of the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialUFlatSpace}. At this point we will distinguish between the two cases.

\subsection{WKB for decay in a two-vacua potential}

In the case of the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialUFlatSpace}, we can identify five different regions, three of which are classically disallowed ($1$, $3$ and $5$) while two are classically allowed ($2$ and $4$). We impose that in region $1$ the decaying component of the wave-functional is absent, hence $B_1 = 0$ and
\begin{equation}
\Psi_1[\phi] = \frac{A_1}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \exp\left(- \int_\tau^{a} \kappa d\tau \right) \,.
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:WKB2} we can easily find that
\begin{equation}
A_2 = \left(\cos\theta e^{-i\pi/4} + \sin\theta e^{i\pi/4}\right) A_1 \,, \qquad B_2 = \left(\cos\theta e^{i\pi/4} +\sin\theta e^{-i\pi/4}\right) A_1 \,,
\end{equation}
where
$\theta = \int_{a}^{b} k d\tau \,, $ 
so that
\begin{equation}
\Psi_2[\phi] = \frac{A_2}{\sqrt{k}} \exp\left(i \int_b^\tau k d\tau\right) + \frac{B_2}{\sqrt{k}} \exp\left(-i \int_b^\tau k d\tau\right) \,.
\end{equation}
The connection between the regions $2$ and $4$ can be easily found by using the following connection formula, see~\cite{Merzbacher:1998}
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
A_4 \\ B_4
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2 \lambda} + 2 \lambda & i \left(\frac{1}{2 \lambda} - 2 \lambda\right) \\ - i \left(\frac{1}{2 \lambda} - 2 \lambda\right) & \frac{1}{2 \lambda} + 2 \lambda
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
A_2 \\ B_2
\end{pmatrix} \,,
\end{equation}
where
$\lambda = \exp\left(\int_b^c \kappa d \tau\right)$.
We find that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A4B4}
A_4 = e^{i\pi/4} \frac{A_2}{2 \lambda} (\sin\theta - 4 i \cos\theta \lambda^2) \,, \qquad B_4 = e^{i\pi/4} \frac{A_2}{2 \lambda} (-i\sin\theta + 4 \cos\theta \lambda^2) \,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
so that the wave-functional takes the form
\begin{equation}
\Psi_4[\phi] = \frac{A_4}{\sqrt{k}} \exp\left(i \int_c^\tau k d\tau\right) + \frac{B_4}{\sqrt{k}} \exp\left(-i \int_c^\tau k d\tau\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:WKB1} we find that
\begin{equation}
A_5 = \frac{A_4 e^{i \omega} + B_4 e^{-i\omega}}{2} \,, \qquad B_5 = i(A_4 e^{i\omega} - B_4 e^{-i\omega}) \,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
where
$\omega = \int_c^d k d\tau \, $, 
so that
\begin{equation}
\Psi_5[\phi] = \frac{A_5}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \exp\left(-\int_d^\tau \kappa d\tau \right) + \frac{B_5}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \exp\left(\int_d^\tau \kappa d\tau\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Of course, we need to require that the rising component of the wave-functional is absent in region $5$, namely that $B_5 = 0$. This implies
\begin{equation}
- 4 \lambda^2 \left(1 + i e^{2 i \omega}\right) \cos\theta + i \left(1 - i e^{2 i \omega}\right) \sin\theta = 0 \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
which is satisfied if
\begin{eqnarray}
\cos\theta &=& 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \omega = -\frac{\pi}{4} + n \pi \quad (n \in \mathbb{Z}) \,, \quad \text{or} \nonumber  \\
\sin\theta &=& 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \omega = \frac{\pi}{4} + n \pi \quad (n \in \mathbb{Z}) \,. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
However, note that if we require that $\sin\theta = 0$, the coefficients $A_4$ and $B_4$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:A4B4} would be enhanced with respect to $A_2$ and $B_2$ by a factor $\propto \lambda$. If the initial condition of the process is a homogeneous configuration with the field in the false vacuum, we expect that the coefficients $A_4$ and $B_4$ are suppressed with respect to $A_2$ and $B_2$, therefore we need to impose $\cos\theta = 0$. Note that the leading order of the transmission coefficient $T^2 = \frac{|\Psi_4[\phi]|^2}{|\Psi_2[\phi]|^2}$ is given by the factor $1/\lambda^2$ and gives a measure of the decay rate, despite in this case it is not possible to formally define it in terms of the S-matrix, unlike the case discussed in the next section. At leading order then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DecayRateWKB}
\Gamma \sim T^2 \sim \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \propto \exp\left(-2 \int_b^c\kappa d\tau\right) \,,
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to the CDL result.

It is particularly interesting to notice that the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateWKB} is equivalent to the Euclidean action evaluated on the bounce solution, upon subtraction of the background action. Let us make this statement more explicit: between the two turning points $b$ and $c$, the potential energy is larger than the total energy $E$ of the system. As the total energy is given by the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy, the kinetic energy has to be negative. This can be achieved by rotating the time variable to the Euclidean time, that gains an imaginary unit and makes the kinetic energy negative. Hence, in the under-the-barrier region (between $b$ and $c$) it is totally justified to rotate to Euclidean time $s = i t$, where $t$ is the usual Lorentzian time. The Euclidean action is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EuclideanAction}
S_E[\phi(s)] = \int ds \left[ \int d^3 x \, \left( \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d\phi(s)}{ds}\right)^2 \right) + U[\phi(s)]\right] \,.
\end{equation}
The Euclidean energy is conserved, which implies
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EuclideanEnergyConservation}
\int d^3 x \, \left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d\phi(s)}{ds}\right)^2\right) - U[\phi(s)] = -E \,,
\end{equation}
where we take $E = U[\phi_A]$\footnote{Note that in the case of the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace}, $E = U[\phi_A] = 0$.} (despite the WKB argument holds for a general $E$), assuming that the initial state is a homogeneous field configuration $\phi = \phi_A$. Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:EuclideanEnergyConservation}, and noting that, in the under-the-barrier region
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tau}{ds} = \sqrt{2(U[\phi(s)] - U[\phi_A])} \,,
\end{equation}
the Euclidean action in Eq.~\eqref{eq:EuclideanAction} becomes simply
\begin{eqnarray}
S_E[\phi(s)] &=& \int ds \left[ \int d^3 x \, \left( \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d\phi(s)}{ds}\right)^2 \right) + U[\phi(s)]\right] = \nonumber \\
&=& \int ds \left[2 (U[\phi(s)] - U[\phi_A])\right] + \int ds \, U[\phi_A] = \nonumber \\
&=& \int_b^c d\tau \sqrt{2(U[\phi(s)] - U(\phi_A))} + S_E^{\rm back} \,,
\label{eq:EuclideanAction2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $S_E^{\rm back}$ is the background Euclidean action evaluated on the homogeneous solution $\phi = \phi_A$. Therefore
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad S_E[\phi(s)] - S_E^{\rm back} = \int_b^c d\tau \kappa \,,\quad }
\end{equation}
which shows the equivalence between the Euclidean action evaluated on the bounce solution (upon subtracting the background action) and the usual WKB factor of Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateWKB}.

Of course, the resort to the use of the Euclidean action is just a trick that sometimes makes the computation easier and is completely justified quantum mechanically, as it reproduces exactly the WKB result. However, there is no intrinsic reason to use the bounce solution for the post-nucleation phase: up to Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateWKB} we have not introduced Euclidean time and the Euclidean action, and these are actually not needed to get to the final result. The quantum mechanics problem only knows about the symmetries that are put in the problem from the very beginning: for instance one can require from the start that the problem has a spherical $O(3)$ symmetry. There is no way for the post-nucleation solution to gain a $\sqrt{t^2 - |x|^2}$ dependence, as it is usually obtained by naively rotating back to Lorentzian signature the bounce solution.

\subsection{WKB for decay in run-away potential}

In the case of the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialFlatSpace} we can give an explicit definition of the decay rate, as we can discuss  the question in terms  of an S-matrix. We have in mind a state which comes in from the right, tunnels through the barrier, is reflected off the wall on the left and tunnels through the barrier back to give an outgoing state to the right. The resonances that can be formed in this process constitute the decaying state that we are interested in. The S-matrix is a phase ($S=A_{4}/B_{4}$) with complex poles corresponding to the bound states in region 2. To identify the decay widths of the corresponding resonances we first identify the bound states - these correspond to 
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \theta = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\pi  \quad (n \in \mathbb{Z})\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the last expression determines the possible discrete values of the energy $E_n$: in fact the energy appears both in the limits of integration (as it determines the turning points) and in the integrand (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:ktau} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:kappatau}). Considering the lowest energy state $E_0$ and expanding around this point we can write (see~\cite{Merzbacher:1998})
\begin{equation}
\cos \theta\simeq\mp(E-E_{0})\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)\bigg|_{E = E_0} \,, \qquad \sin \theta\bigg|_{E = E_0} \simeq 1 \,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
and get
\begin{equation}
S\equiv\frac{A_4}{B_4}=\frac{E-E_{0}-i\left[ 1/\left(4\theta{}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)|_{E = E_0}\right)\right] }{E-E_{0}+i\left[ 1/(\left(4\theta{}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)|_{E = E_0}\right)\right] }\equiv e^{2i\phi}=\frac{E-E_{0}-i\Gamma/2}{E-E_{0}+i\Gamma/2} \,.
\end{equation}
with the decay width given by
\begin{equation}
\Gamma=\frac{1}{2\lambda^{2}}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)^{-1}\bigg|_{E = E_0} \,.
\end{equation}
The phase shift $\phi$ has then the standard form
\begin{equation}
\tan\phi=\frac{\Gamma/2}{E-E_{0}} \,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
with the lifetime of the resonance given by
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align}
& \nonumber \\
\qquad \Gamma^{-1} &=2\lambda^{2}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)\bigg|_{E = E_0} \quad \nonumber \\
\qquad &=\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial E}\int_{a}^{b}d\tau\sqrt{2\left(E-U(\tau\right)})\bigg|_{0}\right]2\exp\left[2\int_{b}^{c}d\tau\sqrt{2\left(U(\tau\right)-E})\right]\,.\quad \nonumber \\
\label{eq:lifetime}
\end{empheq}
Note that $2\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial E}\right)\bigg|_{E = E_0}$is the
classical period for oscillations between $a$ to $b$ and one could
have divided the transition probability i.e. the WKB factor in Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateWKB} to get this formula heuristically, while here we have derived it purely from quantum mechanical considerations.

\subsection{Comparison to Coleman's formula}
\label{sec:ScalarFieldComparison}

We showed above that the exponential term in the life-time of the false vacuum is (for the particular case where the energy corresponds to the energy at the minimum of the potential) is the same as in Coleman's calculation. On the other hand the pre-factor  is quite different from that in  the well-known formula derived by Coleman~\cite{Coleman:1977py, Callan:1977pt}. However the derivation in the latter papers is not quite a straightforward application of WKB quantum mechanics but involve a series of additional assumptions whose status we discuss below.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Some issues with Coleman's argument}
Let us summarise some of the weak points with Coleman's original approach \footnote{See~\cite{Andreassen:2016cvx} for related critical comments.}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Hamiltonian $H$ is Hermitian - its eigenvalues are necessarily real. Coleman makes essential use of the heuristic interpretation of $\Gamma$ as the imaginary part of an eigenvalue of $ H$ and the dilute gas approximation in order to get the decay rate. The calculation leading to Eq.~\eqref{eq:lifetime} used no such interpretation - $\Gamma$ is extracted from the $S$-matrix for the scattering of a field configuration from a potential which can accommodate quasi-bound states (resonances).
\item Coleman's calculation disagrees in the pre-factor from the standard WKB calculation (i.e. essentially Eq.~\eqref{eq:lifetime} with $U$ now being the quantum mechanical potential). In particular Coleman's formula for the decay rate $\Gamma$ involves dividing by the (infinite) translation symmetry of his instanton i.e. the pre-factor for the transition probability contains a factor $T\rightarrow\infty$ that is divided out to get the rate. In the calculation above there is no such factor and effectively the division is by the classical period for oscillations in the potential well.
\item The last factor of Eq.~\eqref{eq:lifetime} is the square of the standard WKB decay amplitude and naturally is the same as in Coleman's formula with also the identification of the exponent as the difference between the Euclidean classical action for a classical solution with the appropriate boundary conditions and the action for a particle whose position is localised in the well (at its minimum). 
\item In the field theory case Coleman gives an argument for the dominant contribution to this last factor to come from a Euclidean 4-sphere configuration. However in the actual evaluation of the decay amplitude the thin-wall approximation is used in which the under the barrier region effectively shrinks to a brane. On the other hand propagation in the classically allowed region to the right of the barrier is described in terms of the analytic continuation of this Euclidean instanton. The justification for the latter is unclear.
\item Of course one would like to have a quantum field theory argument for a physical picture of a first order phase transition with bubble nucleation and percolation. Coleman's argument is clearly motivated by this and indeed it would be nice to have a rigorous QFT justification for this. Unfortunately we do not see at this point how to achieve this.
\end{itemize}

\section{Vacuum decay in curved space}
\label{sec:DecayCurvedSpace}

\subsection{Review of Coleman-De Luccia}
\label{sec:CDLReview}

The application of Coleman's arguments to the case involving gravity are even more problematic. Apart from the issues highlighted above there is the problem that the notion of time (and hence that of transition probability per unit time) needs to be reinterpreted given that the WDW equation does not admit the usual notion of time. Let us first discuss the Euclidean mini-superspace case as given by CDL for the case $dS\rightarrow{\cal M}$ and generalised to $dS\rightarrow dS$
by Parke~\cite{Parke:1982pm}. Putting $t=i\tau$ and $a(t)=\rho(\tau)$ and gauge fixing to $N=1$ we have the metric $ds^{2}=d\tau^{2}+\rho^{2}(\tau)d\Omega_{3}^{2}$. The relevant Euclidean equation of motion then is the $\tau\tau$ component of the Einstein equation which reads ($\rho'=d\rho/d\tau,$etc.)
\begin{equation}
\rho'^{2}=1+\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\phi'^{2}-V(\phi)\rho^{2}\right).\label{eq:rho}
\end{equation}
The Euclidean action is 
\begin{align}
S_{E} & =-2\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\tau_{{\rm max}}}d\tau\left[3\rho+3\rho\rho'^{2}-V\rho^{3}-\rho^{3}\frac{1}{2}\phi'^{2}\right]\nonumber \\
 & =-12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\tau_{{\rm max}}}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V\rho^{3}\right]\,.\label{eq:SE}
\end{align}
In the last step we used the equation of motion in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho}. In this Euclidean argument this is supposed to be the instanton (bounce) action with $\phi(0)=\phi_{B}$ i.e. the value of the field at the so-called true minimum and $\phi(\infty)=\phi_{A}$, the value of the field in the false minimum. Of course there is complete symmetry between the two so the bounce action is the same for going from $A\rightarrow B$ or $B\rightarrow A$. The difference between up-tunneling (true to false vacuum) and down-tunneling (false to true) just comes from the fact that the background action which is subtracted to get the tunneling amplitude is different. So in the case of down-tunneling that we will consider here (i.e. $A\rightarrow B)$ the tunneling amplitude is
given by $e^{B/2}$ where,
\begin{equation}
\frac{B}{2}=S_{E}-S_{E}^{A}\label{eq:B1-1}
\end{equation}
 where the second term is the action for $\phi$ remaining at the
false minimum $\phi_{A}.$ i.e. 
\[
S_{E}^{A}=-12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\tau_{{\rm max}}}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V_{A}\rho^{3}\right],
\]
where $V_{A}=V(\phi_{A})$. Hence we have 
\begin{align}
\frac{B}{2}& =-12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\tau_{{\rm max}}}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V\rho^{3}\right]+12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\tau_{{\rm max}}}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V_{A}\rho^{3}\right]\nonumber \\
 & =-12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\bar{\tau}-\delta\tau}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V_{B}\rho^{3}\right]+2\pi^{2}\bar{\rho}^{3}T+12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\bar{\tau}-\delta\tau}d\tau\left[\rho-\frac{1}{3}V_{A}\rho^{3}\right]\label{eq:B2-1}
\end{align}
In the second line we have assumed that beyond the point $\bar{\tau}+\delta\tau$,
$V\simeq V_{A}$ so that the contribution from $\bar{\tau}+\delta\tau$
to $\text{\ensuremath{\tau_{{\rm max}}}}$ in the first term of the
first line cancels against the second term. Also $T$ in the middle
term is defined by 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\rho}^{3}T=2\int_{\bar{\tau}-\delta\tau}^{\bar{\tau}+\delta\tau}d\tau\rho^{3}(V(\phi(\tau)-V_{A}).\label{eq:T}
\end{equation}
 In the second line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:B2-1} we have taken the path
in $\tau$ such that for $0<\tau\le$ $\bar{\tau}-\delta\tau$, $\phi$
is held fixed at $\phi_{B}$ while in the interval $\bar{\tau}+\delta\tau\le\tau<\tau_{{\rm max}}$,
$\phi=\phi_{A}$. So in the first and third terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:B2-1}
we can replace the integral over $d\tau=\frac{d\tau}{d\rho}d\rho$
using the Euclidean Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho} with $\phi$ fixed\footnote{Although not explicitly stated this seems to have been assumed also
in~\cite{Parke:1982pm}.}. This gives $\frac{d\tau}{d\rho}=\pm1/\sqrt{1-V_{B,A}\rho^{2}}$
in the first and third terms\footnote{In~\cite{Parke:1982pm} only the positive sign is kept here.}
so these integrations can be done giving us (in the thin wall limit
$\delta \tau\rightarrow0$),
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad \frac{B}{2}=-12\pi^{2}\left[\pm\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}V_{A}\bar{\rho}^{2}\right)^{3/2}-1}{V_{A}}\mp\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}V_{B}\bar{\rho}^{2}\right)^{3/2}-1}{V_{B}}\right]+2\pi^{2}\bar{\rho}^{3}T.\quad }\label{eq:B3}
\end{equation}
$\bar{\rho}$ is then determined by extremising $B$. Upon substituting
this value into the above one then gets the usual expressions which
we will quote later after re-deriving the above without invoking
Euclidean arguments with their corresponding interpretational issues.

\subsection{Vacuum transitions in mini-superspace}
\label{sec:CDLfromWDW}

An instructive exercise, that helps understanding the formalism outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:WKBandWDW} and shows the differences between the Lorentzian and Euclidean appproaches, consists in studying vacuum transitions in a mini-superspace setup that includes a real scalar field. This calculation is a generalization of the ‘tunneling from nothing’ scenario~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp,Linde:1983mx}. For a recent discussion see for instance~\cite{Kristiano:2018oyv,deAlwis:2018sec,Halliwell:2018ejl}. The metric is 
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=-N^{2}(t)dt^{2}+a^{2}(t)(dr^{2}+\sin^{2}rd\Omega_{2}^{2}) \,. \label{eq:minimetric}
\end{equation}
The action (setting $M_p=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}=1$) is given by the sum $S=S_{g}+S_{m}$, where 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{g} & = & 2\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{1}dt\left(-N^{-1}3a\dot{a}^{2}+3kaN\right) \,,\label{eq:Sg}\\
S_{m} & = & 2\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{1}dt\left(N^{-1}\frac{1}{2}a^{3}\dot{\phi}^{2}-Na^{3}V(\phi)\right) \,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $k=\pm1,0$ depending on whether the three-spatial slice is positively (negatively)
curved or flat. Of course  in the open $k=0,-1$ cases the factor $2\pi^{2}$ would have to be replaced by an appropriate compactified volume factor and the spatial metric in Eq.~\eqref{eq:minimetric} would need to be replaced by a flat or hyperbolic metric. Here we will focus on the $k=+1 $ case and for  convenience we will drop the $2\pi^{2}$ factor in the calculations below and restore it in the expressions for the classical action. We will make some remarks at end on the other two cases. The canonical momenta are
\begin{equation}
\pi_{N}=0\,, \qquad \pi_{a}=-N^{-1}6a\dot{a} \,,\qquad \pi_{\phi}=N^{-1}a^{3}\dot{\phi} \,,\label{eq:momenta}
\end{equation}
and the Hamiltonian constraint is 
\begin{equation}
{\cal H}=N\left(-\frac{\pi_{a}^{2}}{12a}+\frac{\pi_{\phi}^{2}}{2a^{3}}-3a+a^{3}V(\phi)\right)\approx 0 \,.\label{eq:calH}
\end{equation}


Comparing with Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralHamiltonian} we have
\begin{gather}
G^{aa} = -\frac{1}{6a} \,,\qquad G^{\phi\phi}=\frac{1}{a^{3}},\label{eq:G-1}\\
f(a,\phi) = -3a+a^{3}V(\phi).\label{eq:faphi}
\end{gather}
Consider a scalar potential with two dS minima in $\phi_A$ and $\phi_B$, with $V(\phi_A) \equiv V_A > V_B \equiv V(\phi_B)$. Then the general shape of the function $f(a, \phi)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:faphi} is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Path}.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3, trim=0cm 2cm 0cm 1.8cm,clip]{Path.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:Path}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

As we emphasised before, the superspace metric is not positive definite in the presence of gravity and this introduces significant differences to  WKB type tunneling arguments. As can be seen from this constraint equation in the absence of the scalar field (this is the `tunneling from nothing' model of~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Vilenkin:1984wp,Linde:1983mx}), one has a barrier at fixed $\phi$ for the scale factor $a$ when $a<\sqrt{3/V}$  whereas if the geometry is fixed (as in the original investigations of Coleman et al.) then there is a barrier for $\phi$ when $V$ is greater than its value at the point where $\pi_{\phi}$ becomes zero. However it is clear that these simple situations are not the only possibilities when both $a$ and $\phi$ are present. The following is to our knowledge the first time this more complex situation is discussed.

\subsection{Recovering Coleman-De Luccia}
\label{sec:RecoveringCDL}

It is instructive to try and recover the CDL expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:B3} using the formalism of Sec.~\ref{sec:WKBandWDW}. Hopefully, this might help us in better understanding CDL. Let us choose the deformation parameter $s$ (in analogy with the Euclidean
time $\tau$) such that from some initial value (say at $s=0$) to
the point $\bar{s}-\delta s$ the field $\phi$ remains very close
to $\phi_{B}$ and for points $s_{\max}>s>\bar{s}+\epsilon$, $\phi$
becomes close to $\phi_{A}$. It should be emphsised here that $s$
has nothing to do with real time - it is simply a deformation parameter
that parametrises the path of integration. The range $\bar{s}-\epsilon<s<\bar{s}+\epsilon$
is the transitional region where in effect CDL used the thin wall
approximation. Thus the classical action (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:S0intf})
is 
\begin{small}
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{B};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A}) & = & -12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{s_{{\rm max}}}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V(\phi)}{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & -12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{\bar{s}-\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{B}}{3}\right)-12\pi^{2}\int_{\bar{s}-\delta s}^{\bar{s}+\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V(\phi)}{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & -12\pi^{2}\int_{s+\delta s}^{s_{{\rm max}}}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right).\label{eq:SAB1}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{small}
Here in the first term we have used the fact that $\phi$ remains constant
and equal to $\phi_{B}$ while in the last term it remains equal to
$\phi_{A}.$ 

This path corresponds to the Euclidean path chosen by CDL and Parke. Thus in the Lorentzian case this action corresponds to ‘tunneling from nothing’, as in Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin-Linde~\cite{Vilenkin:1982de, Hartle:1983ai, Linde:1983mx} wave function of the universe arguments, essentially keeping $\phi$ fixed, to the potentially emergent state $B$ (the true vacuum in CDL's language), then making a transition to the state $A$ (where both $\phi$ and $a$ can change), that then emerges as the classical background space time. This is then to be compared to the situation where the the state $A$ emerges from a ‘tunneling from nothing’ process. The latter gives an action 
\begin{equation}
S_{0}(a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A};a_{0},\phi_{A})=-12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right).\label{eq:SA}
\end{equation}
Now we have from Eq.~\eqref{eq:dtauds} 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{d\tau}{ds}\right)^{2}=-6a\left(\frac{da}{ds}\right)^{2}+2a^{3}\left(\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right)^{2}=-2C^{-2}(s)(-3a+a^{3}V(\phi))\label{eq:dtauds-1} \,.
\end{equation}
Thus as long as $a^{2}<3/V(\phi$), for a ``time-like'' trajectory in field space $C^{2}=-1$. In particular this would be the case for $d\phi/ds=0$. For the moment though we will leave this undetermined. 

The transition probability is given by (ignoring the pre-factors for
the moment),
\begin{equation}
P(A\rightarrow B)=\bigg|\frac{\Psi(a_{0},\phi_{B};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}{\Psi(a_{0},\phi_{A};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}\bigg|^{2}=\bigg|\frac{\alpha e^{iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{B};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}+\beta e^{-iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{B};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}}{\alpha e^{iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{A};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}+\beta e^{-iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{A};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})}}\bigg|^{2}\equiv e^{-B}\label{eq:PAB} \,.
\end{equation}
The dominant term in this ratio will be exponentially larger than
the subdominant terms so the latter may be safely ignored.
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{B}{2} & = & iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{B};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A})-iS_{0}(a_{0},\phi_{A};a_{{\rm max}},\phi_{A}) \label{eq:B1} \\
 & = & -12\pi^{2}i\int_{0}^{\bar{s}-\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{B}}{3}\right)-12\pi^{2}i\int_{\bar{s}-\delta s}^{\bar{s}+\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V(\phi)}{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & -12\pi^{2}i\int_{\bar{s}+\delta s}^{s_{{\rm max}}}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right)+12\pi^{2}i\int_{0}^{s_{{\rm max}}}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right) \,, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where we have chosen to keep $C$ - so the choice of phase is so far
undetermined. After some cancellations this may be rewritten as
\begin{align}
\pm \frac{B}{2} & =-12\pi{}^{2}i\int_{0}^{\bar{s}-\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{B}}{3}\right)+12\pi^{2}i\int_{0}^{\bar{s}-\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(-a+a^{3}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 & +2\pi^{2}\bar{a}^{3}T.\label{eq:B2}
\end{align}
where we have defined the tension $T$ in analogy with Eq.~\eqref{eq:T}, as the contribution to the action coming from the portion of the path such that $d\phi/ds \neq 0$
\begin{equation}
2\pi^{2}\bar{a}^{3}T=12\pi^{2}i\int_{\bar{s}-\delta s}^{s+\delta s}ds'C^{-1}(s')\left(a^{3}\frac{V(\phi)-V_{A}}{3}\right)\label{eq:T2}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that, despite the contribution in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T2} is similar to Eq.~\eqref{eq:T}, there is no physical wall in the process that we are considering, that preserves the full $O(4)$ symmetry of the minisuperspace model.
So far we have not made any approximation. The terms in the first
line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:B2} will now be evaluated (as in the corresponding
Euclidean case) keeping $\phi$ constant. So we may use $\frac{da}{ds'}=\pm\sqrt{1-\frac{V_{A,B}}{3}a^{2}}$
(see Eq.~\eqref{eq:dtauds-1} with $d\phi/ds=0$ which implies $C^{2}=-1$).
We will also assume that the last term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:B2} is also integrated over a time-like path in field space - so that we can choose $C^{2}=-1$ along this path as well, which requires of course that $da/ds$ is non-zero along this path. Hence
\begin{equation}
S_{0}^{A,B}=\pm i12\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{a}daa\sqrt{\left(1-a^{2}\frac{V_{A,B}}{3}\right)}=\mp i12\pi^{2}\frac{1}{V_{A}}\left\{ \left(1-a^{2}\frac{V_{A,B}}{3}\right)^{3/2}-1\right\} \label{eq:SA2}
\end{equation}
Thus we have (putting $a(\bar{s}\pm\delta s)=\bar{a}\pm\delta a$)


\begin{eqnarray}
\pm \frac{B}{2} & = & 12\pi^{2}\left\{ \frac{1}{V_{B}}\left[\left(1-\left(\bar{a}-\delta a\right)^{2}\frac{V_{B}}{3}\right)^{3/2}-1\right]-\frac{1}{V_{A}}\left[\left(1-\left(\bar{a}-\delta a\right)^{2}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right)^{3/2}-1\right]\right\} \quad \nonumber \\
\quad  & + & 2\pi^{2}\bar{a}^{3}T\,.
\end{eqnarray}



\subsection{Concrete cases}
\label{sec:ThinWallApproximation}

Let us now consider several cases to identify the transition amplitudes using our formalism.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Thin wall CDL}. 
Let us try to recover the CDL resukt in the thin wall approximation. We can evaluate the last equation in the thin wall approximation. In this
case the potential essentially reduces to a brane so that effectively
we may write the argument of the integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T2} in the limit $\delta s\rightarrow0$
as a delta function. Then the logarithm of the transition amplitude becomes
\begin{align}
\pm \frac{B}{2} & =12\pi^{2}\left\{ \pm\frac{1}{V_{B}}\left[\left(1-\bar{a}^{2}\frac{V_{B}}{3}\right)^{3/2}-1\right]\mp\frac{1}{V_{A}}\left[\left(1-\bar{a}^{2}\frac{V_{A}}{3}\right)^{3/2}-1\right]\right\} \nonumber \\
 & +2\pi^{2}\bar{a}^{3}T \,.\label{eq:Bthinwall}
\end{align}
This is the same expression as Eq.~\eqref{eq:B3}. It is also clear that
this is the sum of two Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin-Linde terms and\footnote{Note that in the thin wall approximation the integrals in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:T2} imply that in the region around $\bar{s}$ the potential takes the form $a^{3}(s)\left(V(\phi(s))-V_{A}\right)=2\bar{a}^{3}T\delta(s-\bar{s})$.} and a term coming from the portion of the path where $d\phi/ds \neq 0$, that in the CDL computation corresponds to the wall tension contribution. However, notice that we recovered the CDL expression for the tunnelling probability, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} without having to go to Euclidean space, but just using WKB quantum
mechanics and assuming that, for the path that extremizes the action, $C^{-1}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T2} is imaginary. Extremizing Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} gives the standard (generalised) CDL expression for transitions between two dS spaces (or AdS with
appropriate sign changes). The extremum is at 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\bar{a}^{2}}=\frac{V_{B}}{3}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{2}{T}\frac{\Delta V}{3}+\frac{T}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{V_{A}}{3}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{2}{T}\frac{\Delta V}{3}-\frac{T}{2}\right)^{2},\label{eq:abar}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta V=V_{A}-V_{B}$. Note that this expression shows that $\bar{a}$ is less than the horizon radius of both $A$ and $B$.
Putting this into Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} gives the final expression (with $H^{2}\equiv V/3$)
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad B=\pm8\pi^{2}\left[\frac{\left\{ \left(H_{A}^{2}-H_{B}^{2}\right)^{2}+T^{2}\left(H_{A}^{2}+H_{B}^{2}\right)\right\} \bar{a}}{4TH_{A}^{2}H_{B}^{2}}-\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{B}^{-2}-H_{A}^{-2}\right)\right].\quad }\label{eq:Bthinwallextr}
\end{equation}
This is of course the well-known result. However its derivation and
interpretation is quite different from that of CDL (and subsequent
work which generalised the CDL result). Firstly we did not explicitly
use Coleman's tunneling formula - instead we directly solved the WDW
equation in the classical approximation, as a deformation of the solution
where the initial configuration is one in which the fields correspond
to a dS space (with vacuum energy  $V_{A}$ and compared it to
the undeformed configuration).

However, there are a few puzzles posed by this calculation as we discuss next.
\item{\bf Hartle-Hawking interpretation}. 

As the
last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} is positive, it increases the absolute value of $B$ and
hence decreases the tunneling probabilty. On the other hand, one can simply ask what is the relative probability of ‘tunneling from nothing’ to the state $B$ compared to ‘tunneling from nothing’ to the state $A$. In other words one might compute the following ratio
\begin{equation}
\frac{B}{2} = \frac{\left|\Psi(a_0, \phi_B; a_{\rm max}, \phi_B)\right|^2}{\left|\Psi(a_0, \phi_A; a_{\rm max}, \phi_A)\right|^2} \,,
\end{equation}
with $a_{\rm max} \geq \rm{max}(\sqrt{(3/V_A)}, \sqrt{3/V_B})$. The result would then be given by the top line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} (i.e. the two Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin-Linde terms) with no tension term. Note that, even though the integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} in this case extends till $a_{\rm max}$, only the integrals up to $\sqrt{3/V_A}$ and $\sqrt{3/V_B}$ contribute to the real part of $B$. Hence, for instance, the factor $\left(1 - \frac{\bar{a}^2 V_B}{3}\right)^{3/2}$ evaluated at $\bar{a}^2 > 3/V_B$ gives no contribution to $B$ and analogously for the term containing $V_A$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall}. Hence the relative
probability is now given by $P=e^{-B}$ with 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad B=24\pi^{2}\left\{ \mp\frac{1}{V_{B}}\pm\frac{1}{V_{A}}\right\} .\quad }\label{eq:HHV}
\end{equation}
This is simply the ratio of the Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin-Linde (depending on the choice of sign) probabilities for tunneling from ‘nothing’ to the state $B$ compared to tunneling from ‘nothing’ to the state $A$. Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:HHV} might be interpreted as the tunnelling rate for the transition dS A $\rightarrow$ ‘nothing’ $\rightarrow$ dS B (or the opposite, depending on the choice of the signs). Interestingly, it seems that this would give a greater probability for transition than the CDL calculation. In this connection it should be pointed out that in the Hartle-Hawking case the wave function in the classical region is indeed a superposition of wave functions for expanding and contracting universes. The process we are envisaging may then be thought of as the contracting branch with the field sitting at the $A$ minimum tunneling to ‘nothing’ and then reemerging as an expanding branch in the $B$ minimum or the reverse.

\item{\bf CDL vs Hartle-Hawking}. 

In the Lorentzian analog of the CDL calculation on the other hand,  it is not clear how the true vacuum (i.e. $B$) emerges into the classical region. In CDL, the tunnelling rate is computed exactly with the same integral as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:B1}. However, in CDL this is interpreted as the action for a Euclidean configuration given by a compound state that joins two portions of 4-spheres (corresponding to dS B and dS A) along a 3-sphere (the wall): the $SO(5)$ symmetry of the Euclidean four dimensional dS is broken to $SO(4)$ by the presence of the ‘Euclidean’ wall. Afterwards, as described in App.~\ref{sec:dSGeometry}, one of the angular variables that implements the $SO(4)$ symmetry, is analytically continued and becomes the usual Lorentzian time, breaking the symmetry to $SO(1,3)$. In this way, the initial under-the-barrier Euclidean configuration (the compound state) becomes the real three-dimensional equal-time slice of the nucleated spacetime. As the continued angular variable is one that preserves the Euclidean $SO(4)$ symmetry, the nucleated spacetime is still a compound state of dS A and dS B: both dS spacetimes enter the classical region and keep evolving according to the classical equations of motion.



In our computation, the integral of Eq.~\eqref{eq:B1} (that we chose in order to recover the same CDL expression, and try to give it a Lorentzian interpretation) is associated with a particular path in field space that, starting from the configuration $(a_0, \phi_B)$ (‘B nothing’) leads to the nucleation of a full dS A sphere, i.e. the configuration $(a_{\rm max}, \phi_A)$. This has to be contrasted, as described in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PAB} with the path that, starting from the configuration $(a_0, \phi_A)$ leads to the same full dS A sphere as above. Essentially we are comparing 3-geometries, which is all one can do in the context of quantum gravity as described by the WDW equation.



In our procedure we neither need a dilute gas approximation nor a single negative mode in the spectrum of fluctuations as in the CDL flat space argument. Furthermore, there is no notion of bubble nucleation. Both the numerator and the denominator in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PAB} correspond to spacetime configurations that preserve the $SO(4)$ symmetry. To be more explicit, the portion of the path that corresponds to the dS B is always under the barrier in the Lorentzian case: the computation relies on the fact that $\bar{a}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} after extremizing is located in the under-the-barrier region, so that the integrands of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SA2} give an imaginary contribution and the resulting $B$ is real. In the Lorentzian approach, the dS spacetime B never sees the light of the classical region. Hence, in the present case built on the CDL argument how $B$ emerges as
a classical space-time is not at all clear. 

Our computation relies on the fact that the path in field space extremising the action can be split as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:RecoveringCDL}, and that it is such that $C^{-1}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T2} is imaginary. If the latter condition holds, the portion of the path such that $d\phi/ds \neq 0$ contributes to the imaginary action, bringing a term which is the analogous of Eq.~\eqref{eq:T} in the Euclidean computation. In general, this is not necessarily the case and one should compute the value of the action for the path that solves the equation of motion. In order to compute the contribution to the imaginary part of the action of a given path, it is sometimes more convenient to use the distance on field space as the parameter $s$, in which case the action for the wave function in the numerator of Eq.~\eqref{eq:PAB} can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:GeneralExplicitAction}
S_0[a_0, \phi_B; a_{\rm max}, \phi_A] = 2 \pi^2 \int_{a_0, \phi_B}^{a_{\rm max}, \phi_A} \left[-6a da^2 + a^3 d\phi^2\right]^{1/2} \, \left[6a\left(1 - \frac{a^2 V(\phi)}{3}\right)\right]^{1/2} \,.
\end{eqnarray}

Hence, only the portions of the path such that the product of the two square roots in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralExplicitAction} is imaginary contribute to the imaginary part of the path, and hence to the tunnelling rate.
\item{\bf Standard classical paths}.  It is interesting to notice that, due to the presence of a non-positive definite superspace metric, it is possible to find a classical solution that connects two dS spacetimes A and B. To illustrate this point, consider first the usual Hartle-Hawking transition, as a special case of Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralExplicitAction}. If we include the scalar field, the model becomes richer. In fact, the first bracket in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralExplicitAction} is proportional to the kinetic terms of Eq.~\eqref{eq:calH} and can become negative without resorting to an imaginary parameter
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \left(-6 a \dot{a}^2 + a^3 \dot\phi^2\right) = - \frac{\pi_a^2}{12 a} + \frac{\pi_\phi^2}{2 a^3} = 3 a \left(1 - \frac{a^2 V(\phi)}{3}\right) \,.
\end{equation}

Below, we show an example in which we observe a classical transition from dS A to dS B in the potential of the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialExample}. The initial conditions are given by $a(0) = \sqrt{3/V_A}$, $\phi(0) = \phi_A = -0.01$, $\dot\phi(0) = 0.2$, so that the field goes over the barrier and start oscillating in the dS B minimum at $\phi_B = 0.01$, with decreasing amplitude. In the example, the maximum of the barrier is located at $\phi_{\rm max} \simeq -0.00375$ and the value of the potential is $V_{\rm max} \simeq 0.1068$. The initial speed necessary for the field to classically overcome the barrier and make the transition possible is roughly given by the height of the barrier $\Delta V = V_{\rm max} - V_A \simeq 0.0068$, so that $\frac{1}{2} \dot\phi^{2} \gtrsim \Delta V$. This is analogous to the recently proposed ‘fly-over’ scenario~\cite{Blanco-Pillado:2019xny} \footnote{We can equally get Hawking-Moss configurations after adjusting some of the parameters.}. Asymptotically, the dS B solution is recovered. In the example we used $V_A = 0.1$ and $V_B = 0.05$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:BracketTerms} we report the values of the brackets in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralExplicitAction}, showing that they change sign at the same time even though the parameter $s$ of the evolution is always kept real.

\item{\bf Non-standard classical paths}. 
The Hamiltonian and momentum constraints can be expressed as the standard FLRW equation:

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2+V(\phi)\right)-\frac{1}{a^2}\label{eq:hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

and the scalar field equation

\begin{equation}
\ddot\phi+3\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)\, \dot\phi + V'(\phi)=0\label{eq:scalarequation} 
\end{equation}

We want to explore if there are paths in the $\phi,a$ space that can connect the two sides of the barrier for a scalar potential with more than one minimum. A simple path can be starting with $a=$ constant. In this case the FLRW equation (Hamiltonian constraint) becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2+V(\phi)=\frac{3}{8\pi Ga^2}\equiv E
\end{equation}
which is the same as the  energy conservation equation for a particle of energy $E$. As long as $E>V$ the field passes through classically over the barrier with no need of tunneling. Note that this happens only for a closed universe. Note also that the scalar field equation is satisfied automatically as usual for energy conservation. This is Einstein's static universe solution. 

For non-static cases, the standard classical solution would correspond to an initial velocity $\dot\phi$ to be big enough so that the kinetic energy can overcome the difference in potential energies to cross the barrier.  In cosmological setting this would correspond to the standard scenarios such as Hawking-Moss and the fly-over of the previous bullet point. However considering trajectories in the  $a(t), \phi(t)$ space can be more general than this. Due to the negative signature of the superspace metric there is no need to climb the potential energy barrier but we can move in the 2d $(a, \phi)$ space. 

For this, note that in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hamiltonian} the curvature term adds a negative term to the scalar potential and therefore if the scale factor decreases with time the initial speed needed to cross the barrier is smaller than that required to compensate for the potential difference. This can also be seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:scalarequation} since for a contracting universe $H<0$  the ‘friction’  term $3H\dot\phi$ has the opposite sign, accelerating the field $\phi$ rather than slowing it down. This means that the classical path would have a contracting phase while the scalar field climbs through the barrier and then starts expanding after the transition. A sequence of contracting and expanding classical paths connecting different vacua would seem to be generic in a multi-minima scalar potential and could provide the basis of a novel scenario for early universe cosmology beyond old and new inflation. For a recent discussion of bouncing cosmologies see for instance~\cite{Gungor:2020fce}.



\subsubsection*{A toy model} 

To identify the classical path in a more concrete way let us consider the simplest square scalar potential.
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3,trim=3cm 12cm 0cm 5cm,clip]{SquarePotentialb.pdf}
\caption{Square potential.\label{fig:squarepotential}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
For a square potential as in the figure the second equation simplifies as $V'=0$. This can then be integrated to give:

\begin{equation}
\dot\phi=\frac{K}{a^3}
\end{equation}
with $K$ a constant that will be different for each of the regions $0<\phi<\phi_0$, $\phi_0<\phi<\phi_1$ and $\phi_1<\phi<\phi_2$.

Plugging this in the first equation (and setting $8\pi G=1$) we get:

\begin{equation}
\dot a= \pm\sqrt{\frac{K^2+2Va^6-6a^4}{6a^4}}
\end{equation}

Taking the ratio of these two equations we get:

\begin{equation}
\phi= \pm \sqrt{6}K\int \frac{da}{a\sqrt{K^2+2Va^6-6a^4}}\label{eq:phiintegral}
\end{equation}
where $V=V_F,V_M,V_T$ depending of the region as shown in the figure.

In principle this equation defines the path in the $\phi,a$ space. There will be  one expression like Eq.~\eqref{eq:phiintegral}  for each of the three regions with the integration constants and the values of the constants $K$ could be fixed by matching the solutions at the points $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$.

\subsubsection*{A numerical example}

Let us consider the scalar potential of Fig.~\ref{fig:PotentialExample} with different initial conditions. Taking $\phi(0) = \phi_A$, $a(0) = 6.5$ and $\dot\phi(0) = 0.1$, we find using the Friedmann equation that $\dot{a}(0) \simeq \pm 0.69$. Let us then consider a contracting universe as initial condition: $\dot{a}(0) \simeq -0.69$. In this case, we get the scale factor and field evolutions in Fig.~\ref{fig:NonStandardFieldEvolution} and Fig.~\ref{fig:EvolutionFieldSpace}. Note that this is a different scenario with respect to standard  paths through the barrier such as Hawking-Moss and  ‘fly-over’ decay, as the initial kinetic energy ($\frac{1}{2} \dot\phi^{2} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ in the present example) is smaller than the barrier height ($\Delta V \simeq 6.8 \times 10^{-3}$). This illustrates explicitly our claim that due to the non-positive nature of the superspace metric there are more configurations connecting  the two different vacua.

\section{Open or Closed Universe?}
\label{sec:OpenClosed}

As we have seen in the previous sections, following  a Lorentzian approach the spacetime geometry is established from the beginning. For simplicity and computational control we started with a closed universe and the end result is then also a closed universe with $k=1$ LFRW  metric\footnote{Note that this is also the starting point in the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin approaches towards defining the wave function of the universe. The fact that closed universes are finite whereas flat and open universes have infinite volume makes closed universes better suited to define the probabilities associated to wave functions.}:
\begin{equation}
ds^2= -dt^2+a^2(t) d\Omega_3^2
\end{equation} 
which differs clearly from the open universe conclusion of CDL. This metric is by construction Lorentzian and has the $O(4)$ symmetry corresponding to a closed universe with no need of any analytic continuation.
 For $a\propto \cosh(\lambda t)$ this corresponds to the $SO(4,1)$ invariant closed  dS universe in global coordinates. In this case the natural foliation corresponds to horizontal surfaces of constant time. 
 
Here it is important to remark that dS space allows open, flat and closed slicings, see Fig.~\ref{fig:slicings}. Therefore, geometrically all slicings are equally allowed. Which foliation is preferred depends on the coupling to matter. For instance slices of constant inflaton field would naturally determine the proper time slicing and fix the curvature of the expanding universe within the nucleated bubble. In CDL this fixes the open universe but only after analytic continuation for which the original $O(4)$ symmetry becomes $O(3,1)$ of the open slicing. In the Lorentzian mini-superspace approach that we have followed here, the original $O(4)$ symmetry remains and implies the closed slicing. Next we will see that this remains true beyond mini-superspace as in the FMP Hamiltonian approach to quantum transitions.

\caption{Penrose diagrams for dS space with slicing corresponding from left to right to closed, flat and open slicings, respectively. Notice that the horizontal closed universe slicing is global.\label{fig:slicings}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}





\subsection{Beyond mini-superspace}

We have seen that our Lorentzian treatment led naturally to a closed slicing of dS space contrary to the CDL arguments. However, this may be an artefact of using the mini-superspace approximation in which the metric is only a function of time and there is no concrete description of the emergence of a bubble. In the Euclidean approach, even though the original calculations are also in mini-superspace,  the presence of the bubble and its spacetime trajectory after tunneling  is obtained from the proposed analytic continuation. In the Lorentzian approach there  is at present no explicit formalism to describe the quantum transitions between different vacua of a  scalar field potential. However, in the thin wall approximation in which the relevant quantities are the vacuum energy of the two vacua, the Hamiltonian formalism developed by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski~\cite{Fischler:1990pk} can be used. In this case the spherically symmetric metric depends on both time and the radial coordinate. This allows us to describe the dynamics of the wall and its trajectory. Here  we recall the basics of this approach, which like the Lorentzian mini-superspace model, naturally implies a closed universe slicing of the spacetime as seen by an observer inside the bubble.

The spherically symmetric metric takes the form:
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-N_t^2(t,r)dt^2+L^2(t,r)(dr+N_r(t,r)dt)^2+R^2(t,r)d\Omega_2^2
\end{equation}
with $N_t,N_r$ the lapse and shift functions respectively and $d\Omega_2^2$ the line element for the 2-sphere. The system consists of two dS spaces with cosmological constants $\Lambda_I, \Lambda_O$ separated by a wall of tension $\sigma$  at $r=\hat r$. The bulk and boundary actions are the standard gravitational ones and the  matter action is given by the two cosmological constants, so the total action is:
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int_{\mathcal M} d^4x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{R}+\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int_{\partial \mathcal M} d^3y\sqrt{-h} K+S_M+S_W,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the extrinsic curvature of the wall and
\begin{eqnarray}
S_M &= & -4\pi  \int dt dr L N_t R^2\left(\Lambda_O\theta(r-\hat r)+ \Lambda_I \theta(\hat r-r) \right), \nonumber \\
S_W &= & -4\pi T\int dt dr \delta(r-\hat r)\left[N_t^2-L^2(N_r+\dot{\hat{r}})^2\right].
\end{eqnarray}
 In the above we defined $T\equiv 4\pi G\sigma$. Following the standard Dirac prescription for this Hamiltonian system, the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints can be found and the matching conditions at the wall lead to an equation for the wall trajectory of the form:
 \begin{equation}
 \dot{\hat{R}}^2+V=-1; \qquad V=-\frac{\hat{R}^2}{R_0^2},
 \label{rdot}
 \end{equation}
 where $\hat R=R(\hat r)$ and $R_0$ is the turning point:
 \begin{equation}
 R_0^2=\frac{4T^2}{\left[(H_O^2-H_I^2)^2+2T^2(H_O^2+H_I^2)+T^4 \right]}.
 \end{equation}
 With $H^2_{I,O}=8\pi G \Lambda_{I,O}/3$. The classical trajectory of the wall is then given by:
 \begin{equation}
 R(t)=R_0\cosh\frac{t}{R_0}
 \end{equation}
 The quantum probabilities are determined from the solutions of the WDW equation $\mathcal{H}\Psi=0$ with ${\mathcal P}$ the relative probability of the configuration of the two dS spaces and the wall compared to that for just one dS: 
 \begin{equation}
 {\mathcal P}({\rm dS}\rightarrow{\rm dS}/\rm{dS}\oplus W)=\frac{|\Psi({\rm dS}/\rm{dS}\oplus W)|^2}{|\Psi(\rm{dS})|^2}
\end{equation}
The detailed calculation using the WKB method including a discussion of the matching of the under-the-barrier wave function to that in the classical region is given in~\cite{deAlwis:2019dkc} and the result reproduces the standard exponential factor $e^{-B}$ with $B$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwallextr}. This provides yet another Lorentzian way to derive the same decay rate. But contrary to the mini-superspace approach, the presence of the wall and its classical trajectory after the transition is made quite explicit


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralWF}
\Psi = a e^{I} + b e^{- I} \,,
\end{equation}
where, given a configuration with action $S$, we have denoted the combination $iS = I$ and the action $S$ is evaluated on a classical solution. 
The total action away from the turning point (but still under the barrier) is

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:B1i}
I_{\rm tot} = \, \frac{\pi}{4H_{\rm I}^{2}}\left[1-\epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{-}) \frac{2}{\pi} \left(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\sqrt{1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} R_{\rm O}^{2}}\right)\right)\left(\frac{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}}{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}(1 - H_{\rm I}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2})}\right)^{3/2}\right] - \\  
- \frac{\pi}{4 H_{\rm O}^{2}} \left[1 - \epsilon(\hat R^{\prime}_{+}) \left(2 + \frac{2}{\pi} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\sqrt{1-H_{\rm O}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2}}\right)\right)\left(\frac{R_{\rm o}^{2}-\hat R^{2}}{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}(1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} R_{\rm o}^{2})}\right)^{3/2} \right] + \\ 
+ \frac{\hat R^{3}}{2 R_{\rm o}} \sqrt{R_{\rm o}^{2} - \hat R^{2}}  \left[\frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} + T^{2})}{\sqrt{1 - c_{-}^{2}\hat R^{2}}} - \frac{(H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2}-T^{2})}{\sqrt{1 - c_{+}^{2}\hat R^{2}}}\right] - \\
- \left[\frac{H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} + T^{2}}{4 T H_{\rm I}^{2}} - \frac{H_{\rm O}^{2} - H_{\rm I}^{2} - T^{2}}{4 T H_{\rm O}^{2}}\right] R_{\rm o} \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{\hat R}{R_{\rm o}}\right) \,.
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
\end{small}






The background action is obtained by setting $\hat{r}_{\pm}=0$ in the above expressions (corresponding to having the complete dS space with Hubble parameter $H_{\rm O}$), giving us
\begin{equation}
\overline{I} = -\frac{\pi}{2 G H_{\rm O}^{2}}\left[(1 - H_{\rm O}^{2} a_{\rm O}^{2})^{3/2} - 1 \right] \,,\label{eq:HHV}
\end{equation}
which gives the Hartle-Hawking (under the barrier) wave function when
substituted into Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} with $b=0$ and gives the Vilenkin version when $b=2ia$.


Now as pointed out in~\cite{Blau:1986cw}  when the background geometry is a black hole there are two classically allowed (I and III) and one classically forbidden regions (II) as in the usual tunneling problem in quantum mechanics, as discussed for instance in Sec.~\ref{sec:FlatSpace}. Classically, the wall expands (or contracts) up to a classical turning point and then re-collapses (or re-expands), but quantum mechanically it can tunnel under the barrier and resurface after the second turning point.  In the dS to dS case however there is no region I~\cite{Bachlechner:2016mtp,deAlwis:2019dkc} and the situation as discussed in more detail in~\cite{deAlwis:2019dkc} is similar to tunneling from ‘nothing’. In either case the WDW equation has two independent solutions as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} in each of these regions that need to be matched at the classical turning points. In the dS to dS case there is  just the one turning point, the coefficients $a$ and $b$ will determine the two coefficients in region III  through WKB matching conditions. In `tunneling from nothing' discussions one usually imposes an additional boundary condition, either the outgoing wave condition of  Vilenkin or the real wave function (coming from the so-called `no-boundary' condition') of Hartle and Hawking. However, if no such  condition is imposed, in general one of the two solutions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralWF} will dominate in each region, depending on the sign of the real part of   the action $I$. 

\noindent The ratio
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GeneralDefProbability}
\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \left|\frac{\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}}{\Psi_{\mathcal{B}}}\right|^2 \,,
\end{equation}
gives the probability of finding the system in the `nucleated' state $\mathcal{N}$ versus being in the `background' state $\mathcal{B}$, Notice that the two states $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ do not always have the meaning of `initial' and `final' states (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Introduction}): the transition can be clearly interpreted as happening in time if there is an initial classical motion of the bubble wall.  In the cases in which there is no initial classical motion of the wall the interpretation is less clear. For this reason we will refer to the state $\mathcal{B}$ as the `background' spacetime, instead of initial spacetime. Given that this is a  relative probability, it does not have to be smaller than one, and we avoid the problem of the normalisation of wave functionals.

The semi-classical wave function in the region III (i.e. the classical region where the brane spontaneously emerges from ‘nothing’) is obtained by analytically continuing the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:B1i}. The denominator in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GeneralDefProbability} corresponds to the emergence from ‘nothing’ of dS space with the `background' radius $H_O^{-1}$ and the relative probability is given by 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:Pout}
& \mathcal{P}_{{\rm {\rm out}}}(\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}) = \frac{|\Psi^{{\rm out}}_{{\cal N}}|^{2}}{|\Psi^{{\rm out}}_{{\cal B}}|^{2}} =  \\
& = \frac{|a+i\frac{b}{2}|^{2} e^{2 \text{Re}\left(I_{\rm out}(\hat{R})\right)} + |a-i\frac{b}{2}|^{2}e^{-2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(\hat{R})\right)}+2\text{Re}\left[(a+i\frac{b}{2})(a^{*}-i\frac{b^{*}}{2})\right]e^{2i\text{Im} \left(I_{\rm out}(\hat{R})\right)}}{|a+i\frac{b}{2}|^{2}e^{2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)} + |a-i\frac{b}{2}|^{2} e^{-2 \text{Re}\left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)} + 2 \text{Re}\left((a+i\frac{b}{2})(a^{*}-i\frac{b^{*}}{2})\right) e^{2i \text{Im} \left(I_{{\rm out}}(0)\right)}} \,.\nonumber
\end{align}.

As argued in~\cite{deAlwis:2019dkc}  the dominant contribution comes from the ratio of the first terms in the numerator and denominator and gives precisely the expression that was obtained by the generalisations of CDL~\cite{{Weinberg:2012pjx}} and by Brown and Teitelboim~\cite{Brown:1988kg}, namely the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwallextr}.
 
 However it is important to emphasise that even though the final  exponential term for the relative probability   is the same as that obtained by the Euclidean instanton/dilute-instanton-gas method the expression before minimising with respect to the wall radius i.e. Eq.~\eqref{eq:Bthinwall} is very different from the (analytic continuation of) expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:B1i}. This suggests that the Lorenzian continuation of the CDL or BT Euclidean argument is strictly speaking just the mini-superspace calculation of Sec.~\ref{sec:CDLfromWDW} whilst the next in order of complication - namely the spherically ($S_2$) symmetric Lorentzian calculation~\cite{deAlwis:2019dkc} based on~\cite{{Fischler:1990pk}} gives a completely different amplitude - even though the  exponential term is in agreement. Furthermore as pointed out in Sec.~\ref{sec:FlatSpace} even in the flat space case the direct WKB calculation gives a different pre-factor.
 
Finally, it is interesting to remark that in the Hamiltonian approach of~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk}, in order to  compare their results with the Euclidean approach of FGG~\cite{Farhi:1989yr}, they describe a canonical Euclideanisation of their approach by working on a static path and determine the relevant functions as $R,L$ in terms of the bubble location $\hat R$. Then they use $\hat R$ as the parameter that plays the role of Euclidean time in the Euclidean formalism. By doing this they successfully explain the Euclidean results of FGG in terms of a singular instanton that in the Hamiltonian approach corresponds to well behaved geometries. This Euclideanisation essentially corresponds to the standard $t\rightarrow it$ Wick rotation and does not correspond to the analytic continuations performed by CDL.

\subsection{Classical bubble trajectory  after nucleation}
Now we want to determine the Penrose diagram for the trajectory of the bubble after nucleation.

The equations of motion for the wall are given by the junction conditions which are obtained by embedding the wall coordinates in dS spacetime. Assuming rotational invariance  the metric of the wall is given by
\begin{equation}
ds^2_\Sigma=-d\tau^2+R^2(\tau)\, d\Omega^2 \,. \label{eq:wall_metric}
\end{equation}
We will first choose static coordinates for  dS, 
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-(1-H^2r^2)\, dt^2+\frac{dr^2}{1-H^2r^2}+r^2\, d\Omega_2^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $H^{-1}$ is the radius of dS. In these coordinates the wall radius is given by $r(\tau)=R(\tau)$. The junction conditions are 
\begin{equation}
(K^+)^{ i}_{\ j}-(K^-)^{ i}_{\ j}=-4\pi G \sigma\delta^{i}_{\ j} \,,
\end{equation}
where $K_{ij}^\pm$ is the extrinsic curvature at each side  and $\sigma$ is the tension of the wall. In order to compute the extrinsic curvature it is helpful to use Gaussian normal coordinates in which $K_{ab}$  takes the simple form
\begin{equation}
K_{ab} = - \Gamma^n_{ab} = - \frac{1}{2} \partial_n g_{ab} = -\frac{1}{2} n^\mu \partial_\mu g_{ab} \,,
\end{equation}
where $n^\mu$ denotes the unit vector orthogonal to the wall and $g_{ab}$ is the induced metric at the wall. The whole computation then boils down  to calculate the normal vector $n^\mu$ in an appropriate coordinate systems, from which we can compute the extrinsic curvature on the two sides of the wall and then enforce the junction conditions. To do so let us first denote the four-velocity of a point on the wall as $U^\mu$. In the static patch coordinate system, due to the spherical symmetry of the wall we have
\begin{equation}
U^\mu_S = \left(\dot{t}_{dS},\dot{R},0,0\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\dot{}$ denotes the derivative with respect to proper time. Note that the  normalisation of the four-velocity $g_{\mu \nu} U^\mu_S U^\nu_S = - 1$ implies the following relation between $\dot{t}_{dS}$ and $\dot{R}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TdRdS}
(1-H^2 R^2) \dot{t}_{dS}^2 = 1 +(1-H^2 R^2)^{-1} \dot{R}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
To compute the  normal vector to the wall  first notice that this is orthogonal to the four-velocity $U^\mu$, i.e. $g_{\mu \nu} n^\nu U^\mu_S = 0$. Using this  condition and that  $g_{\mu \nu} n^\mu n^\nu = 1$ implies

\begin{equation}
n^\mu = \left((1-H^2 R^2)^{-1} \dot{R}, \pm \sqrt{1-H^2 R^2 + \dot{R}^2},0,0\right) \,.
\end{equation}
One can now compute the junction condition. The $\theta$ component gives,
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{1-H_+^2 R^2+\dot R}-\sqrt{1-H_-^2 R^2+\dot R^2}=4\pi\sigma R \,,
\end{equation}
where the subscript $\pm$ indicates the side of the wall where we are evaluating.
After some manipulation this equation leads to Eq.~\eqref{rdot}, and so to a solution for the radius of the wall $R$. One also has the  $\tau$ component of the extrinsic curvature,\
$K_{\tau\tau}=U^{\mu}U^{\nu}\nabla_{\nu}n_{\mu}=-n_\mu U^{\nu}\nabla_\nu U^\mu $, which can be interpreted as the normal acceleration of the wall.  This implies that the trajectory followed by the  wall is not a geodesic unless $K_{\tau\tau}$ vanishes. This can be  evaluated in the static patch coordinates,
\begin{equation}
K_{\tau\tau}=-\frac{\ddot R-H^2 R}{\sqrt{1-H^2 R^2+\dot R^2}}=-\frac{\sqrt{1-H ^2R_0^2}}{R_0} \,, \label{eq:normalcurvature}
\end{equation}
where in the last step we have used Eq.~\eqref{rdot}. This last equation implies that the normal acceleration is a non-vanishing constant (since $R_0H<1$).
\subsection*{Global slicing\footnote{This part follows the last part of appendix C of~\cite{Blau:1986cw}.}}
We will now embed the wall in global coordinates, which are described in Eq.~\eqref{foliation:global}. The metric is given by
\begin{equation}
 ds^2=\frac{1}{H^2\cos^2T}\, \left(-dT^2+d\rho^2+\sin^2\rho d\Omega^2 \,, \label{eq:globalconformal}
\right)
\end{equation}
where $T$ is conformal time that varies from $-\pi/2$ at $\mathscr{I}_-$ to  $\pi/2$ at $\mathscr{I}_+$.  Embedding the wall metric in Eq.~\eqref{eq:wall_metric} into the global coordinates implies that $T(\tau)$ and $R(\tau)=H^{-1}\sec T(\tau)\sin\rho(\tau)$.  Also, plugging this back into Eq.~\eqref{eq:globalconformal} we have,
\begin{equation}
-\dot T^2+\dot\rho^2=-H^2\cos^2 T \,,
\end{equation}
where dots are derivatives with respect to proper time. Using this relation we find
\begin{equation}
\dot T^2=\frac{H^2\cos ^2T}{1-\rho'^2},~~\dot {\rho}^2=\frac{H^2\cos ^2T}{1-\rho'^2}\rho '^2 \,, \label{eq:tdot}
\end{equation}
with $\rho'\equiv d\rho/d T$. To describe the trajectories of the wall in  global coordinates we would like to find an expression for  $\rho(T)$.  Let us start by noticing that
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot R&=&\frac{1}{H} \frac{d T}{d\tau}\left(\tan T\sec T \sin\rho+\sec T\cos\rho \rho' \right)\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\tan T\sin\rho+\cos\rho\rho'}{\sqrt{1-\rho'^2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sin^2{\rho}}{H^2R_0^2\cos^2T}-1} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have  used Eq.~\eqref{eq:tdot} and in the last step Eq.~\eqref{rdot}. The last equality is a first order non-linear differential equation which determines the wall trajectory in conformal coordinates. The solution turns out to be remarkably simple: $\cos(\rho)=\sqrt{1-H^2R_0^2}\cos T \label{eq:sol1}$ as the reader may easily verify. 

In practice it turns out that to obtain this solution it is more convenient to use Eq.~\eqref{eq:normalcurvature}. This is straightforward since it  is also possible to write  $\ddot R$,  in terms of $\rho$, $T$ and derivatives of $\rho$ with respect to $T$.  After substituting into Eq.~\eqref{eq:normalcurvature} we get \footnote{Alternatively we can use that  is possible to write $K_{\tau\tau}=-\frac{\dot\beta}{\dot R}$, with $$\beta\equiv\sqrt{1-H^2R^2+\dot R^2}=\frac{\cos\rho+\sin\rho\tan T\rho'}{\sqrt{1-\rho'^2}}\,.$$},
\begin{equation}
K_{\tau\tau}=-\frac{\cos (T) \rho''-\sin (T)\rho'^3+\sin (T) \rho'}{\left(1-\rho'^2\right)^{3/2}}H \,,
\end{equation}
given that $K_{\tau\tau}$ is constant this is a   second order ODE for $\rho$ as a function of $T$. 
Furthermore this expression does not depend explicitly on $\rho$ and  can be easily integrated if we rewrite it as,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt{1-H ^2R_0^2}}{H R_0}=\cos^2 (T)\frac{d}{dT}\left(\frac{ \sec T \rho'}{\sqrt{1-\rho'^2}}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
which leads to

\begin{equation}
\rho'=\pm\frac{\sqrt{1-H^2R_0^2}\sin(T)}{\sqrt{H^2R_0^2+(1-H^2R_0^2)\sin ^2(T)}}\,,\label{eq:rho'}
\end{equation}
where to fix one integration constant we have imposed $\rho'=0$ at $T=0$, which comes from Eq.~\eqref{rdot}.
We will keep the positive signs as it means that the wall speed increases. Notice  that  $\rho'<1$ and that at $\mathscr{I}_+$, $\rho'=\sqrt{1-H^2R_0^2}<1$. This expression can be integrated to obtain
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\quad \cos(\rho)=\sqrt{1-H^2R_0^2}\, \cos T \quad} \label{eq:sol1}
\end{equation}
where we have used that at $T=0$, $R_0=\cos(\rho(0))$. Eq.~\eqref{eq:sol1} determines the trajectory of the wall in global coordinates. Now let us analyse this expression, first
note that this the trajectory never crosses the light cone $\rho=T$ since $T<\arccos(\sqrt{1-HR_0^2}\cos T)=\rho$.    Also note that   all trajectories end at $\rho=\pi/2$, since   at $T=\pi/2$, $\cos\rho=0$. Moreover the world sheet of the trajectory is a time-like  hyperboloid having $SO(3,1)$ invariance. To see this we can substitute Eq.~\eqref{eq:sol1} into the equations for the embedding of global dS from Eq.~\eqref{foliation:global}.
Hence the equation for the brane world volume in embedding coordinates is,

\begin{eqnarray}
X_0&=& H^{-1}\tan T,\nonumber \\
 X_1&=&H^{-1} \frac {\cos\rho}{\cos T}=H^{-1}\sqrt{1-H^2R_0^2},\nonumber \\
X_2^2+X_3^2+X_4^2&=&R^2=\frac{\sin^2{\rho}}{H^2\cos^2 T} =   \frac{1}{H^2\cos^2T}-\frac{1-H^2R_0^2}{H^2}.
\end{eqnarray}

Hence we have the equation for the world sheet of the brane,

 \begin{equation}
-X_0^2+X_2^2+X_3^2+X_4^2=R_0^2.
\end{equation}\label{eq:braneworld}


This is the equation of a hyperboloid with  $SO(3,1)$ symmetry\footnote{In fact one could have guessed the solution simply by demanding that $X_1$ is a constant since that is the simplest choice for the embedding given that $R^2$ cannot be set to a constant, and then fixing the constant from the fact that at $T=0=X_0$, $R=R_0$.}, in other words it is 3 dimensional dS space with radius $R_0$   and  corresponds to the Lorentzian rotation of Coleman's~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} Euclidean bounce solution.

In summary we have explicitly found a closed expression for the classical trajectory of the wall after nucleation given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:sol1}. It corresponds to an $SO(3,1)$ symmetric  hyperboloid. The speed is determined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho'} which even though it increases it never reaches the speed of light ($|\rho'|<1$). However it can easily be seen that if gravity is decoupled ($G\rightarrow 0$) the turning point goes as $R_0\rightarrow 3\sigma/(\Lambda_O-\Lambda_I)$ but $H\rightarrow 0$ and then $\rho'\rightarrow 1$ reproducing the flat space results~\cite{Aguirre:2008wy}. In general, the limiting speed differs from the speed of light by a small amount of order $M^2/M_P^2$ with $M$ the reference scale of the scalar field potential. Finally, from the Penrose diagram it can be seen that the trajectory is such that a signal from the centre of the bubble cannot reach the wall but in principle radiation from the wall can reach the observer at the centre.

\subsection{Cosmological implications}

Let us now compare the cosmological differences between CDL and a closed universe after the tunneling transition. This revives the old question regarding the spatial curvature of the universe. After inflation this issue is considered less urgent since whatever the original curvature is, a short period of inflation is enough to render the universe essentially flat. However at least as a question of principle, especially concerning  the question of whether the universe is infinite or finite  and also potential observational effects, it is still relevant to address these differences. See for instance references~\cite{Efstathiou:2003hk,Aghanim:2018eyx,DiValentino:2019qzk,Handley:2019tkm, Efstathiou:2020wem, DiValentino:2020hov} for a recent debate regarding current observations.

\subsection*{Initial conditions and Inflation}
Vacuum decay offers a unique physical mechanism to provide the initial conditions for the evolution of the universe. The initial conditions for the classical cosmological evolution are the configurations of $\phi(t)$ and $a(t)$ right after tunnelling that we will define as  $t=0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Open Universe\footnote{See~\cite{Gott:1982zf,Ratra:1994vw,Bucher:1994gb,Linde:1999wv,Freivogel:2005vv,Bousso:2013uia,Freivogel:2014hca,Bousso:2014jca} for related discussions.}.}
The Lorentzian equations of motion after CDL tunneling  are those for an open $k=-1$ LFRW model with the standard cosmological evolution for a scalar field with canonical kinetic terms and potential $V(\phi)$,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2 & =&\frac{8\pi G}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2+V(\phi)\right)+\frac{1}{a^2} \,, \\
0&=&\ddot{\phi}+3H\dot\phi  +V_{,\phi} \,. \nonumber
\label{eqn:fieldinflation}
\end{eqnarray}
Initial conditions consistent with the smoothness of the CDL instanton are 
\begin{equation}
\dot\phi(0)=\phi(0)=0 \,, \qquad  a(t)=t +{\mathcal O(t^3)} \,.\nonumber
\end{equation}
 Here $a(0)=0$ is a coordinate singularity. It is clear from Eqs. \eqref{eqn:fieldinflation} that $\dot a$ could not be chosen to vanish at $t=0$  for positive potentials. We can see that initially the dynamics is dominated by the curvature term $1/a^2$. The friction ($3H$) diverges at $t\to 0$, and then the initial $\dot\phi$ does not increase by much. 
 
From Eq.~\eqref{eqn:fieldinflation} we obtain the
 $\dot H$ equation for $k=-1$:
 \begin{equation}
 \dot H= \frac{\ddot a}{ a} -\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2=-4\pi G \dot\phi^2 -\frac{1}{a^2} < 0 \,,
 \label{acceleration}
 \end{equation}
 which guarantees in general that there is no local minimum value for $a(t)$ ($\dot a=0 \implies \ddot a<0$) and that there should be at least one point for which $a=0$ (the coordinate singularity).
 
 After a critical time of order $t^*\sim (\alpha V)^{-1/2}$ with $\alpha^{-1}=3/8\pi G=3M_p^2$, the potential  starts to dominate, and the curvature term becomes less important as the universe expands.  This could mark the onset of inflation as long as the slow roll conditions are satisfied.

There are some conditions on the potential in order to achieve this scenario. In particular, it is required to have that $V''/V>1$ to be able to have a solution that satisfies the instanton boundary conditions~\cite{Jensen:1983ac} (see fig.\ref{fig:potential}). This being the opposite of the slow-roll condition, there has to be a curvature change in the scalar potential to eventually give rise to inflation.

We may be more quantitative and follow the scale factor $a(t)$ and $\phi(t)$ for times smaller than $t^*$. In this case we can expand around the initial points
$V(\phi(0)+\delta\phi) \sim \Lambda+ \beta\delta\phi $ with $\beta=V'(\phi(0)) $ and find
\begin{equation}
a(t)=\frac{\sinh (\lambda t)}{\lambda} \,, \qquad \lambda^2=\alpha\Lambda=\frac{\Lambda}{3M_p^2} \,,
\end{equation}
and the scalar field:
\begin{equation}
\phi(t)=\frac{\beta}{3\lambda^2}\left[\frac{\cosh(\lambda t)-1}{\cosh(\lambda t)+1}+ \log\left(\frac{\cosh(\lambda t)+1}{2}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
From here we can explicitly verify that for the domain of validity of this regime ($t\leq t^*$) the scale factor starts at zero and then increases linearly with time whereas the scalar field increases as  $\phi(t)\lesssim \beta t^2$. For $t>t^*\equiv 1/\sqrt{\lambda}$,  $\Lambda$ dominates as long as $\beta$ is small enough ($\beta<\Lambda/M_p$) such that $\Lambda$ dominates over both $\beta\phi$ and $\dot\phi^2$. In that case the universe starts a standard inflationary period, otherwise the field rolls fast and depending on the potential there may or may not be a standard period of inflation.

\caption{The scalar field potential has a false vacuum at $\phi_f$ and an inflationary region on the right of $\phi_T$. In the standard CDL picture the field tunnels from $\phi_a$ to $\phi_b$.\label{fig:potential}}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}


 \item {\bf Closed Universe}. 
In the closed universe after tunneling the equations are \footnote{For relatively recent discussions on the cosmology of closed universes see for instance~\cite{White:1995qm, Ellis:2001ym, Linde:2003hc, Uzan:2003nk, Lasenby:2003ur, Masso:2006gv, Bonga:2016iuf, Ratra:2017ezv}.}:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2 & =&\frac{8\pi G}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2+V(\phi)\right)-\frac{1}{a^2} \,,\\
0&=&\ddot{\phi}+3H\dot\phi  +V_{,\phi} \,. \nonumber
\label{eqn:fieldcosmology}
\end{eqnarray}
 The negative sign in the first equation due to the positive curvature ($k=1$) changes the picture substantially. First note that the initial conditions can be fixed by imposing that at the turning point  $\pi_a,\pi_\phi=0$. This implies that the right hand side of the Friedmann equation above vanishes and the the natural initial conditions can be (making a convenient choice for $\phi(0)$)\footnote{There are  more general initial conditions for  $G_{MN}\pi^N\pi^M\neq 0$ where $G^{MN}$ is the non-positive metric in superspace. As we have described before (see Sec.~\ref{sec:ThinWallApproximation}) when this is the case there also classical solutions that go from the false to the true vacua.  In this case,  the field oscillates around the true minima for a finite time until it reaches the points where $\dot\phi=\dot a=0$ that could be used as initial conditions for the rest of the evolution of the universe.}
 
\begin{equation}
\dot\phi(0)=\phi(0)=0\,, \qquad  \dot a(0)=0\,. 
\label{initial}
\end{equation}

Contrary to the open case, there is no curvature dominated period since the curvature term has at best  to balance the energy density term in order to have $(\dot a/a)^2\geq 0$. In particular at $t=0$ we have $a(0)=3/(8\pi G V(0))\neq 0$. Different from the open universe case, the scale factor does not vanish.

Also, the equation for $\dot H$ now reads:
\begin{equation}
 \dot H=\frac{\ddot a}{ a} -\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2=-4\pi G \dot\phi^2 +\frac{1}{a^2} \,,
 \label{acceleration2}
 \end{equation}
which, unlike the open and flat cases, can be positive or negative depending on the relative size of the kinetic terms and the curvature. Note that a positive curvature adds a positive contribution to the equation for $\dot H$. This means in particular that even though the universe is closed it does not necessarily recollapse~\cite{Barrow:1988xi}.

Repeating the quantitative analysis as for the open case, assuming the energy density is dominated by $\Lambda$, we find:
\begin{equation}
a(t)=\frac{\cosh (\lambda t)}{\lambda} \,, \qquad \lambda^2=\alpha\Lambda=\frac{\Lambda}{3M_p^2} \,.
\end{equation}
Contrary to the open case the scale factor {\it does not} vanish at any point and after nucleation it starts with a minimum value of order $a(0)\geq a_{min}\sim M_p/\sqrt{\Lambda} $ which is large enough to be in the  regime for which the classical evolution equations are valid. The scalar field evolves as:
\begin{equation}
\phi(t)=-\frac{\beta}{3\lambda^2}\left[\log\cosh(\lambda t)-{\rm sech}^2(\lambda t)+1\right] \,.
\end{equation}
Now the Hubble parameter is $H=\dot a/a=\lambda \tanh(\lambda t)$, and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\ddot a}{a}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\left(\Lambda-\dot\phi^2\right) \,, \qquad  -\frac{\dot H}{H^2}=-{\rm csch}^2(\lambda t) \,.
\end{equation}
Unlike the open case there is no critical time  before which the curvature term dominates over the $\Lambda$ contribution in the Friedmann equation. But in order to have the potential energy to be dominated by $\Lambda$ we need $\beta\phi<\Lambda$ which happens for times $t<t^*\left(\Lambda/\beta M_p\right)^2$ and for having the kinetic energy suppressed with respect to the potential energy $\dot\phi^2\ll \Lambda$ which happens for times $t<t^*\left(\Lambda/\beta M_p\right)^2$ after that the universe stops accelerating. Both of these conditions are satisfied if $\beta\ll\Lambda/M_p$ which is the equivalent of slow-roll condition.

So we have two different possible outcomes after nucleation depending on the value of $\beta$: a short period of relative fast roll and a few e-foldings before the standard slow-roll inflation or an inflationary period right after nucleation if $\beta\ll\Lambda/M_p $. The maximum number of e-foldings from this period would be:
\begin{equation}
N_{max}= \int_0^{t_c} H dt=\log \cosh\left(\frac{t_c}{t^*}\right)\sim \frac{t_c}{t^*}\sim\frac{2}{\epsilon} \,,\qquad t_c=t^*\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\beta M_p}\right)^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Where $\epsilon=M_P^2V_{,\phi}^2/2V^2\simeq M_P^2\beta^2/2\Lambda^2< 1$ is the usual slow roll parameter. This is the maximum number of e-foldings since  at $t=0$ the nucleation happens at the minimum value of $a(t)$ by imposing $\dot a(0)=0$, implying $a(0)=a_{min}=1/\lambda$~\cite{Ellis:2001ym}. Unlike the flat and open cases in which the initial value of $a$ at the start of inflation can be as small as possible, i.e. as small as the Planck scale $l_P$, in the closed case the existence of  a lower bound for $a$ with $a_{min}$ much bigger than the Planck length implies a a much stronger upper bound in the number of e-folds in order to fit with the present value  size of the observable universe $a_0$ which could be estimated if $\delta=|\Omega -1|=1/a_0H_0 $ is measured: $N_{max}\leq \ln{a_0/a_{min}}$. Note that this is independent of the standard argument for $N\sim 60$ setting bounds on $\Omega$ today which if measured with enough precision  may differentiate between open or closed universes.
 
 
 \subsection*{Density Perturbations}
 
The magnitude of density perturbations measured by  $\delta\rho/\rho\sim H^2/\dot\phi $ grows from zero at $t=0$ to order $\delta\rho/\rho\sim \lambda^3/\beta $ close to $t=t_c$ which can be smaller or larger than standard slow-roll inflation depending on the values of $\beta$ and  $\Lambda$\footnote{Note that in the open universe case,  this quantity diverges at $t=0$ since $H$ diverges and $\dot\phi(0)=0$ there, and then increases with time.}. 

If $\beta$ does not satisfy the slow-roll condition then $N=\int_0^{t^*} H dt=\log \cosh 1\sim 1$. Therefore it is clear that in this case the scalar potential will need to flatten up through an inflection point in order to have an adequate period of inflation afterwards.

In both cases (slow or fast roll after bubble nuecleation) the fact is that $k=1$ not only provides initial conditions for inflation but also contributes to the density perturbations since in general the presence of curvature provides  a new scale. It affects the power spectrum in the sense that  the long wavelength modes which exit the horizon during the early stages of inflation may carry imprints of the spatial curvature, whereas the short wavelength modes which exit the horizon later are not affected by the spatial curvature. 

This can also be seen if we compute the power spectrum for the inflationary perturbations. As it is well known the scalar field during inflation produces an adiabatic power spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations. Whereas for flat universes the power spectrum is nearly scale invariant, this is not the case for  open and closed universes. As the long wavelength modes leave the horizon carrying the imprint of the curvature they deviate from scale invariance at  large scales. For small curvature $\Omega_k=k/(a_0H_0) <1$ the power spectrum can be written as \footnote{A more appropriate treatment of the power spectrum after tunneling needs to take into account the fluctuations of the wall. In the case of open inflation these translate into an excited initial state which also imply deviations from scale invariance~\cite{Bucher:1994gb}. For the  closed universe solution obtained in Sec.~\ref{sec:CDLfromWDW} we leave the analysis of the inflationary  perturbations for future work.}~\cite{Cheung:2007st,Creminelli:2013cga},
\begin{equation}
P(q)=A_s q^{(n_s-1)-3}\left(1-\frac{19}{8}\frac{k}{q^2}\right)+\mathcal{O}(\Omega_k^2)) \,,
\label{eq:inflpowerspectrum}
\end{equation}
where $A_s$ is the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations   and $q$ is the comoving wavenumber. We have also neglected self interactions of the curvature perturbation. From Eq.~\eqref{eq:inflpowerspectrum} we can read that at large scales, or smaller $q$ , the power spectrum is suppressed for a closed universe ($k=+1$), but is enhanced for the same scales for an open universe.  


 These deviations from scale invariance can have an effect on the CMB. At large scales the main contribution to the angular power spectrum $C_l$ is given by the Sachs-Wolfe effect\footnote{ For a derivation of the effect of the primordial power spectrum over Sachs-Wolfe effect see formula (2.6.19 ) of~\cite{Weinberg:2008zzc}}
\begin{equation}
l(l+1)C_l=\frac{4\pi}{25}A_s\left(1-\frac{19}{8}\frac{kr_L^2}{3(l-1)(l+2)}\right) \,.\label{eq:Cls}
\end{equation}
Where $r_L$ is the radial coordinate of the surface of last scattering. Then we see that at linear order in the curvature there is a suppression/enhancement of the low $l$ modes of the temperature anisotropy of the CMB depending on the sign of $k$.

Note that this  computation  assumes that the only contribution from the curvature comes from inflation and, although this is  not quite accurate, it works as a qualitative  approximation. Another  point is that the effect  described is model independent but, as we mentioned  before, there are other signatures that depend on each model that may have important consequences. For example for the case of open inflation after CDL,  there is a fast roll phase before slow roll, by which  the authors of~\cite{Freivogel:2005vv,Bousso:2013uia} have argued that because of an  anthropic bound on the duration of inflation the fast roll phase translates into a potentially observable suppression of the low $l$ modes of the CMB. This  implies that a negatively curved universe can have an effect which is  indistinguishable from  a positively curved universe, so in  order to break this degeneracy it might be necessary to study higher order correlation functions of cosmological observables. 

At small scales it can be seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:inflpowerspectrum} that the power spectra coincide. This means that the CMB  power spectrum at large angles or small multipoles is suppressed with respect to the standard flat $\Lambda$ CDM model. Since the effect  through inflation is only  present at large scales, the power spectrum coincides with the flat case for large multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 30$). This  is the regime that has been tested most successfully, although recently several articles have found some evidence for the closed universe inflationary model from the latest CMB observations~\cite{DiValentino:2019qzk,Handley:2019tkm,Efstathiou:2020wem}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Observational Implications and the String Landscape}

The implications of a closed universe after bubble nucleation may have important observational implications and would radically affect the dynamics of the string landscape. Let us list some of them.


\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf General Prediction}. Due to the  richness of the string landscape, it has been a serious challenge to identify concrete and general predictions that could be tested with the potential to rule out the landscape paradigm. The standard belief that bubble nucleation after vacuum decay gives rise only to an open universe, has been identified as the most concrete general prediction that could be subject to experimental test at some point. However, if the outcome is a closed universe, the prediction would be exactly the opposite. At the moment we cannot rule out the possibility that an open universe could also be allowed. Furthermore note that, in principle, the idea behind the landscape is that universes are continuously produced from a series of quantum tunneling among the many different vacua. If a parent universe is closed and a daughter universe is open, this chain of universe creation would not be possible. However if both parent and daughter universes are closed this is natural. Furthermore as emphasized before in this work, the string theory landscape is a result of brane nucleation rather than a CDL like process, and should be treated as in FMP.


\item{\bf Bubble collisions}. In the landscape picture, the continuous creation of inflationary bubbles may give rise to the possibility of bubble collisions that may have left some imprint in the CMB, gravitational waves, etc. See for instance~\cite{Kleban:2011pg, Aguirre:2009ug} for an overview. One important aspect of the treatment of bubble collisions is the symmetry after the collision. Assuming open universes, each bubble spatial section has an $SO(3,1)$ symmetry which breaks to $SO(2,1)$ after the collision. Numerical relativity techniques have been developed during the past few years to address this problem (see for instance~\cite{Johnson:2015gma} and references therein). If the universe is closed the situation differs substantially, the finiteness of the volume of spatial sections affects the probability of collisions and the natural symmetry breaking would be from the $SO(4)$ symmetry of the corresponding three-spheres to $SO(3)$. This should modify the description of  bubble collisions. A detailed discussion of this interesting effect lies beyond the scope of this article.

\item{\bf Beyond bubbles and CDL}. The natural outcome of a phase transition, such as vacuum decay, is through the nucleation of bubbles of the new vacuum. Bubbles are required if the universe has infinite volume as in flat and open spacetimes. If the spacetime is closed there is the possibility that the full space and not only a region within it  can change to the new vacuum with non-vanishing probability since the volume is finite.  Note also that, as we have seen in the previous section, the fact that in mini-superspace the kinetic energy for the scale factor is negative whereas that for the scalar field is positive (Eq.~\eqref{eq:calH}), then the Hamiltonian constraint ${\cal H}=0$ allows to pass classically through the barrier of the scalar potential. This does not appear without gravity nor in the Euclidean approach nor in the Hartle-Hawking case without scalar fields. This would then be the leading contribution to the ratio of probabilities for the creation of each of the two dS spaces. Even though these conclusions may be artefacts of the mini-superspace approximation they would affect the structure of the landscape and deserve further study.

\item{\bf Number of e-folds}. For the open universe case,  reference~\cite{Freivogel:2005vv}  extracted a lower bound on the number of e-foldes during inflation $N>59.5$ similar to the observed bound $N>62$ (modulo logarithmic corrections due to the different epochs of matter/radiation domination after inflation). For $k=1$ as we discussed before, there is an {\it upper} bound on the number of e-folds (again with $\Delta N\sim 2$ e-folds with respect with the observed one)~\cite{Uzan:2003nk}. The reason being, as mentioned above, that for the closed universe, there is a minimum value of the scale factor $a_{min}\sim M_p/\sqrt{\Lambda}$ that already starts large (contrary to the flat and open cases in which $a\sim 0$ before inflation and have in principle no limit on the maximum number of e-folds before reproducing the standard cosmology after inflation). This tends to favour concave models of inflation and disfavour models, such as chaotic inflation, that may have an essentially unlimited number of e-folds.

 
\item{\bf Power suppression}. As we have seen, both open and closed universes introduce a new cosmological scale, the curvature, and affect the density perturbations observed from the CMB. The net effect is  a suppression of the power  spectrum at large angles or small multipoles. This effect may have two different origins, one due to the curvature and the other if there is a period of fast rolling before inflation.



\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusions}

We have presented here an extension of the standard quantum mechanics WKB approximation to field theory and gravity. Expanding on previous approaches we developed a general geometric formalism to extend the WKB to wave functions in Wheeler's superspace and found explicit expressions for vacuum transition probabilities interpreted as ratios of the square of wave functions of the two different configurations for both field theory and gravity. 

In field theory we presented explicitly two different cases with two vacua. The first is the standard scalar potential with two minima at finite field value and the second one with the second minimum corresponding to a runaway. In both cases we reproduce the standard Coleman results at leading order. In the second case we  found the (potential) bound states and corresponding resonances to provide the explicit expression for the decay rate Eq.~\eqref{eq:lifetime} which agrees with the Euclidean approach at leading order but differs in the pre-factor. We further emphasised our approach is the natural generalisation of the standard quantum mechanical WKB calculation and does not have subtle issues such as the  handling of negative modes and trusting the dilute instanton approximation.

 In the gravity case, our results can be summarised in two directions. In one way they confirm the results obtained by Euclidean methods. In particular we provide a Lorentzian perspective for the estimation and interpretation of the decay rates and the wall trajectory after tunneling, illustrating the validity of the Euclidean techniques at least as far as getting the leading exponential behavior goes. On the other hand we point out that there are substantial differences from the Euclidean approach. In particular for the mini-superspace case we found that:
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Selecting a very particular path we can reproduce exactly the decay rate as computed by CDL, however the interpretation of this path is not at all clear.
 
 \item The natural transition rate gives simply the ratio of the two corresponding Hartle-Hawking wave functions, without a tension term as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HHV} which gives dominant decay rate as compared to CDL. It seems then that this mini-superspace approach is actually a generalisation of Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin/Linde transitions than to CDL.
 
 \item The fact that the metric in superspace is not positive definite, as manifested for instance in the Hamiltonian constraint Eq.~\eqref{eq:calH}, allows for classical paths to connect the two dS vacua without the need to pass through or across the barrier. This will not have an exponentially suppressed decay rate but it depends on the initial conditions.
 
 \item The natural dS foliation corresponds to the global slicing which leads to a closed universe as in Hartle-Hawking/Vilenkin-Linde unlike the open universe claimed by CDL. Here, recall that the driving argument was based on the analytic continuation triggered by the argument of the scalar field. Surfaces of constant $\phi$ would give rise to the hyperbolic foliation of spacetime. However, as noted already in~\cite{Coleman:1980aw} in the extreme thin-wall approximation we only have two values of the cosmological constant and there is no preferred dS space foliation. This means that already in the Euclidean framework described for instance in~\cite{Brown:1988kg} horizontal slices of dS could have been chosen for the regions inside and outside the bubble with a closed universe.
 
 \item In mini-superspace there is no way to discuss bubble nucleation and therefore the transition should be interpreted between two entire dS spaces. This computation really makes sense only for $k=1$  since the spatial volume in global slicing is finite. A full description beyond mini-superspace is needed in order to properly include the bubble. 
In the Hamiltonian approach to quantum tunneling developed in~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk} it is clear that the geometry inside and outside the bubble is also of a closed universe~\cite{deAlwis:2019dkc}. In this approach  the metric depends not only on time but also on the radial coordinate $r$. This reinforces our conclusion. This formalism only compares the transition between two different cosmological constants without considering a scalar field with the corresponding potential. This corresponds to the extreme thin-wall approximation or brane nucleation in string theory. A full Hamiltonian approach including the scalar field dynamics is not yet available.

\item Our approach and that of~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk}  started with a spherically symmetric geometry that was natural  to describe the bubble after the transition but in principle we could have chosen a flat or negatively curved spacetime to start with. The fact that these spaces have infinite volume renders  the volume integrals problematic. For instance in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Sg} the $2\pi^2$ factors come from integrating the volume of the three-sphere  which in the flat and open cases would diverge. This would require a proper volume regularisation before extracting physical information. Similar volume integrals for closed slicings appear in the approach of~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk}. Furthermore, in~\cite{Fischler:1989se,Fischler:1990pk} a prescription is provided to Euclideanise their results, the corresponding analytic continuation is simply $t\rightarrow it$ which is not the analytic continuation proposed by CDL. 

\item We believe that  the possibility that the geometry of the bubble after nucleation corresponds to a closed FLRW universe, contrary to CDL,  should be  seriously considered. Indeed this is the natural implication of brane nucleation in string theory as we have argued in this paper. This may have important physical implications if our universe is described in terms of a bubble after vacuum transitions as discussed at the end of the previous section. Besides the deep implications of having a finite against an infinite universe, with finite number of stars and galaxies, it may eventually be tested if there is a definite way of determining the curvature of the universe. For the string theory landscape, it will at least eliminate the standard claim that detecting a closed universe would rule out the multiverse. These are important cosmological questions that deserve further scrutiny.

\section{Asymptotics of the Whittaker \texorpdfstring{$W$}{W} function\label{app:asymptotics}}

The purpose of this appendix is to understand the asymptotics of the Whittaker function, which describes the enhanced gauge field modes.

For parameters $k$, $m$, and $b$, and a positive real variable $x$, the Whittaker functions 
\[
C_{1}W_{k,m}(bx)+C_{2}M_{\kappa,\mu}(bx)
\]
 for constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ provide the general solution to the differential equation 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}w(x)+\left(-\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{kb}{x}+\frac{\tfrac{1}{4}-m^{2}}{x^{2}}\right)w(x)=0.
\]
 In general, given any differential equation of the form 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}w(x)+\left(A+\frac{B}{x}+\frac{C}{x^{2}}\right)w(x)=0,
\]
 it is obviously possible to solve for (possibly complex) Whittaker function parameters $k$, $m$ and $b$ which match general parameters $A$, $B$, and $C$. For our purposes, it will be convenient to make the transformation $k\mapsto-i\kappa$, $m\mapsto-i\mu$ and $b\mapsto-i\beta$. Under the assumption that $\kappa$, $\mu$ and $\beta$ are real and positive, it will be sufficient for our purposes to take $C_{2}=0$ and consider only the ``negative-imaginary Whittaker $W$ function'' 
\[
C_{1}W_{-i\kappa,-i\mu}(-i\beta x),
\]
 which solves 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}w(x)+\left(\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{\kappa\beta}{x}+\frac{\tfrac{1}{4}+\mu^{2}}{x^{2}}\right)w(x)=0.\label{eq:whiteqn}
\end{equation}
 The case of \prettyref{eq:+2mode} for $w_{+2}^{(e)}$ with the $c_{2}$-solution corresponds to the negative-imaginary Whittaker $W$ function with parameters
\begin{align}
\kappa & =(1+c_{2})\xi\approx2\xi,\label{eq:whitparams}\\
\mu & =\sqrt{2c_{2}-(2\xi)^{-2}}\xi\approx\sqrt{2}\xi,\nonumber \\
\beta & =2.\nonumber 
\end{align}


\subsection{Summary of asymptotics}

The phenomenology in Sections \ref{sec:linearized} and \ref{sec:example} depends strongly on the behavior of the mode functions both in the infinite future $x\to0^{+}$ and around the global maximum. We summarize here the corresponding estimates for the Whittaker function. Derivations are given in the subsequent subsections.

We impose the boundary condition 
\begin{align}
w(x) & =C_{1}W_{-i\kappa,-i\mu}(-i\beta x)\sim e^{i\beta x/2}\textrm{ as }x\to\infty\label{eq:whittaker-with-coeff}
\end{align}
 which, with our normalization conventions for mode functions, corresponds to the Bunch--Davies vacuum \prettyref{eq:BDsimple}. We show in \prettyref{subsec:asymp-normalization} that 
\[
C_{1}=e^{\kappa\pi/2}e^{i\phi_{0}},
\]
 where the phase $\phi_{0}$ is undetermined. 

In \prettyref{subsec:asymp-x-0} we study the resulting behavior as $x\to0^{+}$. As is the case in \prettyref{eq:whitparams}, if $\kappa>\mu$ then upon taking $\phi_{0}$ as in \prettyref{eq:phi-0}, the real part is enhanced and the imaginary part is suppressed. Specifically, 
\begin{align}
\textrm{Re}(w(x)) & \approx2e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta x}{2\mu}}\cos\left(\mu\ln(\beta x)+\theta_{0}\right),\label{eq:wh-re}\\
\textrm{Im}(w(x)) & \approx\tfrac{1}{2}e^{-(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta x}{2\mu}}\sin\left(\mu\ln(\beta x)+\theta_{0}\right).\label{eq:wh-im}
\end{align}
 Note that this is a wave which decays in proportion to $\sqrt{x}$. Furthermore, this wave oscillates $\mu/(2\pi)$ times per e-fold. In our case of interest $w(x)=w_{+2}^{(e)}(x)$, e-folds in $x$ are equivalent to e-folds in $\tau$, and the frequency is $\approx\sqrt{2}\xi/(2\pi)$ oscillations per e-fold. 

While for large $\xi$, we could approximate $\kappa$ and $\mu$ to obtain 
\begin{align}
w_{+2}^{(e)}(x) & \approx2^{-1/4}\sqrt{x}\left(2e^{(2-\sqrt{2})\pi\xi}\cos\theta+\tfrac{1}{2}e^{-(2-\sqrt{2})\pi\xi}i\sin\theta\right),\label{eq:as_wp2}\\
\theta & \approx\sqrt{2}\xi\ln(2x)+\theta_{0},\nonumber 
\end{align}
 it is far more accurate to use \prettyref{eq:wh-re} rather than \prettyref{eq:as_wp2} due to the exponential sensitivity on $\kappa$ and $\mu$. 

Finally in \prettyref{subsec:Airy-Whittaker}, we apply the WKB approximation as reviewed in \prettyref{subsec:WKB-review} and \prettyref{subsec:WKB-formulas} to obtain \prettyref{eq:airy-full-approx}, which accurately approximates $\textrm{Re}(w(x))$ around its maximum value in terms of the Airy function.

\subsection{\label{subsec:asymp-normalization}Asymptotics as \texorpdfstring{$x\to\infty$}{x\to\infty}}

Here we determine the magnitude $\left|C_{1}\right|$ of the coefficient in \prettyref{eq:whittaker-with-coeff} by matching the Bunch--Davies vacuum with the asymptotics of the Whittaker function. 

Let $x$ be a positive real variable. For large $x$, the Whittaker function satisfies 
\begin{align*}
W_{k,m}(bx) & =e^{-bx/2}(bx)^{\kappa}\left(1+\epsilon_{1}(bx)\right),\\
\epsilon_{1}(bx) & =0+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1+k^{2}+m^{2}}{bx}\right).
\end{align*}
 This asymptotic expression remains valid upon replacing $k\mapsto-i\kappa$, $m\mapsto-i\mu$ and $b\mapsto-i\beta$, and evaluating complex exponents $a^{p}=e^{p\ln a}$ using the principal branch of the logarithm. Thus 
\begin{align}
W_{-i\kappa,-i\mu}(-i\beta x) & =e^{i\beta x/2}(-i\beta x)^{-i\kappa}\left(1+\epsilon_{1}(\beta x)\right)\nonumber \\
 & =e^{-\kappa\pi/2}\,e^{i\beta x/2-i\kappa\ln(\beta x)}\left(1+\epsilon_{1}(\beta x)\right)\label{eq:log-drift}
\end{align}
 as $x\to\infty$. Therefore $\left|C_{1}\right|=e^{\kappa\pi/2}$. Note the (inconsequential) logarithmic drift in complex phase, which prevents us at this stage from selecting a distinguished phase.

\subsection{\label{subsec:asymp-x-0}Asymptotics as \texorpdfstring{$x\to0^+$}{x\to0+}}

Let us now consider the behavior as $x\to0^{+}$, corresponding to the infinite future. In this limit we have 
\begin{align*}
W_{-i\kappa,-i\mu}(-i\beta x) & =\sqrt{\beta x}e^{-i\pi/4}\sum_{\pm}\frac{\Gamma\left(\mp2i\mu\right)}{\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+i\kappa\mp i\mu\right)}(-i\beta x)^{\pm i\mu}\left(1+\epsilon_{2}(\beta x)\right),\\
\epsilon_{2}(\beta x) & =0+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1+\kappa+\mu}{1+\mu}\beta x\right).
\end{align*}
 To make sense of this expression, we may rewrite it in the form 
\begin{align}
w(x)\equiv e^{\kappa\pi/2}e^{i\phi_{0}}W_{-i\kappa,-i\mu}(-i\beta x) & =C_{0}\sqrt{\beta x}\left(\lambda\cos\theta+i\lambda^{-1}\sin\theta+\epsilon_{3}(\beta x)\right),\label{eq:w-exact}\\
\theta & \equiv\mu\ln(\beta x)+\theta_{0},
\end{align}
 where the four constants $C_{0}$, $\lambda$, $\phi_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ depend only on the parameters $\kappa$ and $\mu$. After some algebra, we find the exact expressions
\begin{align}
C_{0} & \equiv(2\mu)^{-1/2},\label{eq:whit-consts}\\
\lambda & \equiv e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+e^{-2(\kappa-\mu)\pi}}+\sqrt{1+e^{-2(\kappa-\mu)\pi}e^{-4\mu\pi}}}{\sqrt{1-e^{-4\mu\pi}}}\right),\label{eq:whit-lambda}\\
\theta_{0} & \equiv\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\phi_{\Gamma,1/2}(\kappa+\mu)-\phi_{\Gamma,1/2}(\kappa-\mu)\right)-\phi_{\Gamma,0}(2\mu)\\
\phi_{0} & \equiv\tfrac{\pi}{4}+\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\phi_{\Gamma,1/2}(\kappa+\mu)+\phi_{\Gamma,1/2}(\kappa-\mu)\right),\label{eq:phi-0}\\
\phi_{\Gamma,a}(b) & \equiv\arg\Gamma(a+ib).\\
\epsilon_{3}(\beta x) & =0+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1+\kappa+\mu}{1+\mu}(\lambda+\lambda^{-1})\beta x\right).
\end{align}
 To derive these parameters, we have made use of the following polar decomposition identities for the gamma function. For $b\in\mathbb{R}$, 
\[
\Gamma\left(ib\right)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{b\sinh(\pi b)}}e^{i\phi_{\Gamma,0}(b)},\quad\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+ib\right)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\cosh(\pi b)}}e^{i\phi_{\Gamma,1/2}(b)}.
\]

In the parameter range of interest (see \prettyref{eq:whitparams}), 
\[
\kappa\approx2\xi,\qquad\mu\approx\sqrt{2}\xi,\qquad\beta=2,\qquad\xi\geq2,
\]
 we have $e^{-2\pi(\kappa-\mu)}\ll1$ and $e^{-4\pi\mu}\ll1$. This allows us to very accurately approximate the part of the expression for $\lambda$ inside the parentheses in \prettyref{eq:whit-lambda} by the number $2$. Specifically, 
\begin{align}
\lambda & =2e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\left(1+\epsilon_{4}\right),\label{eq:l-approx}\\
\textrm{with }\ 0 & <\epsilon_{4}\leq e^{-2(\kappa-\mu)\pi}+e^{-4\mu\pi}\textrm{ when }\mu\geq\tfrac{1}{25}.
\end{align}
 In the worst case with our parameters (when $\xi=2$), the relative error is only $\epsilon_{4}\approx3\times10^{-4}$. 

Finally, when $e^{-2\pi(\kappa-\mu)}\ll1$ and $e^{-4\pi\mu}\ll1$ we obtain the formulas \prettyref{eq:wh-re} and \prettyref{eq:wh-im} by plugging \prettyref{eq:l-approx} into \prettyref{eq:w-exact}.

\subsection{WKB approximation }

\subsubsection{Review of WKB approximation\label{subsec:WKB-review}}

Although widely known, we briefly summarize the technique of WKB approximation as utilized here. The solutions to a differential equation of the form 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}w(x)=V(x)w(x)\label{eq:WKB-orig}
\end{equation}
 are often not straightforward when $V(x)$ is a general function. Important exceptions are when $V(x)$ is one of the following model potentials $V_{0}(x)$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $V_{0}(x)=1$ then $w_{0}(x)=e^{\pm x}$ are solutions. 
\item If $V_{0}(x)=-1$ then $w_{0}(x)=e^{\pm ix}$ are solutions. 
\item If $V_{0}(x)=x$ then the Airy functions $w_{0}(x)=\mathrm{Ai}(x)$ and $w_{0}(x)=\mathrm{Bi}(x)$ are solutions. 
\item If $V_{0}(x)=\pm\left(x^{2}-\alpha^{2}\right)$ for some constant $\alpha$ then the solutions are called parabolic cylinder functions, and they have $\alpha$ as a parameter. 
\end{itemize}
The main idea of the WKB approximation is to perform a change of variables to make \prettyref{eq:WKB-orig} resemble such a model equation. We consider transformations of \prettyref{eq:WKB-orig} which do not introduce a first-derivative term, and are of the form 
\begin{align}
w(x) & \mapsto\vartheta(\zeta(x))\cdot W(\zeta(x)),\label{eq:liouville}
\end{align}
 where $\zeta(x)$ is an increasing change of variables ($\mathrm{d}\zeta/\mathrm{d}x>0$), and $\vartheta(\zeta)$ is constructed to eliminate any first-derivative term introduced by $\zeta$. Such a transformation is called a Liouville transformation. The transformed equation should be of the form 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\zeta^{2}}W(\zeta)=\left(V_{0}(\zeta)+\epsilon(\zeta)\right)W(\zeta),\label{eq:WKB-transformed}
\end{equation}
 where $V_{0}(\zeta)$ is a model potential, $\epsilon(\zeta)$ is arranged to be suitably negligible. The Liouville transformation condition that ensures no first-derivative term is equivalent to 
\begin{equation}
\vartheta(\zeta)=\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}\zeta}\right)^{1/2}.\label{eq:WKB-mult}
\end{equation}
A generally good choice of $\zeta(x)$ to keep $\epsilon(\zeta)$ small is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\zeta}{\mathrm{d}x}=+\sqrt{\frac{V(x)}{V_{0}(\zeta)}}.\label{eq:zeta-def}
\end{equation}
Since this must be real, it must satisfy $\mathrm{sign}(V(x))=\mathrm{sign}(V_{0}(\zeta))$. Thus for each zero of $V(x)$ in the domain of interest, there must be a corresponding zero in $V_{0}(\zeta)$. In this way, the number of roots of $V(x)$ determines the appropriate type of model potential.

Solving \prettyref{eq:zeta-def} gives 
\[
Z(\zeta)=X(x),\ \textrm{where}\ Z(\zeta)\equiv\int\sqrt{\left|V_{0}(\zeta)\right|}\ \mathrm{d}\zeta\ \textrm{ and }\ X(x)\equiv\int\sqrt{\left|V(x)\right|}\ \mathrm{d}x.
\]
In case there are any roots $\left\{ x_{i}\right\} $ of $V(x)$, then the constant of integration and any parameters of the model potential $V(x)$ must be chosen so that $X(x_{i})=Z(\zeta_{i})$, where $\left\{ \zeta_{i}\right\} $ are the corresponding zeroes of $V_{0}(\zeta)$.  Assuming that we can compute the antiderivatives $Z$ and $X$, as well as $Z^{-1}$, we have the formula 
\[
\zeta(x)=Z^{-1}\left(X(x)\right).
\]
 Working backward to get our approximate solution, let $W_{0}(\zeta)$ denote a solution to \prettyref{eq:WKB-transformed} where we ignore\footnote{For detailed error estimates for the WKB approximation, see \cite{olver1997}.} $\epsilon(\zeta)$. Plugging this into \prettyref{eq:liouville} and using \prettyref{eq:WKB-mult} and \prettyref{eq:zeta-def}, we find that 
\begin{equation}
w_{\textrm{approx}}(x)=C\left(\frac{V_{0}(\zeta(x))}{V(x)}\right)^{1/4}W_{0}(\zeta(x))\label{eq:WKB}
\end{equation}
 is an approximate solution to \prettyref{eq:WKB-orig} for any number $C$.

\subsubsection{\label{subsec:WKB-formulas}WKB approximation for various model potentials}

Consider first the simple case where $V(x)$ has no zeroes so that we can take $V_{0}(\zeta)=\pm1=\mathrm{sign}V$. The model solutions are $W_{0}(\zeta)=e^{\pm\sqrt{\mathrm{sign}V}\zeta}$. For the reparameterization, $Z(\zeta)=\zeta$ and so 
\[
\zeta_{\textrm{exp}}(x)=X(x)=\int\sqrt{\left|V(x)\right|}\,\mathrm{d}x.
\]
 Finally, 
\begin{equation}
w_{\textrm{exp-approx}}(x)=C\left|V(x)\right|^{-1/4}e^{\pm\sqrt{\mathrm{sign}V}X(x)},\label{eq:exp-approx}
\end{equation}
 which is the standard WKB approximation. 

Consider next the case where $V(x)$ has a single simple zero at $x=x_{1}$ in the domain of interest. We take $V_{0}(\zeta)=\zeta$. Thus $Z(\zeta)=\mathrm{sign(\zeta)}\tfrac{2}{3}\left|\zeta\right|^{3/2}$, and $X(x)=\int_{x_{1}}^{x}\sqrt{\left|V(y)\right|}\,\mathrm{d}y$, so 
\begin{align}
\zeta_{\textrm{Airy}}(x) & =\mathrm{sign}(x-x_{1})\left|\tfrac{3}{2}X(x)\right|^{2/3},\\
w_{\textrm{Airy-approx}}(x) & =C\left(\frac{\zeta(x)}{V(x)}\right)^{1/4}\mathrm{Ai}\left(\zeta(x)\right).\label{eq:airy-approx}
\end{align}

The case where $V(x)$ has two zeroes at $x_{1}<x_{2}$ is treated in~\cite{Olver137} and applied to the imaginary Whittaker function in~\cite{Olver_1980}. As a summary, the parameter $\alpha$ of $V_{0}$ is determined by $\int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha}\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-\zeta^{2}}=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\sqrt{\left|V(y)\right|}\,\mathrm{d}y$, which is necessary for $\zeta(x_{1})=-\alpha$ and $\zeta(x_{2})=+\alpha$. One complication is that although $Z(\zeta)$ has a closed form, its inverse function does not. Furthermore the parabolic cylinder functions are considerably more complicated. Since our region of interest is around the global maximum, which occurs close to the zero\footnote{A slight discrepancy between $x_{1}$ and $x_{\mathrm{min}}$ arises because our $-V(x)$ differs slightly from the mass term $m_{+2}^{2}$ of \prettyref{eq:mass-term-2p}, as explained in \prettyref{fn:modified-potential}. } $x_{1}\approx x_{\mathrm{min}}$ defined in \prettyref{eq:def-xmin-xmax}, the Airy approximation \eqref{eq:airy-approx} suffices for our purposes. 

\subsubsection{\label{subsec:Airy-Whittaker}Airy approximation of the imaginary Whittaker \texorpdfstring{$W$}{W} function around its maximum }

We wish to find the constant coefficient of \prettyref{eq:airy-approx} which will make it agree with $\textrm{Re}(w(x))$ from \prettyref{eq:wh-re} as $x\to0$, or equivalently as $\zeta\to-\infty$. 

In the imaginary Whittaker equation \prettyref{eq:whiteqn} we take\footnote{\label{fn:modified-potential}Since the WKB approximation introduces small errors, there is potential for these errors to cancel. For the Whittaker function, it is advantageous to take $V(x)$ without the $\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-2}$ term in \prettyref{eq:whiteqn}. This is equivalent to using a non-zero error term $\epsilon(x)=\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-2}$, as in \prettyref{eq:WKB-transformed}. (See \cite{olver1997} for details.) As motivation for this modification, consider $\epsilon(x)=ax^{-2}$, so that the remainder is $V(x)\approx-(\tfrac{1}{4}-a+\mu^{2})x^{-2}$ as $x\to0$. Therefore $X(x)\approx\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{4}-a+\mu^{2}}\ln x$. When $V(x)$ is large, the Airy approximation reduces to the exponential approximation, and thus by \prettyref{eq:exp-approx} the approximate solution is of the form 
\[
w_{\mathrm{approx}}(x)\approx C\sqrt{x}e^{\pm i\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{4}-a+\mu^{2}}\ln x}.
\]
 By comparison of the exponent with \prettyref{eq:wh-re}, we see that the coefficient of $\ln x$ should be $\mu$, so it is better to take $a=\tfrac{1}{4}$ rather than $a=0$. } 
\begin{align*}
V(x) & =-\left(\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{\kappa\beta}{x}+\frac{\tfrac{0}{4}+\mu^{2}}{x^{2}}\right),
\end{align*}

To determine the proper coefficient $C$ of \prettyref{eq:airy-approx}, we substitute into \prettyref{eq:airy-approx} the asymptotic formula 
\[
\mathrm{Ai}(\zeta)=\pi^{-1/2}(-\zeta)^{-1/4}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{2}{3}(-\zeta)^{3/2}\right)+O(-\zeta^{-1})\textrm{ as }\zeta\to-\infty
\]
 to obtain 
\[
w_{\textrm{approx}}(x)\approx C\pi^{-1/2}V(x)^{-1/4}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-X(x)\right).
\]
 As $x\to0$ we have $V(x)^{-1/4}\approx\sqrt{x/\mu}$. Matching the magnitude with \prettyref{eq:wh-re}, we find $C=\sqrt{2\pi\beta}\ e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}$, so 
\begin{equation}
w_{\textrm{approx}}(x)=\sqrt{2\pi\beta}\ e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}\left(\frac{\zeta(x)}{V(x)}\right)^{1/4}\mathrm{Ai}\left(\zeta(x)\right).\label{eq:airy-full-approx}
\end{equation}
 The exact expression for $\zeta(x)$ is complicated, but it is well-approximated for $x\approx x_{1}$ by 
\[
\zeta(x)\approx\left(2\mu^{2}-\beta\kappa x_{1}\right)^{1/3}\ln\frac{x}{x_{1}}.
\]
 To give the exact formula for $\zeta(x)$ in the interval $\left(0,x_{1}\right)$ in a concise form, we introduce 
\begin{align*}
\chi\equiv\frac{\beta x}{2\mu},\quad\lambda & \equiv\frac{\kappa}{\mu}>1,\quad\chi_{i}\equiv\lambda+(-1)^{i}\sqrt{\lambda^{2}-1}\textrm{ for }i\in\left\{ 1,2\right\} ,\\
R & \equiv\sqrt{\chi^{2}-2\chi\lambda+1}=\frac{x}{\mu}\sqrt{-V(x)}.
\end{align*}
 It is easy to verify that 
\begin{align*}
x_{i} & =2\mu\chi_{i}/\beta\textrm{ for }i\in\left\{ 1,2\right\} ,\\
V(x) & =V(x)=-\left(\frac{\beta}{2\chi}\right)^{2}\left(\chi^{2}-2\chi\lambda+1\right)=-\left(\frac{\beta}{2\chi}\right)^{2}\left(\chi-\chi_{1}\right)\left(\chi-\chi_{2}\right),\\
X(x) & =\left(R-\ln\left(1-\chi\lambda+R\right)-\lambda\ln\left(\lambda-\chi-R\right)+\ln\chi+\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\lambda)\ln\left(\lambda^{2}-1\right)\right)\mu,\\
\zeta(x) & =\mathrm{sign}(x-x_{1})\left|\tfrac{3}{2}X(x)\right|^{2/3}.
\end{align*}
 Due to the limited domain of the logarithm, the expression given for $X(x)$ applies only in the interval $(0,x_{1})$. 

We use \prettyref{eq:airy-full-approx} to compute the gauge-field contribution to the scalar power spectrum in \prettyref{app:variance_computation}.

\subsection{Coupled gauge field - inflaton background \label{subsec:dynamical_background}}

Previously in this section, we took $\xi$ to be a constant, external parameter in the equation of motion for the homogeneous gauge field background. We now turn to the complete dynamical background evolution, including also the evolution of the homogeneous inflaton field $\phi(\tau)$ and hence the (slow) evolution of $\xi$. This leads to the coupled system of equations
\begin{align}
f^{\prime\prime}(\tau)+2e^{2}f^{3}(\tau)-e\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda}\,\phi^{\prime}f^{2}(\tau)\,\  & =0 \,, \label{eq:fbackground2} \\
\phi''(\tau)+2aH\phi'(\tau)+a^{2}V_{,\phi}(\phi)+\frac{3\alpha e}{\Lambda a^{2}}f^{2}(\tau)f'(\tau) & =0 \,.
\label{eq:phibackground}
\end{align}
In single-field slow-roll inflation, $\xi$ typically increases over the course of inflation. This slowly evolving value of $\xi$ slightly modifies some of the results of the previous subsections (e.g.\ the precise values for the range of phases which lead to the $c_2$-solution in Fig.~\ref{fig:u0-of-xi} may be shifted), but the overall picture remains valid. After inserting the $c_2$-solution, Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground}  can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\dot \phi}{H} + \frac{V_{,\phi}}{V} +\frac{ \alpha}{e^2 \Lambda} H^2 (c_2 \, \xi)^3 = 0\,,
 \label{eq:phibackground2}
\end{equation}
where we have neglected the slow-roll suppressed term $\ddot \phi$. Assuming that the last term is sub-dominant, $\dot \phi/H$, $V_{,\phi}/V$ and $\xi$ are all proportional to $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$, with $\varepsilon = \dot \phi^2/(2 H^2) \simeq (V'/V)^2/2$ denoting the first slow-roll parameter. Moreover, for a quadratic or cosine potential as is usually considered in axion inflation models, $H^2$ is proportional to $1/\varepsilon$.  In summary, the time-dependence of all terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground} is governed by the square root of the first slow-roll parameter. In particular, if the last term is sub-dominant at any point in time (after the $c_2$-solution has been reached), it will always remain sub-dominant. For the parameter example of Sec.~\ref{sec:example}, we find precisely this situation.

We note that this is a different regime than the `magnetic drift' regime studied in Refs.~\cite{Adshead:2012kp,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka}. There, the friction term was taken to be large compared to the Hubble friction, $\xi \alpha H/(e \Lambda)  \gg 1$. Also in this regime, there is a local attractor for the gauge field background which scales as $f(\tau) \sim 1/\tau$, with however a different constant of proportionality. Within the non-abelian regime, the difference in our results with respect to these earlier works on CNI, in particular concerning the stability of the scalar sector, can be traced back to the fact that we do not restrict our analysis to this magnetic drift regime.

Axion-like particles are one of the most natural candidates to drive cosmic inflation since their perturbative shift-symmetry protects the flatness of their potential against quantum corrections. These pseudoscalar fields typically couple to the gauge fields present in the theory through a Chern-Simons term in the Lagrangian. As reviewed in Sec.~\ref{sec:review}, in models of axion-inflation, such a coupling can lead to several interesting and possibly observable phenomenological features. In particular, the production of chiral gravitational waves is a peculiar signature of these models that could be observed in the near future in experiments like the ground-based interferometer LIGO or the space-mission LISA. Hence, it is extremely interesting to continue exploring the rich phenomenology provided by these inflationary models. In this paper we showed that if the axion-inflaton is non-minimally coupled to gravity, these models of axion-inflation represent a natural framework for the production of PBH dark matter. In particular, in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-minimal} we worked out the main generic features of an axion-inflation model with non-minimal coupling to gravity, deriving both the background dynamics and the perturbation power spectra. As explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}, the interplay between the two main features of this model, i.e. the coupling to gauge fields and the non-minimal coupling to gravity, makes the generation of a broad peak in the scalar spectrum possible. In particular, the increase of the spectrum is sourced by the instability caused by the coupling between the inflaton and the gauge fields. If the kinetic function $K(\phi)$ (see Eq.~\ref{non_minimal:einstein_frame}), corresponding to a non-minimal coupling to gravity in the Jordan frame, features a rapid increase after the advent of this instability, a subsequent suppression of the spectrum arises, generating a peak as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2}. The position of the peak is determined by the choice of $K(\phi)$ and by the ratio $\alpha/\Lambda$ (see Eq.~\ref{non_minimal:einstein_frame}), which parametrizes the strength of the inflaton coupling to gauge fields. In this context, an interesting class of models is given by the \textit{attractors at strong coupling}, defined in Eq.~\eqref{attractors:model_def}. As shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs}, by choosing the kinetic function $K(\phi)$ in such a way that the previously mentioned condition is met (see Eq.~\eqref{attractors:inv_definition}), PBHs produced with this mechanism can account for a sizeable fraction of the dark matter present in the universe in a wide region of the parameter space. As explained in the main text, if we ignore the disputable bounds based on neutron star capture, PBHs can even account for the totality of dark matter, in the mass range $10^{18}$~g $\, - \, 10^{24}$~g. Heavier PBHs with masses around a solar mass, although accounting only for a fraction of dark matter, may in turn lead to observable GW signals in LIGO.

The inflationary model employed and the PBH production mechanism proposed in this paper can be further developed following several complementary directions. For instance, they should be embedded in a consistent cosmological scenario, which includes the reheating of the Standard Model degrees of freedom. Since the inflaton is coupled to gauge fields, (p)reheating would primarily produce these massless vector fields~\cite{Adshead:2015pva}. If the number of gauge fields $\mathcal{N}$ is larger than one\footnote{Or if $\mathcal{N}=1$ but the related gauge field is not the Standard Model hypercharge.}, this could lead to a tension with the constraints on the amount of dark radiation present in the universe at the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and of recombination~\cite{Ade:2015xua} if the gauge fields remain massless. Hence, the inclusion of the Standard Model degrees of freedom and of the (p)reheating should be consistent with these bounds. A detailed study of the (p)reheating process could also provide interesting clues for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe, possibly sourced by the CP-violating axion-gauge field coupling~\cite{Kusenko:2014uta,Anber:2015yca,Adshead:2015jza}.

The high sensitivity of inflation to quantum corrections makes it crucial to embed any effective model into an UV complete theory. As remarked in App.~\ref{app:axions}, string theory contains all the ingredients necessary for the realization of an explicit embedding of the PBH production mechanism described in this paper: inflaton-dependent non-canonical kinetic terms for the axion-inflaton, a potential that supports axion-inflation and a coupling between the axion-inflaton and topological terms of Abelian gauge theories. The realization of an explicit string theory construction is beyond the scope of this paper, and we leave it for future work.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs} we have only reported a few benchmark models in order to show that the mechanism is well-suited for the production of PBHs. It would be interesting to perform a systematic analysis in order to understand which choices of the scalar potential and of the non-minimal coupling to gravity lead to the production of PBHs that compose a sizable fraction of the dark matter present in the universe - or vice versa how to reconstruct these fundamental ingredients of the theory for a given PBH distribution.

Finally, it would be interesting to extend this inflationary model to the case in which the axion-inflaton is coupled to non-Abelian gauge fields, and to study how the PBH production would be modified in such a setup.

\section{Introduction}

Ever since the first superstring revolution, there has been constant progress in the area of string phenomenology~\cite{Ibanez:2012zz, Quevedo:2016tbh}. Based on our current understanding of string theory, the picture of the string landscape with a large number of vacua that can accommodate our universe  (with a positive cosmological constant) has emerged~\cite{Douglas:2006es}. As our understanding of string theory improves and new computational techniques are developed, we should be able to establish the existence of these vacua more and more rigorously and make contact with phenomenology. At the same time, a number of criteria to determine which effective field theories can be consistently embedded into a theory of quantum gravity have been proposed and are called the \textit{swampland conjectures}~\cite{Vafa:2005ui, Ooguri:2006in, Ooguri:2016pdq, Brennan:2017rbf}.  

Effective field theories that can be consistently embedded in string theory are part of the string landscape, as opposed  to  those in the swampland which are not consistent with quantum gravity. The typical example is the swampland conjecture about the boundary of moduli spaces:  any effective field theory is valid only within an ${O}(M_{\rm p})$ field range in field space, since new light states appear in the spectrum of the theory as one moves farther away \cite{Ooguri:2006in}. Recently, a new swampland criterion has been proposed \cite{Obied:2018sgi} which is in contradiction with the picture of a large number of (possibly dS) vacua in the string landscape and inflationary models. The conjecture states that everywhere in field space the full quantum scalar potential $V$ obeys the relation:
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm p}\,\frac{\left|\nabla V\right|}{V} \gtrsim c \,,
\label{eq:SwamplandConjecture}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is an ${O}(1)$ positive constant. It is important to examine whether such a criterion can be consistent with phenomenology. The criterion (\ref{eq:SwamplandConjecture}) has many strong implications for cosmology \cite{Agrawal:2018own, Andriot:2018wzk, Colgain:2018wgk}. In particular it implies that at present we are necessarily in an epoch of quintessence. The tight bounds on fifth-forces \cite{Adelberger:2003zx} and the time variation of fundamental constants \cite{Martins:2017yxk}, provide strong constraints on the couplings of the quintessence field. Furthermore, in the context of $N=1$ supergravity it seems very hard to be able to decouple a quintessence field from the Standard Model. Finally, depending on the model, naturalness considerations require fine-tuning of the quintessence potential at the functional level\footnote{A similar problem has been discussed in the context of attempts to explain time variation of coupling constants in terms of a time varying field \cite{Banks:2001qc}.}, or at least one additional tuning compared to dS models. This makes explicit constructions of quintessence models from string compactifications very challenging.

This conjecture is the most recent of a series of articles claiming potential problems with the standard approach to obtain a landscape of metastable dS string vacua as initiated by the KKLT seminal paper \cite{Kachru:2003aw} and followed-up by many other developments that have improved the robustness of the original and other related scenarios. The challenges vary from points of principle (e.g. how to properly define an S-matrix and a quantum theory in general in dS space \cite{Witten:2001kn, Banks:2012hx, Maltz:2016iaw}) to details about each of the different steps of the KKLT scenario \cite{Sethi:2017phn, Bena:2009xk, Moritz:2017xto} which seem to make it natural to explore alternatives to dS. The main purpose of the first part of this article is to assess the pros and cons of the different approaches to dS compactifications. This is important in order to have a clear idea of the assumptions used and the continuous progress but also the open challenges. We will argue that dS models reached a good level of concreteness and calculational control which has been improving over time and provide interesting phenomenological applications to cosmology and particle physics. Moreover we shall stress that some of the computational challenges apply also to 4D $N=1$ supersymmetric vacua which, above all, do not seem to be promising starting points for phenomenology. We will also point out that, even if dS string models are not characterised by expansion parameters which can be made parametrically small, these parameters can still be small enough to trust the phenomenological implications of these constructions.

In the second part of the paper we first discuss the theoretical consistency of quintessence models pointing out that in general, in the absence of a symmetry principle, their construction is more challenging that dS models since one needs to perform two fine-tunings to get the correct energy scale and mass of the quintessence field. We then use a more phenomenological approach to assess to which extent quintessence is a viable alternative to dS from observations. In particular, we found (as recently shown also in \cite{Denef:2018etk}), that if the quintessence picture is valid, and there is no other scalar field around other than the Higgs, in order to satisfy the swampland conjecture \eqref{eq:SwamplandConjecture}, the Higgs field has to couple directly to the quintessence field. This would be particularly challenging in any string theory/supergravity scenario, as a quintessence field that couples directly to the Higgs would also couple to the SM fermions, violating fifth-force constraints. We explore these issues, providing examples that avoid the direct coupling of the Higgs to quintessence even if they seem very hard to realise in a supergravity setup.

The paper is organised as follows. Sec. \ref{sec:dSstrings} is devoted to the discussion of dS models from string theory. After briefly recalling the need for dS in Sec. \ref{WhydS}, we provide a review of pros and cons of type IIB string models to achieve dS vacua in Sec. \ref{sec:ProsCons}. We then turn to a more detailed analysis of various advantages and criticisms of dS vacua from anti-branes in Sec. \ref{Dbar} and from T-branes in Sec. \ref{T}, while Sec. \ref{OtherdS} contains short comments on other existing string mechanisms to achieve dS vacua. After that, we turn to quintessence in Sec. \ref{sec:QuintessenceStrings}. In particular we discuss various general challenges for quintessence model building in Sec. \ref{sec:QuintessenceChallenges} and the constraints on the coupling between the Higgs and the quintessence field due to the swampland conjecture in Sec. \ref{sec:SwampandHiggs}. We then 
 review the quintessence models already present in the literature in Sec. \ref{sec:StringQuintessenceModels} and finally we study the r\^ole that ultra-light axions can play to explain dark energy data in Sec. \ref{sec:LowRedshift}.


\section{De Sitter in string theory}
\label{sec:dSstrings}

\subsection{Why dS?}
\label{WhydS}

Present observations suggest that the current energy density of dark energy is $\rho_0 \sim 10^{-120}\,M_{\rm p}^4$ and that it is consistent with a positive cosmological constant. A concrete way to quantify this is through the equation of state parameter $w=p/\rho$ which naturally hints towards an asymptotic dS vacuum or something very close to it as recently reported by the Planck collaboration \cite{Aghanim:2018eyx}:
\begin{equation}
w_0=-1.028\pm 0.032\,.
\end{equation}
If dark energy is described by the vacuum energy, we need a scalar potential $V$ whose size today is of order $\langle V\rangle_0 \sim \rho_0\sim \Lambda^4 \sim ({\rm meV})^4$. Other possibilities involve quintessence models where the vacuum energy might be exactly zero (for example due to some yet to be found symmetry arguments) or negative, while at present the quintessence field is slow-rolling at positive energies. However recent low-redshift data show some tension with $\Lambda$CDM and seem to disfavour quintessence models (for a recent discussion and references see \cite{Wang:2018fng, Capozziello:2018jya, Dutta:2018vmq}).

In a Wilsonian approach, the value of $\langle V\rangle_0$ is the result of integrating out all modes from the UV down to the cosmological constant scale $\Lambda\sim {\rm meV}$. In string models, the 4D Wilsonian effective action is evaluated by integrating out all stringy and Kaluza-Klein modes down to the compactification scale $M_\KK \gg \Lambda$. Hence the vacuum energy computed in a 4D string compactification model $\langle V\rangle$ differs from $\langle V\rangle_0$ since it does not take into account corrections coming from integrating out light degrees of freedom associated to any energy scale $M$ between $M_\KK$ and $\Lambda$. Hence we have $\langle V\rangle_0 = \langle V\rangle + {O}(M^4)$. It is reasonable to expect $M\sim {\rm TeV}$ even if larger energy scales could also be present. Depending on the sign of these corrections, $\langle V\rangle$ can in principle be both positive and negative. It is therefore important to be able to obtain 4D string vacua with a positive vacuum energy which can be tuned to cancel potentially negative low-energy ${O}(M^4)$ corrections and give $\langle V\rangle_0 \sim \Lambda^4$. This is usually guaranteed by the flux landscape where one can choose background fluxes so that $\langle V\rangle$ cancels off any low energy correction, and then focuses on a small perturbation of the flux superpotential which gives $\langle V\rangle_0 \sim \Lambda^4$.


\subsection{Type IIB models: pros and cons}
\label{sec:ProsCons}

Moduli stabilisation is better understood in the context of type II models, and so we will focus only on type II dS constructions (see however \cite{Cicoli:2013rwa} for dS vacua in heterotic models\footnote{See also
\cite{Parameswaran:2010ec} for dS saddle points in heterotic
orbifolds.} and \cite{Acharya:2008zi} for dS solutions in M-theory models on $G_2$ manifolds). Type IIA models allow one to fix all the moduli at tree-level thanks to background fluxes. However so far no stable dS solution has been found \cite{Caviezel:2008tf, Flauger:2008ad, Danielsson:2009ff, Caviezel:2009tu, Danielsson:2010bc, Danielsson:2011au, Andriot:2018ept}. These constructions have the advantage of stabilising the moduli in 10D and at the classical level. However the 10D equations can be solved exactly only under the approximation of smeared sources which would lead to a Calabi-Yau internal manifold. However, in the localised case, the 4D effective field theory picture is not under control since the backreaction of the fluxes on the internal geometry cannot be neglected and leads to a half-flat non-Calabi-Yau metric \cite{Acharya:2006ne, McOrist:2012yc}. This is a serious issue for the trustability of these solutions.

Non-geometric constructions seem to yield dS vacua without tachyons \cite{deCarlos:2009fq, Danielsson:2012by, Blaback:2013ht, Damian:2013dq, Damian:2013dwa}. However also in this case the form of the effective action is not fully under control since the exact form of the moduli space is unknown. Moreover a tree-level stabilisation procedure naturally gives rise to a 4D potential of order the string scale with ${O}(1)$ values of the internal volume, and so it is not clear if $\alpha'$ effects can consistently be neglected.  

Type IIB models are instead characterised by the no-scale structure which makes the K\"ahler moduli massless at tree-level. These directions are then stabilised by the inclusion of perturbative (in both $\alpha'$ and $g_s$) and non-perturbative corrections to the effective action which allow to find stable vacua in the regime of large volume and weak coupling. In this way one can avoid the main part of the Dine-Seiberg problem \cite{Dine:1985he}. For this reason several dS mechanisms have been proposed within the type IIB framework. In what follows we shall first briefly review the main features of type IIB flux compactifications, and then discuss the advantages and challenges of these constructions.


\subsubsection{Overview of IIB flux compactifications}

Type IIB compactifications on orientifolds of a Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold $X$ have several special features that make them promising frameworks to address moduli stabilisation. Let us briefly review the structure of their effective field theory (EFT). The relevant fields are the axio-dilaton $S$, the complex structure moduli $U_a$, $a=1,\cdots, h^{1,2}$ and the K\"ahler moduli $T_i$, $i=1,\cdots, h^{1,1}$ where $h^{1,2}$ and $h^{1,1}$ are the Hodge numbers of the compact CY space. The tree-level K\"ahler potential is:
\begin{equation}
K=-2\ln{V}-\ln\left(S+\bar{S}\right)-\ln \left(-{\rm i}\, \int_X \Omega\wedge \bar{\Omega}\right),
\label{Ktree}
\end{equation}
where ${V} = \ell_s^{-6} \int_X \sqrt{g_{(6)}}\, d^6 y$ is the CY volume in units of the string length $\ell_s$. The internal volume ${V}$ is a homogeneous function of degree $3/2$ of the real parts of the K\"ahler moduli $\tau_i$ that determine the sizes of internal 4-cycles. $\Omega$ is instead the holomorphic $(3,0)$-form of the CY manifold. In the presence of fluxes, the superpotential takes the form \cite{Gukov:1999ya}:
\begin{equation}
W_\flux=\int_X G_3\wedge \Omega\,,
\label{Wflux}
\end{equation}
where the 3-form flux $G_3=F_3-{\rm i}SH_3$ contains the NS-NS flux $H_3$ and the RR flux $F_3$. These 3-form fluxes are quantised since their integrals over 
the many 3-cycles of the CY space give rise to flux integers which generate a potential for the $S$ and $U$-moduli. Hence the superpotential (\ref{Wflux}) naturally fixes the dilaton and all complex structure moduli and reduces the number of vacua from a continuum to a discrete but large set of points determined by quantised 3-form fluxes \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss, Giddings:2001yu}. The minimisation conditions require $G_3$ to be imaginary self-dual, i.e. $*_6 G_3 ={\rm i} G_3$, which is compatible with the Hodge decomposition $G_3\in(2,1)\oplus(0,3)$. Notice that in general this solution breaks supersymmetry since supersymmetry is preserved only if the $(0,3)$ component is turned off, as considered in \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss}.  

The K\"ahler moduli $T_i$ are not stabilised by 3-form fluxes. The reason behind this is the fact that there exists a Peccei-Quinn symmetry $T_i\rightarrow T_i +{\rm i} c_i$ with constant $c_i$'s that, together with the holomorphicity of the superpotential, forbids any $T_i$ dependence of $W$ to all orders in perturbation theory. However these moduli are the gauge couplings for matter fields localised on D7-branes, and so effects like gaugino condensation on D7-branes or Euclidean D3-instantons \cite{Blumenhagen:2009qh} generate a non-perturbative superpotential for these fields. The total superpotential for closed string moduli is:
\begin{equation}
W=W_{\rm flux}(S,U)+W_{\rm np}(S,U,T)\,.
\label{Wtotal}
\end{equation}
The starting point  of the 4D EFT is the F-term supergravity scalar potential for arbitrary superpotential $W(\Phi_M)$ and K\"ahler potential $K(\Phi_M, \bar{\Phi}_{\bar{M}})$ in units of $M_{\rm p}$:
\begin{equation}
V_F= e^K\left(K^{M\overline{N}}\, D_M W \overline{D}_{\overline{M}} \overline{W} - 3|W|^2\right) \,,
\label{VF}
\end{equation}
where $D_M W = \partial_M W + \left(\partial_M K\right) W$. The tree-level K\"ahler potential for the K\"ahler moduli satisfies the celebrated no-scale property $K^{T_i\bar{T}_{\bar{j}}} K_{T_i} K_{\bar{T}_{\bar{j}}}=3$ which is just a consequence of the homogeneity of ${V}$. Using this and the fact that the flux superpotential does not depend on the $T$-fields, the scalar potential can be easily shown to be positive definite for the $S$ and $U$-moduli which are stabilised supersymmetrically by solving $D_{U_a} W=D_SW=0$. As long as these equations have solutions for different values of the quantised fluxes, they generate the huge number of solutions that define the string landscape. However at this stage all these are Minkowski vacua where the K\"ahler moduli are still exact flat directions. For a generic non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the tree-level flux superpotential $W_0\equiv W_{\rm flux}(\langle S\rangle,\langle U\rangle)$, corresponding to a non-zero $(0,3)$ component of $G_3$, the $T$-moduli break supersymmetry since $D_{T_i} W = K_{T_i} W_0\neq 0$ \cite{Giddings:2001yu}.

Two main scenarios have emerged to fix the K\"ahler moduli: the original KKLT proposal \cite{Kachru:2003aw} and the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Conlon:2005ki, Cicoli:2008va}. Both focus on the $W_0\neq 0$ case. KKLT uses the fact that $W_0$ can be tuned to small values in order to compete with the small non-perturbative effects in $W_{\rm np}$ to produce an AdS minimum for the $T$-fields. In this case the minimum is at $D_{T_i} W=0$ and supersymmetry is restored. On the other hand, in LVS, instead of tuning $W_0$, the leading order no-scale breaking effect, which is a ${V}$-dependent $\alpha'$ correction, competes with non-perturbative corrections that depend on a blow-up mode wrapped by an ED3-instanton or a D7-stack supporting gaugino condensation. At the resulting AdS minimum, the volume ${V}\sim e^{1/g_s}\gg 1$ is exponentially large in string units and supersymmetry is broken by the F-terms of the K\"ahler moduli.

Since perturbative and non-perturbative effects play an important r\^ole to fix the K\"ahler moduli, let us sketch the general structure of these corrections to $K$ and $W$. First of all, it is crucial to observe that string theory has no free parameter since each coupling corresponds to the value of a different modulus: the string coupling $g_s = 1/{\rm Re}(S)$ is determined by the dilaton which sets also the coupling of gauge theories living on D3-branes at singularities, while the K\"ahler moduli control $\alpha'$ effects which come in an expansion in inverse powers of ${V}$ and the coupling of gauge theories living on D7-branes wrapping internal 4-cycles. Hence stabilising the moduli corresponds to fixing the value of the expansion parameters. Contrary to standard field theories, string compactifications therefore feature many expansion parameters. This makes difficult to extract exact results but also provides much flexibility regarding weak coupling expansions. For weak coupling, the leading order correction to the tree-level K\"ahler potential for the $T$-moduli in (\ref{Ktree}) comes from perturbative effects (either in $\alpha'$ or $g_s$) and we generically denote it as:
\begin{equation}
K=-2\ln{V}+ K_{\rm p}\,.
\label{Kp}
\end{equation}
The total superpotential (\ref{Wtotal}) takes instead the schematic form:
\begin{equation}
W=W_0+ W_{\rm np}\,.
\label{Wnp}
\end{equation}
Thus the F-term scalar potential can be expanded as: 
\begin{equation}
V=V_0 +\delta V\,,
\end{equation}
where the tree-level potential $V_0$ is positive definite due to the no-scale structure and vanishes at the minimum after the $S$ and $U$-moduli are stabilised. In the space of solutions for which ${\rm Re}(S)\gg 1$, the string loop expansion is under control. Since $V_0=0$, the minimum of the potential in the K\"ahler moduli space is determined by the quantum corrections $\delta V$. Determining the leading contributions to $\delta V$ is therefore crucial to properly stabilise the moduli. From the expansions in (\ref{Kp}) and (\ref{Wnp}), the structure of $\delta V$ takes schematically the form \cite{Conlon:2005ki}:
\begin{equation}
\delta V\propto e^K\left( W_0^2 \,K_{\rm p} + W_0\, W_{\rm np}\right)\,.
\label{eq:deltaV}
\end{equation} 
If there were only one single expansion parameter and if $W_0\gg W_{\rm np}$ and $K_{\rm p}\gg W_{\rm np}$ (since at weak coupling perturbative physics dominates over non-perturbative terms), the first term would be the leading order term. It would lift the potential but would give rise to a runaway behaviour, unless terms of different order in the perturbative expansion compete to give a minimum which would however arise only in a regime where the perturbative expansion breaks down since the corresponding expansion parameter would not be small. This is the Dine-Seiberg problem \cite{Dine:1985he}. 

Type IIB flux compactifications provide two ways to overcome this problem. First, in the KKLT scenario the big discrete degeneracy of flux vacua is used to tune $W_0$ to an exponentially small value so that $W_0\sim W_{\rm np}$. This then requires $W_{\rm np}^2$ terms to be also included in (\ref{eq:deltaV}) stabilising the $T$-fields when they compete with $W_0\, W_{\rm np}$ terms \cite{Kachru:2003aw}. Notice that in this limit quantum corrections to the K\"ahler potential can be consistently neglected since the first term in (\ref{eq:deltaV}) is subdominant given that $W_0^2 \,K_{\rm p} \ll W_0\, W_{\rm np} \sim W_0^2$ for $K_{\rm p}\ll 1$ (this is always the case at large volume since the perturbative effects $K_{\rm p}$ are suppressed by inverse powers of ${V}$).

The second case is LVS models where the fact that there is more than one expansion parameter plays the key r\^ole. In this case the two terms in (\ref{eq:deltaV}) can compete with each other to provide a minimum as long as each comes from a different expansion. Hence at the minimum one has $W_0^2\,K_{\rm p}\sim W_0 \,W_{\rm np}$ which, for $K_{\rm p}\sim 1/{V}$ and $W_{\rm np}\sim e^{-{\tau_s}}$, yields an overall volume of order ${V}\sim W_0\, e^{\tau_s}$. Here $\tau_s$ is a blow-up mode that gets stabilised to values of order $1/g_s$. It is therefore large for weak string coupling, implying that the CY volume is exponentially large \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Conlon:2005ki, Cicoli:2008va}. 

In summary, KKLT requires a major tuning of the fluxes to obtain $W_0\sim W_{\rm np}\ll 1$, whereas LVS works for natural values of the flux superpotential of order $W_0\sim {O}(1-100)$ (as found in concrete examples \cite{Louis:2012nb, Cicoli:2013cha}) but depends more on perturbative corrections to $K$. Notice that, from the $e^K$ factor in the general expression (\ref{VF}), the order of $V_0$ is $V_0\sim M_{\rm p}^4/{V}^2 \sim M_s^4$, whereas in LVS the order of $\delta V$ is $\delta V\sim W_0^2 M_{\rm p}^4 /{V}^3 \sim M_s^2 m_{3/2}^2\ll M_s^4$. Having $V_0$ vanishing at the minimum and $\delta V\ll M_s^4$ supports the  validity of the EFT at scales below $M_s$.


\subsubsection{Advantages}

We would like here to emphasise several advantages of type IIB constructions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Controlled flux backreaction}: Background fluxes can be turned on to generate a potential for the moduli in a controlled way since their backreaction on the internal geometry just renders the compactification manifold conformally Calabi-Yau. Therefore the understanding of the underlying moduli space is better than in other string theories. Some progress has been  made  recently in computing the  form of the K\"ahler potential including the effect of warping \cite{deAlwis:2003sn,Giddings:2005ff,Douglas:2007tu,Shiu:2008ry,Douglas:2008jx,Frey:2008xw,Martucci:2009sf,Martucci:2014ska}. Notice that the warping induces corrections to the definition of the correct moduli coordinates which are however negligible at large volume. 

\item \emph{Suppressed scalar potential scale}: The starting point of dS models is the classical low-energy limit of type IIB string theory compactified on a CY orientifold. This is a controlled procedure if the compactification volume is large so that the following hierarchy of scales is valid:
\begin{equation}
E\ll M_\KK=\frac{M_s}{{V}^{1/6}}\ll M_s \equiv\frac{1}{\ell_s} \equiv \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'}} =g_s^{1/4}\frac{M_{\rm p}}{\sqrt{4\pi{V}}}\,.
\end{equation}
As mentioned above, at tree-level the dilaton and the complex structure moduli are fixed supersymmetrically at $D_S W=D_U W=0$ via non-zero quantised $G_3$ fluxes \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss, Giddings:2001yu}. On the other hand, the K\"ahler moduli remain flat directions due to the no-scale structure. The scale of the potential at tree-level is of order $V_0 \sim M_s^4$ but its vacuum energy is vanishing due to the no-scale cancellation. This cancellation allows one to keep the value of the scalar potential around this minimum below the string and the Kaluza-Klein scale, and so guarantees that the effective field theory approach is under control.

\item \emph{Suppressed SUSY breaking scale}: As explained above, the
minimisation conditions $D_S W=D_U W=0$ imply that $G_3$ can only have
$(2,1)$ and $(0,3)$ components. Hence in general supersymmetry is broken
at tree-level by the F-terms of the K\"ahler moduli which are proportional
to the $(0,3)$ component of $G_3$ and scale as $F^T =
e^{K/2}\,K^{T\bar{T}} K_{\bar{T}} W_0 \sim \frac{W_0}{{V}^{1/3}}$.
Therefore the scale of supersymmetry breaking is very low since the
gravitino mass $m_{3/2}= e^{K/2} W_0 \sim \frac{W_0}{{V}}$ is
hierarchically smaller than the Kaluza-Klein scale $M_{\rm KK}\sim
M_s/{V}^{1/6} \sim 1/{V}^{2/3}$ for either $W_0\ll 1$ (as in KKLT
constructions) or ${V} \gg 1$ (as in LVS models)\footnote{Notice that in
F-theory models where the string coupling can be arbitrarily large, this
tree-level analysis clearly cannot be trusted.}. Thanks to this
suppression of the supersymmetry breaking scale, it is thus sensible to
compute non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential in a
supersymmetric setup even if ref. \cite{Sethi:2017phn} pointed out that
this can be rigorously done only in the specific case where only $(2,1)$
background fluxes are turned on as considered in \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss}.
In fact, in this case $W_0=0$ which implies $F^T=0$. However this case
necessitates a purely non-perturbative stabilisation of the $T$-moduli
which requires a racetrack-type superpotential whose microscopic origin is
only poorly understood.

\item \emph{Absence of quantum instabilities}: The inclusion of $\alpha'$ corrections to $K$ leads to a runaway instability for the volume mode in the limit where the string coupling is set to zero. This has been claimed to be a potential problem in \cite{Sethi:2017phn}. However systems which are classically unstable do not need to be necessarily unstable also at the quantum level. In fact, when $g_s$ effects are turned on, non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential can dynamically turn out to be of the same order as $\alpha'$ effects in the regime of exponentially large volume where the scale of supersymmetry breaking is very small compared to the string scale. This is the case of LVS models where an analysis which includes only $\alpha'$ corrections but not instanton effects would be inconsistent since the stabilisation procedure shows that these two effects are of the same order of magnitude \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Conlon:2005ki, Cicoli:2008va}. Notice that this scenario works for the generic case when there is more than one K\"ahler modulus. It is precisely this feature that makes the scenario work since a minimum (which in the simplest case without additional sectors responsible to achieve dS is non-supersymmetric AdS) is dynamically generated by the competition of two \textit{different} expansions: the perturbative $\alpha'$ expansion in powers of $1/{V}$, and the non-perturbative expansion for the small modulus in $e^{-\tau_s}$. This explains the exponentially large volume ${V}\sim e^{1/g_s}$ since $\tau_s\sim 1/g_s$ where $g_s$ is taken to be in the weak coupling regime after dilaton stabilisation by suitable 3-form fluxes. On the other hand, in KKLT models, the tuning of the flux superpotential $W_0$ to small values (assuming it can be done for which a large number of complex structure moduli is usually needed) renders non-perturbative corrections to the 4D scalar potential even dominant with respect to $\alpha'$ contributions which can therefore be safely neglected. In this case a supersymmetric AdS vacuum is obtained by balancing $W_0$ against non-perturbative effects \cite{Kachru:2003aw}.

\item \emph{Progress in computing quantum effects}: A lot of progress has been made during the last years to compute non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential (Euclidean D3-brane instantons in particular \cite{Blumenhagen:2009qh}) and perturbative (both in $\alpha'$ and $g_s$) corrections to the K\"ahler potential. After the original computation of $N=2$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential $K$ \cite{Becker:2002nn}, additional $N=2$ ${O}(g_s^2 \alpha'^2)$ and ${O}(g_s^2 \alpha'^4)$ contribution to $K$ have been derived in \cite{Berg:2005ja} and generalised in \cite{Berg:2007wt}. Ref. \cite{Cicoli:2007xp} showed the existence of an \textit{extended no-scale structure} since ${O}(g_s^2 \alpha'^2)$ contributions to the scalar potential cancel off. This result is crucial for the stability of LVS models. Relatively recently there has been substantial progress in understanding also $N=1$ perturbative effects. Ref. \cite{Grimm:2013gma} showed that $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^2)$ corrections to the effective action give rise to moduli redefinitions, while ref. \cite{Minasian:2015bxa} found that $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ effects produce a shift of the CY Euler number term\footnote{See also \cite{Anguelova:2010ed} for $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^2)$ corrections to $K$ in heterotic constructions which should get mapped to type IIB ${O}(g_s^2\alpha'^2)$ effects that enjoy the extended no-scale cancellation.}. Moreover, ref. \cite{Bonetti:2016dqh} reconsidered $N=2$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ contributions to $K$ including the backreaction of these corrections on the internal geometry and found that they induce moduli redefinitions. Interesting progress has also been made in the computation of higher derivative $N=2$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ terms \cite{Ciupke:2015msa, Grimm:2017okk} which can have promising implications for moduli stabilisation and cosmology \cite{Broy:2015zba, Cicoli:2016chb}. Finally ref. \cite{Berg:2014ama, Haack:2015pbv,Haack:2018ufg} have recently derived $N=1$ string loop corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert term showing that they generate $g_s^2$ corrections to a term involving the CY Euler number\footnote{See also \cite{Antoniadis:2018hqy} for additional $g_s$ corrections to $K$.}. We list the important corrections that still remain to be computed in the next section focused on challenges.

It is worth stressing that none of the perturbative $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ corrections listed above create instabilities for LVS models. On the other hand, corrections which are subleading in an inverse ${V}$-expansion turn out to be very useful to lift leading order flat directions with interesting implications for cosmology and particle phenomenology. Notice also that sometimes one does not need to derive the full functional dependence of these corrections on all moduli, but it is sufficient to determine their dependence on the K\"ahler moduli which have still to be stabilised. Moreover, the functional dependence of string loop corrections to $K$ on the K\"ahler moduli is the easiest to determine (together with the dilaton dependence) from both generalisations of toroidal computations and low-energy arguments \cite{Cicoli:2007xp, Burgess:2010sy}. Another powerful tool is the requirement of the positivity and convergence of the K\"ahler metric (see section 5.2 of \cite{Conlon:2006gv}). On the other hand, the dependence on the $U$-moduli is the hardest to determine but, given that the complex structure moduli have already been fixed at tree-level in terms of background fluxes, these can be safely considered just to give rise to tunable ${O}(1)$ coefficients. 

Furthermore, it has been established in \cite{Burgess:2005jx} that even though the flux superpotential $W_0$ depends explicitly on the dilaton which is directly related to the string coupling, the superpotential is still not renormalised at any order in perturbation theory. This is non-trivial since the standard arguments for the non-renormalisability of $W$ relied on the fact that $W$ did not depend on the string coupling \cite{Witten:1985bz, Burgess:1985zz, Dine:1986vd}.
 
\item \emph{Controlled higher derivative corrections}: As shown in \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}, the superspace derivative expansion is under control if $W_0\ll {V}^{1/3}$ which corresponds to requiring a gravitino mass which is hierarchically smaller than the Kaluza-Klein scale. This can be guaranteed by either tuning $W_0\ll 1$ as in KKLT models or by ${V} \gg 1$ as in LVS constructions.

\item \emph{Hierarchies for phenomenology}: Type IIB models where non-perturbative effects play a crucial r\^ole for moduli stabilisation are particularly promising for phenomenological applications. In fact, they can generate hierarchies exploiting the exponential suppression typical of non-perturbative effects. This allows one to obtain energy scales like the inflationary scale, the gravitino mass, the soft terms or the moduli masses which are much smaller than the string scale. Without using quantum effects, it is at the moment unknown how to obtain nice phenomenological implications of string vacua.

\item \emph{dS mechanisms}: Several mechanisms have been proposed to obtain dS vacua in type IIB models. In this paper we will avoid the use of the terminology \emph{uplift} since it conveys the wrong idea that moduli stabilisation proceeds in two steps, obtaining first an AdS vacuum which is subsequently uplifted to dS by adding by hand a new ingredient in the compactification. The mechanisms proposed in the literature proceed instead in just a single step where a dS vacuum is achieved by the interplay of several contributions to the 4D scalar potential. Some of the most popular dS mechanisms are: ($i$) anti-branes \cite{Kachru:2003aw}, ($ii$) T-branes \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx}, ($iii$) $\alpha'$ effects \cite{Westphal:2006tn}, ($iv$) non-perturbative effects at singularities \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}, ($v$) non-zero $S$ and $U$ F-terms \cite{Gallego:2017dvd}. 

\item \emph{Explicit global models}: A fully working 4D string model, should not lead just to a dS vacuum but it should also include SM-like chiral matter, an inflationary sector and a concrete embedding in globally consistent Calabi-Yau compactifications with an explicit choice of the orientifold involution, the brane setup, background and gauge fluxes. A lot of progress in this direction has been made recently within the type IIB framework \cite{Cicoli:2011qg, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013mpa, Cicoli:2013cha, Cicoli:2016xae, Cicoli:2017shd, Cicoli:2017axo}.

\item \emph{Freedom to tune the vacuum energy}: As explained above, obtaining a dS vacuum is not sufficient to match observational data since one should also have enough tuning freedom to reproduce $\langle V\rangle_0 = \Lambda^4$. In type IIB scenarios, contrary to type IIA or non-geometric constructions, this is guaranteed by the fact that the number of flux quanta (from RR and NSNS 3-form fluxes) is twice as large as the number of moduli fixed at tree-level. Notice also that the main phenomenological features of a given model are almost insensitive to this tuning of the cosmological constant. 

\item \emph{Sources of open string moduli fixing}: Most of the dS constructions available in the literature just focus on the stabilisation of the closed string moduli but a full working model should include the stabilisation of the open string moduli as well. For a concrete global model with full closed and open string moduli stabilisation see \cite{Cicoli:2017axo}. In type IIB constructions with D3 and D7 branes most of the open string moduli get fixed by background fluxes. These can be seen as supersymmetry breaking soft term contributions to the scalar potential of D7 deformation moduli and open strings at the intersection between different stacks of D7-branes \cite{Camara:2004jj}. D3 open string modes are instead flat directions at tree-level but they can be stabilised by non-zero soft term masses which can arise either from $\alpha'$ corrections to the matter K\"ahler metric and non-zero F-terms of the $T$-moduli induced by 3-form fluxes, or from non-zero F-terms of the $S$ and $U$-moduli corresponding to IASD background fluxes which are dynamically induced by quantum corrections to the GKP solution \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}. Notice that IASD fluxes can be consistently included only in the presence of $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects which give leading contributions to the soft terms\footnote{In fact, considering IASD fluxes without including these quantum corrections, leads to phenomenological inconsistencies as found in \cite{Bena:2015qfa}.}. Finally D7 Wilson line moduli develop a scalar potential due to gauge fluxes \cite{Marchesano:2014iea}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Challenges}

We shall now discuss the main challenges that type IIB models face to reach a higher level of control. Notice that most of these challenges are shared also by 4D $N=1$ supersymmetric Minkowski and AdS solutions. Hence if they are considered as indications against the existence of stable dS vacua, they should also be taken into account in criticizing existing supersymmetric solutions relevant for phenomenological applications. Here is a list of some important challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Full control of quantum corrections}: The fact that the type IIB no-scale cancellation requires the inclusion of quantum corrections to lift the K\"ahler moduli has been the source of criticism due to the difficulty to compute all these effects in a systematic way. This criticism is indeed partially well-grounded since we are still lacking a deep understanding of both string loop corrections for arbitrary Calabi-Yau backgrounds and the exact form of $\alpha'$ corrections to the bulk and the D-brane action. Nonetheless, as discussed above, a lot of progress has been done recently, non just in computing different quantum corrections but also in estimating the volume scaling of corrections which can be neglected in the large volume limit. In this direction, as emphasised in \cite{Conlon:2006gv}, one of the most important questions is to to generalise the exact results for toroidal orientifolds in \cite{Berg:2005ja} to orientifolded Calabi-Yaus with non-zero 3-form fluxes. In fact, all other corrections relevant for the stability of the LVS vacua can be eliminated from considerations of the positivity of the K\"ahler metric \cite{Conlon:2006gv}. 

Notice that the extended no-scale structure which protects the stability of LVS models is enjoyed by any perturbative correction which is of ${O}(\alpha'^2)$ regardless of the order in the string loop expansion \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. Hence any correction to $K$ of ${O}(\alpha'^2 g_s^n)$ $\forall n$ does not destabilise LVS models. Dangerous corrections would be of ${O}(\alpha')$ at any order in the string coupling. However so far no contribution to the K\"ahler potential of this order has been found. In order to give a definite answer to this question it would be crucial to understand the form of string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential in the presence of supersymmetry breaking background fluxes. 
 
Furthermore, even if in the past decade there has been substantial progress in the understanding of Euclidean D3-instantons \cite{Blumenhagen:2009qh}, we are still lacking a complete picture of these $g_s$ non-perturbative effects regarding the exact moduli-dependence of their prefactor or zero-mode lifting by gauge and background fluxes. Let us however point out that unknown ${O}(1)$ coefficients of these non-perturbative effects do not tend to affect the main qualitative and quantitative results of moduli stabilisation. In addition, gaugino condensation on D7-branes has been well understood from the standard 4D effective field theory point of view but it is more difficult to study using the full 10D effective action and the full string theory.

Present technology only allows for the computation of the volumes of 4-cycles and 2-cycles after moduli stabilisation. This gives information only about the average size of the curvatures, and so in principle a 2-cycle with volume which is large in string units can be anisotropic and have regions with high curvature. While this is a challenge, it is not expected to be a generic issue. 

\item \emph{Parametrically small parameters}: No dS construction is characterised by full parametric control of the expansions used to stabilise the moduli as opposed to AdS/CFT where the $1/N$ expansion can be trusted in the large $N$ limit. While this is a fully valid theoretical objection, we argue that small expansion parameters, even if not parametrically small, are still good enough to trust the phenomenological implications of the results. A primary example is QED where the perturbative expansion is an asymptotic series which can give only an approximate result up to non-perturbative effects. One gets closer and closer to an exact result only when the expansion parameter $\alpha_\QED$ gets closer and closer to zero which in QED is the Gaussian fixed point at vanishing energy. However, experiments are performed at a fixed energy scale, and so $\alpha_\QED$ is fixed when confronting data and cannot be set arbitrarily small. Nonetheless perturbative QED yields results which reproduce data extremely well. In string compactifications, the parameter controlling the $\alpha'$ expansion is $1/{V} \ll 1$ where ${V}$ is the internal volume in string units which can be exponentially large in type IIB LVS models \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Conlon:2005ki, Cicoli:2008va}. The limit $1/{V} \to 0$ would imply a string scale $M_s\sim M_{\rm p}/\sqrt{{V}}$ below the TeV scale, and so it is not phenomenologically allowed. Theoretically it is the decoupling limit of 4D gravity and leads to 10D string theory. However in our phenomenological applications we are at finite but sufficiently small values of $1/{V}$ as to be able to trust the $\alpha'$ expansion. Similar considerations apply to the string coupling which in a given point of the type IIB flux landscape is lower bounded by tadpole cancellation but can still be small enough to trust the perturbative expansion. Whether one can really justify these expansions as asymptotic series like in QED is currently unknown but hopefully may be settled at some point.

\item \emph{Supersymmetric $N=1$ vacua}: As stressed above, the main obstacle against constructing dS vacua is the difficulty to have an effective field theory which is under full control. The reason for the lack of full calculational control is the lack of supersymmetry for any dS vacuum which holds in any spacetime dimension. Therefore the apparent difficulty to obtain dS vacua may be more related to the simple fact that we do not have enough reliable techniques to tackle theories with broken supersymmetry. However it is important to stress that most of the challenges are shared also by 4D $N=1$ supersymmetric Minkowski or AdS vacua relevant for phenomenology. In fact, even if supersymmetry helps to control the structure of the effective field theory, $N=1$ models are still subject to quantum corrections whose exact form for arbitrary Calabi-Yau orientifold backgrounds has not been fully understood yet. Moreover, supersymmetric vacua do not seem very suitable starting points for phenomenological applications since they are in general characterised by flat directions which can develop a runaway behaviour when one moves away from the vacuum to break supersymmetry. A primary example of supersymmetric vacua suffering from this problem is the type IIB case where only supersymmetric $(2,1)$ $G_3$ background fluxes are turned on \cite{Dasgupta:1999ss,Giddings:2001yu}. These are $N=1$ 4D vacua where the K\"ahler moduli are flat directions. In order to be consistent with observations, one has to break supersymmetry. If this is done by moving the dilaton or the complex structure moduli away from their supersymmetric minimum, the K\"ahler moduli become unstable runaways. Alternatively, one could try to stabilise the K\"ahler moduli in a supersymmetric minimum and move them away from it to break supersymmetry while keeping the dilaton and the complex structure moduli at their minimum. However, in order to lift the K\"ahler directions, one would need to include non-perturbative effects whose 10D origin has not been fully understood yet.

\item \emph{D3-branes and sequestering}: The effective action of D3-branes at singularities is arguably the least understood aspect of 4D type IIB models. Even though a standard expansion around vanishing vacuum expectation values, as usually done for matter fields, can provide useful information \cite{Conlon:2008wa}, it would be desirable to develop a better understanding of the dependence of the K\"ahler potential on blow-up modes and open string matter fields around the singularity. A particularly interesting issue for phenomenology is a systematic study of all possible effects (perturbative and non-perturbative) which can break the sequestering of the visible sector on D3-branes from the sources of supersymmetry breaking in the bulk.

\item \emph{Explicit full moduli stabilisation}: Stabilising all closed and open string moduli in a controlled way in an explicit Calabi-Yau example is a very demanding task. Above all, because of the difficulty to solve the minimisation equations in the presence of a large number of complex structure and open string moduli. A lot of progress has been made in this direction \cite{Cicoli:2011qg, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013mpa, Cicoli:2013cha, Cicoli:2016xae, Cicoli:2017shd, Cicoli:2017axo} (in particular models with  an effective small number of complex structure moduli) but a globally consistent model with full moduli stabilisation in a controlled dS vacuum has still to be achieved. However given the existence of a very large number of flux configurations it would be very surprising if there is no solution to these equations.

\item \emph{Realistic phenomenology}: The present accelerated expansion of our universe is just one observational feature of Nature. Other crucial characteristics of our world are chiral matter, the SM gauge group, dark matter and inflation. Hence it does not make that much sense to obtain dS vacua which cannot realise these other crucial phenomenological features. In the past few years there has been substantial progress in building global models with dS, chiral matter and inflation \cite{Cicoli:2017shd, Cicoli:2017axo} but a fully working model which can allow for both a realistic cosmology and particle physics is still missing.

\item \emph{F-theory moduli stabilisation}: Type IIB models are  the weak coupling limit of more general F-theory constructions. In order to gain more control over moduli stabilisation and D-brane model building, it is therefore fundamental to understand the F-theory uplift of the existing type IIB dS mechanisms. Another crucial issue to address is moduli stabilisation directly within the F-theory framework. 

\item\emph{Populating the landscape}: The landscape scenario to address the dark energy problem needs crucially a mechanism to populate the landscape. A concrete point is that even though the flux superpotential $W_0$ is only bounded by $W_0\ll {V}^{1/3}$, the tuning needed to address the dark energy problem requires a discretuum determined by a distribution of values of $W_0$ such that $\delta W_0$ can be made as small as possible. For this, Calabi-Yau compactifications with at least hundreds of complex structure moduli are needed to be stabilised, making the computational challenges extremely difficult. Furthermore a full quantitative understanding regarding the vacuum transitions among different solutions is not under full control yet.
\end{enumerate}

Having discussed the general pros and cons of IIB flux compactifications, in the following sections we will analyse more in detail the advantages and the challenges of concrete mechanisms to achieve dS vacua (see also \cite{Danielsson:2018ztv}).


\subsection{Anti-branes}
\label{Dbar}

Adding anti D3-branes to the KKLT and LVS setups provides a simple positive contribution to the vacuum energy coming from their tension. This is the concrete KKLT proposal based on the KPV construction \cite{Kachru:2002gs} on brane-flux annihilation for which an anti-brane sitting at the tip of a throat induced by the 3-form fluxes can annihilate with the fluxes after polarising a NS5-brane which later decays. This process can be described in terms of quantum tunneling through a barrier. Fluxes can be tuned to control the size of the throat that can be used to adjust the vacuum energy to desired values. As emphasised above, this mechanism can be considered together with fluxes and non-perturbative effects although in the original presentation it was introduced as an uplift mechanism of the original AdS vacuum providing a positive correction to the scalar potential of the form:
\begin{equation}
\Delta V = \frac{e^A}{{V}^\gamma}\,,
\label{uplift}
\end{equation}
with $e^A$ the flux-induced warp factor and $\gamma=4/3$ in the warped region while $\gamma=2$ in an unwarped region. The warp factor can be used to tune the minimum to dS at almost zero vacuum energy.

\subsubsection*{Criticism 1}

Since it was proposed, this has been considered as the weakest part of the KKLT proposal. Despite the relation with the KPV scenario, adding an anti-brane seems  arbitrary. It also seems to break supersymmetry explicitly, losing computational control of the EFT and giving a runaway behaviour to 10D at the classical level\footnote{For an early discussion of the problems with anti-branes in KKLT see \cite{Brustein:2004xn}.}. Furthermore the original scenario was not substantiated by explicit models on concrete Calabi-Yau orientifolds. More recently detailed study of the geometry corresponding to anti-branes on a throat indicated the presence of singularities that were claimed to destabilise the KKLT system if anti-branes were present \cite{Bena:2009xk, Bena:2012bk}.

 
\subsubsection*{Comments}

The anti-brane sector has been probably the most questioned component of the KKLT proposal. Regarding the apparent arbitrariness, the KPV scenario already provides a natural motivation for its consideration. The fact that supersymmetry is broken has been better understood by the recent developments relating the EFT of the anti-brane to non-linearly realised supersymmetry {\it a la}  Volkov and Akulov. Moreover, a concrete superspace formulation in terms of a nilpotent chiral superfield $X$ ($X^2=0$) \cite{Ferrara:2014kva, Bergshoeff:2015jxa} captures precisely the term in \eqref{uplift} by adding to the original superpotential and K\"ahler potential  a general dependence on $X$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta W= c \,X\,,  \qquad \Delta K = \beta\, X\bar{X}\,.
\end{equation}
Here $c$ is in principle a function of the complex structure moduli which can be naturally associated to warping while $\beta$ depends also on the K\"ahler  moduli. The superfield $X$ has a single propagating degree of freedom corresponding to the goldstino. Concrete Calabi-Yau orientifolds have been constructed (compact and non-compact) with precisely this single degree of freedom \cite{Kallosh:2015nia, Garcia-Etxebarria:2015lif}, so providing the first explicit realisations of the dS KKLT scenario. Finally an EFT analysis of the anti-brane singularity has been done for the simplest case of one single anti-brane (which is sufficient to achieve dS) for which the probe approximation is under control and no divergences are found, so addressing the anti-brane induced singularity problem \cite{Michel:2014lva, Polchinski:2015bea}. The same conclusion has been reached recently using different techniques \cite{Cohen-Maldonado:2015ssa, Cohen-Maldonado:2015lyb, Danielsson:2018ztv}.
 

\subsubsection*{Criticism 2}

Another potential obstacle has been claimed by ref. \cite{Moritz:2017xto} regarding the calculation of non-perturbative effects when anti-branes are present. In an effort to have a 10D description of gaugino condensation, ref. \cite{Moritz:2017xto} developed a technique to compute the contribution of the anti-brane to the scalar potential and found no dS solution. This was understood also from the 4D EFT in terms of the nilpotent superfield $X$ by considering the $X$ dependence of $W$ as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta W= X\left(c+e \,W_{\rm np}\right).
\end{equation}
It is easy to check that for $c=0$ and $e\neq 0$ the contribution of $X$ to the scalar potential is such that there is no dS vacuum either in KKLT \cite{Moritz:2017xto} or in LVS \cite{MQRW}.

\subsubsection*{Comments}

The result regarding the non-perturbative superpotential in the presence of anti-branes is based on a number of different assumptions which are not fully justified. The most relevant is perhaps assuming that the dynamics of gaugino condensation $\langle \lambda \lambda\rangle $ can be described in terms of the $\lambda\lambda$ dependence of the classical action. Gaugino condensation is clearly a 4D non-perturbative effect due to the non-trivial low-energy dynamics of the corresponding gauge theory. Its effect needs to be computed by properly performing the path integral of the gauge degrees of freedom below the scale of the relevant gauge theory which is a highly complicated quantum calculation. It is actually known in field theory that properly computing the effective superpotential does not reproduce the result of naively substituting $\lambda\lambda\sim \Lambda\strong$ in the classical effective action where $\Lambda_\strong$ is the condensation scale. In fact, at least in the case of the heterotic string, one can show the conflict quite explicitly \cite{Brustein:2004xn,Nilles:2004zg}.

From the 4D EFT perspective, the fact that the coefficient $c$ vanishes in $\Delta W$ (needed to avoid dS) does not seem justified, especially since this leads to the term $X W_{\rm np}$ to be the dominant contribution which is instead expected to be very much suppressed since, besides the non-perturbative suppression, the coefficient $e$ is naively expected to be suppressed by warp factors (as for $c$ in the original case). Also in the absence of non-perturbative effects it is known that $c\neq 0$. Furthermore the analysis in \cite{Moritz:2017xto} does not include the case of Euclidean D3-instanton contributions to the scalar potential. The proposal presented in \cite{Moritz:2017xto} to obtain dS by considering a racetrack scenario, while possible, has not been implemented in concrete models and may be difficult to construct without fine-tuning coefficients of the non-perturbative terms. 


\subsection{T-branes}
\label{T}

T-branes represent a very generic and natural way to obtain dS vacua in type IIB models via the interplay of background and gauge fluxes. From the 4D point of view, this mechanism relies on non-zero F-terms of hidden sector fields driven by D-term stabilisation. The 8D understanding of this system involves a background with a T-brane which is a non-Abelian bound state of D7-branes induced by gauge fluxes. Expanding the T-brane action in the presence of supersymmetry breaking background fluxes gives rise to a positive definite contribution to the 4D scalar potential which can be used to obtain a dS vacuum \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx}. Let us stress that this approach to dS vacua has been used in several explicit global Calabi-Yau models \cite{Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013mpa, Cicoli:2013cha, Cicoli:2017shd}.

The generality of this mechanism is based on the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item D7 tadpole cancellation in models with O7-planes forces in general the presence of hidden sector stacks of D7-branes.

\item The absence of Freed-Witten anomalies on D7-branes requires in general to turn on half-integer gauge fluxes on the worldvolume of D7-branes \cite{Minasian:1997mm, Freed:1999vc}.

\item These gauge fluxes induce K\"ahler moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos terms \cite{Dine:1987xk,Dine:1987gj} which are cancelled by a non-zero vacuum expectation value of an open string mode charged under the corresponding anomalous $U(1)$. Hence this Abelian gauge group is broken and the corresponding gauge boson acquires a mass of order the string scale. This signals the fact that the anomalous $U(1)$ should not have been included in the 4D effective field theory. In fact, the correct low-energy theory should be built by expanding around a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the open string mode (as opposed to a vanishing value which would seem to lead to a $U(1)$ factor) which corresponds to a T-brane background characterised by a non-Abelian bound state of D7-branes without any $U(1)$ factor.

\item The tree-level GKP solution features $(0,3)$ background 3-form fluxes which break supersymmetry. 

\item These supersymmetry breaking fluxes induce soft term masses for open string modes on D7-branes which correspond to F-term contributions to the scalar potential \cite{Camara:2004jj}.

\item Expressing both the soft term masses and the vacuum expectation value of the charged open string mode in terms of the K\"ahler moduli, one obtains a positive definite volume-dependent contribution to the scalar potential which can raise the vacuum energy to dS.
\end{itemize}
Let us point out that, contrary to what has been claimed in \cite{Bena:2017uuz}, the dS construction of \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} does not require T-branes in the strong coupling regime since gauge flux densities are always below the string scale. In fact, the 8D BPS equation determining the T-brane background receives perturbative corrections which cannot be neglected when the Higgs vacuum expectation value is above the string scale, implying a large gauge flux density \cite{Minasian:2001na, Marchesano:2016cqg}. In this strong coupling regime, at least for the $N=2$ case with a large number of branes, the system has been shown to be describable in a dual picture which involves a single Abelian D-brane without flux but with worldvolume curvature \cite{Bena:2016oqr}. However the T-brane setup of \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} is in the weak coupling regime where the effective field theory is under control since the volume in string units of the 2-cycle supporting the gauge flux is always much larger than the flux quanta. The corresponding 4D Higgs field develops a vacuum expectation value of order the winding scale $M_\W \sim M_s {V}^{1/6} \sim M_{\rm p} /{V}^{1/3}$. Taking into account the right 4D field in Einstein frame, the condition of negligible perturbative corrections to the 8D BPS equation is a 4D Higgs field below the scale $M \sim M_{\rm p} / {V}^{1/6}$. For ${V} \gg 1$ the winding scale is below $M$, and so $\alpha'$ corrections to the Fayet-Iliopoulos term can be safely ignored. 

Let us finally mention that this dS mechanism has two limitations: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The D-term is proportional to the sum of the F-terms of the volume modulus and the charged open string mode. In KKLT models the F-term of the $T$-moduli is vanishing, and so a vanishing D-term necessarily implies also that the F-term of the Higgs field has to be zero. Hence dS KKLT vacua cannot be obtained via T-branes. On the other hand, in LVS models the F-term of the charged K\"ahler modulus is non-zero. This guarantees that the D-term can be set to zero (at least at leading order) in a way compatible with a non-vanishing F-term of the charged open string mode which determines the T-brane background. 

\item The volume-dependence of the positive definite contribution to the scalar potential from T-branes is $0.01 c \,{V}^{-8/3}$ where $c$ depends on gauge flux quanta. On the other hand, the LVS potential generated by $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects scales as ${V}^{-3} \sqrt{\ln\left(\frac{{V}}{W_0}\right)}$ \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx}. Given that the flux quanta are ${O}(1)$ integer parameters, the only quantity which can be tuned to obtain a dS vacuum is the tree-level superpotential $W_0$. For natural ${O}(1-10)$ values of $W_0$, T-branes allow for dS vacua with values of the volume in string units of order ${V}\sim 10^5-10^8$. Interestingly this is in the right ballpark to get low-energy supersymmetry in sequestered scenarios with the MSSM on D3-branes at singularities \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. However if the volume is raised to values of order ${V}\sim 10^{15}$, as needed to obtain TeV-scale soft terms in non-sequestered models \cite{Conlon:2005ki}, the T-brane contribution to the scalar potential would yield a runaway for the volume mode. Notice that this instability cannot be avoided by tuning $W_0$ extremely small since the vacuum expectation value of the volume mode is also proportional to $W_0$. This implies that in T-brane dS vacua with non-sequestered visible sector, the scale of supersymmetry breaking has necessarily to be rather high. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other dS mechanisms}
\label{OtherdS}

Since the original KKLT model several other mechanisms have been proposed mostly using string inspired field theoretical arguments in which F and/or D terms yield positive contributions to achieve dS (see for instance \cite{Burgess:2003ic, Villadoro:2005yq, Dudas:2006gr}). Even though these are not concrete string theory models, for most of these scenarios there may be a way that some of them can eventually find a stringy realisation. The main point is that there is a wide diversity of model dependence on the matter sector of the hidden sectors. Since the scalar potential of supergravity is not positive definite it is very plausible that there exist minima with all signs of the vacuum energy. The challenge is to have concrete compactifications in which the proposed F and D terms are realised with the matter content, matter superpotential and K\"ahler potential under control and that the corresponding extrema lie in regions of the moduli space in which the EFT can be trusted. 

We can highlight eight other string motivated proposals:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Non-critical strings} \cite{Maloney:2002rr}: Non-critical strings have a natural positive cosmological term (for $D>10$) that can be used to obtain dS upon compactification while fixing the moduli. It is not clear whether the corresponding EFT is  under control but this may be due only to our current limited understanding of the theory.

\item {\it Negative curvature spaces} \cite{Silverstein:2007ac}: Non-supersymmetric compactifications on manifolds with negative curvature naturally induce a positive term in the effective potential that can be used to obtain dS. Again, being non-supersymmetric, the EFT is under less control but these compactifications are in principle viable.

\item {\it K\"ahler uplift} \cite{Westphal:2006tn, deAlwis:2011dp, Rummel:2011cd}: Here $\alpha'$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential in the KKLT scenario can compete with the fluxes and the non-perturbatively effects to produce minima with positive vacuum energy. This is possible if the volume is small enough for $\alpha'$ corrections to be relevant. Therefore the obtained dS minima are in regions at the edge of validity of the EFT. An explicit CY compactification has been constructed in \cite{Louis:2012nb} with all geometric moduli stabilised to dS space.

\item {\it Dilaton dependent non-perturbative effects} \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}: In type IIB models hidden and observable sectors can be localised on either D3 or D7-branes. In general, non-perturbative effects depend on the $T$-modulus which controls the volume of the divisor wrapped by an ED3-instanton or by a D7-stack supporting gaugino condensation. Another possibility is however to consider dilaton-dependent non-perturbative effects coming from E($-1$)-instantons or strong dynamics on a hidden sector of D3-branes at singularities. In this case, after including the shift of the dilaton proportional to the blow-up mode resolving the singularity, the corresponding non-perturbative term generates a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential similar to that coming from anti-branes. Concrete CY compactifications with these superpotentials have not been constructed yet and it would be an interesting avenue to explore.

\item {\it Complex structure F-terms} \cite{Gallego:2017dvd}: The complex structure moduli have minima at the supersymmetric points $D_UW=0$. However there may be further minima for these fields for which $D_UW\neq 0$. These may give rise to dS minima without the need of further ingredients but need to tune quantities such that the corresponding new minimum, coming from ${O}(1/{V}^2)$ terms in the scalar potential, does not wash out the large volume minimum coming from terms of order ${O}(1/{V}^3)$. An intrinsic limitation of these constructions is the difficulty to realise explicit examples with large volume since they would require to fix a large number of complex structure moduli to achieve enough tuning freedom. A concrete example with ${V}\simeq 10^4$ was however constructed in \cite{Gallego:2017dvd} but using a continuous flux approximation.

\item {\it Non-perturbative dS vacua} \cite{Blaback:2013qza}: dS minima
can emerge from stabilising all the geometric moduli in just one-step via
the inclusion of just background fluxes and non-perturbative effects. The
main problems of this approach are the poor knowledge of the $S$ and
$U$-moduli dependence of the prefactor of non-perturbative effects and the
computational difficulty to find a numerical solution for the minimisation
equations in the presence of a large number of geometric moduli.

\item \textit{Heterotic dS vacua} \cite{Cicoli:2013rwa}: The heterotic string compactified on smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds can lead to 4D dS models where the gauge bundle moduli, together with the dilaton and the $U$-moduli are fixed supersymmetrically at leading order via the requirement of a holomorphic gauge bundle, fractional fluxes and non-perturbative effects. The K\"ahler moduli can instead be fixed a la LVS by the interplay of worldsheet instantons, $\alpha'$ effects and threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic function which provide a positive term responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. The main limitations of this construction are: $(i)$ the phenomenological value of the GUT gauge coupling forces the minimum to lie only at moderately large volume and $(ii)$ the lack of tunability of the vacuum energy due to the absence of Ramond-Ramond fluxes.

\item {\it $G_2$ compactifications} \cite{Acharya:2006ia,Acharya:2007rc}: Even though little is known about concrete $G_2$ holonomy compactifications of M-theory, interesting scenarios have been proposed addressing phenomenological issues. In particular, superpotentials with two exponentials but without fluxes have been proposed to stabilise all moduli. Some of the minima can be dS even if the absence of fluxes makes it difficult to tune the vacuum energy to small values. The freedom to perform this tuning relies on the possibility to find a small value of the cosmological constant by scanning through different ranks of the condensing gauge groups.
\end{itemize}




\section{Quintessence in string theory}
\label{sec:QuintessenceStrings}

In the previous section we have argued that there are explicit string theoretic constructions which seem to violate the conjecture (\ref{eq:SwamplandConjecture}) even if there are still some technical issues that have to be fully sorted out. In this section we will argue that the alternative, i.e. potentials which satisfy the conjecture and lead to quintessence models, are far less likely to be consequences of string theory.

The simplest alternative to a vacuum energy of order $\langle V\rangle_0 \sim \Lambda^4 \sim ({\rm meV})^4$ is a scalar field which is slow-rolling at positive energies. The dynamics of this scalar field is driving the present epoch of accelerated expansion (for a review see \cite{Tsujikawa:2013fta}). A simple example of such a phenomenological potential would be\footnote{In this section we work in Planck units except where other units are explicitly invoked for clarity.} $V= \Lambda^4\,e^{-\chi}$ where $\Lambda$ is the current dark energy scale at $\chi=0$ today. 

In the presence of a plethora of scalar fields like in the string landscape, it might seem rather natural to expect that one of them is at present rolling away from its minimum. This picture seems also to be suggested by the recently proposed swampland conjecture which forbids the existence of stable dS solutions \cite{Agrawal:2018own}. Even if this is still a conjecture not based on any rigorous derivation, it is worth exploring its phenomenological implications. In what follows we shall discuss in particular the interplay of quintessence and the swampland conjecture with the Higgs potential and low-redshift cosmological data.


\subsection{Challenges for quintessence}
\label{sec:QuintessenceChallenges}

The main challenges for quintessence are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Fine-tuning problems}: Standard dS models are plagued by the problem of obtaining the right value of the cosmological constant. Quintessence models share the same problem together with an additional fine-tuning problem related to the necessity to obtain a scalar field which is light enough to drive the present epoch of accelerated expansion. In fact, why should the quintessence field be today exactly at the point where $V\simeq \Lambda^4$? Moreover, in order to have a working model, the quintessence field has to be extremely light with $m\simeq 10^{-32}$ eV. How can one make a scalar field so light? What symmetry is protecting the mass of this field?

In fact, the quintessence potential is usually given as a phenomenological construct valid at cosmological scales. In this case any quantum corrections
are also of the same order (i.e. ${O}(\Lambda^4)$ since the cutoff is of order $\Lambda$), and so will not destabilise this potential. However if one is to obtain this from some more fundamental theory at a higher scale, then this immediately faces a problem of destabilisation. This is the old problem of the cosmological constant but with an additional twist since we need to preserve not only the vacuum energy but also the running of the latter with the rolling of the quintessence field\footnote{For a detailed discussion of quantum corrections see \cite{Garny:2006wc}.}.

For instance consider a simple quintessence model with potential $V= \Lambda^4\,e^{-\chi} + m^2 \phi^2$ where $\chi$ is rolling while $\phi$ is a massive field. After integrating out the field $\phi$, which is sitting at the minimum of its potential, the quintessence model at the cutoff scale looks like:
\begin{equation}
V=\Lambda^4\, e^{- \chi}+\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\,m_\phi^4+\ldots\,.
\end{equation}
where the ellipses indicate lower order terms. In the presence of fermions, there will be corresponding negative contributions to the right-hand side but unless there is unbroken supersymmetry at these scales there will be a positive contribution that is much larger than the current cosmological constant. If one now tunes the vacuum energy (choosing $\chi=0$ at present), then to have the current value of dark energy we need: 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda^4 =-\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\,m_{\phi}^4-\ldots\,.
\end{equation}
Thus this will destabilise the potential. In general in such a model to restore the phenomenological quintessence model one would need to do functional fine-tuning. It is also possible that there are quintessence models in which the potential takes the form: 
\begin{equation}
V=\Lambda^4\, e^{- \chi}+V_0\,.
\end{equation}
In which case the quantum fluctuations of $\phi$ can be absorbed by fine tuning $V_0$. In this case we would be left just with two fine-tunings (as in generic quintessence models) i.e. one more than in generic dS models. However, in the absence of an underlying symmetry protecting the quintessence potential, it is not clear to us whether such a model (i.e. with $V_0\ne 0$ and fine tunable) can be constructed that will satisfy the conjecture of \cite{Obied:2018sgi}.

Moreover, let us point out that in a string inspired supergravity setup, after supersymmetry breaking, the corrections to the quintessence field potential would be of order $m_{3/2}^2 \Lambda_\cutoff^2$. Given that the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ sets the scale of the soft-terms, $M_{\rm soft} \sim m_{3/2}$, it cannot be smaller than the TeV scale. Since the cutoff scale $\Lambda_\cutoff$, which in 4D string models is naturally given by the Kaluza-Klein scale, has to be larger than $m_{3/2}$ in order to control the effective field theory, we conclude that the quintessence potential will generically receive corrections which cannot be smaller than (TeV)$^4$. This poses a serious challenge for any quintessence model.

\item \textit{Phenomenological problems}: The quintessence field can be either a scalar or a pseudo-scalar. If it is a pseudo-scalar like an axion, it can avoid fifth-force constraints, but a typical axion potential is flat enough to drive a period of accelerated expansion only if its decay constant is trans-Planckian \cite{Freese:1990rb}. This is in disagreement with recent studies of axion field ranges from string theory \cite{Klaewer:2016kiy, Blumenhagen:2017cxt, Palti:2017elp, Cicoli:2018tcq, Grimm:2018ohb, Heidenreich:2018kpg}. On the other hand, if the quintessence field is a scalar, it is not clear how to avoid the existing stringent bounds from fifth-forces \cite{Adelberger:2003zx}. Moreover, if the quintessence field is a string modulus which sets the visible sector gauge kinetic function, a rolling modulus would give rise to a time variation of the coupling constants. This last problem can be avoided simply by considering a modulus which is not supporting the visible sector stack of D-branes. However, evading fifth-force bounds is more complicated. The volume mode couples democratically to all fields with Planckian strength, and so it cannot be the quintessence field. This is a direct consequence of the locality of the SM construction. The fact that the volume mode has to couple to SM fields can be seen by looking at the relation between the physical Yukawa couplings $\hat{Y}_{ijk}$ and the holomorphic ones $Y_{ijk}(U)$ which depend just on the complex structure moduli because of the holomorphicity of the superpotential and the axionic shift symmetry \cite{Conlon:2006tj}:
\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_{ijk} = e^{K/2}\,\frac{Y_{ijk}(U)}{\sqrt{\tilde{K}_i \tilde{K}_j \tilde{K}_k }}\,,
\label{Yuk}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{K}_i$ is the K\"ahler metric for matter fields. Due to locality, the physical Yukawa couplings should not depend on the overall volume, and so the matter K\"ahler metric $\tilde{K}_i$ has to depend on the volume mode ${V}$ in order to cancel the powers of ${V}$ in $e^{K/2}$. Consequently, the volume mode has always a direct $M_{\rm p}$-suppressed coupling to SM-fields from expanding the matter K\"ahler metric in the kinetic terms. 

The best case scenario is therefore when the quintessence field is a modulus different from the overall volume which supports a hidden sector stack of branes, while the visible sector is localised on a blow-up mode which does not intersect with the quintessence divisor. This has been advocated in the context of swampland conjectures in \cite{Agrawal:2018own}. However even in this case, one would need to check that no interaction between the quintessence modulus and visible sector fields is induced by kinetic mixing between the moduli (see for example the moduli redefinitions in \cite{Conlon:2007gk,Cicoli:2010ha, Cicoli:2012cy} induced by non-canonical kinetic terms) or between hidden and visible sector Abelian gauge bosons \cite{Abel:2008ai, Burgess:2008ri, Goodsell:2009xc, Cicoli:2011yh}. This issue is currently under detailed investigation \cite{AMM}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The swampland and the Higgs}
\label{sec:SwampandHiggs}

As already pointed out in \cite{Denef:2018etk}, the swampland conjecture is in tension with basic features of the Higgs potential. In fact if $h$ is the standard Higgs field and $\chi$ the quintessence field, the total scalar potential can be written as:
\begin{equation}
V = \tilde{V}(h) + \hat{V} (\chi)\qquad\text{with}\qquad \tilde{V}(h) = \lambda \left(h^2-v^2\right)^2 \,.
\label{Vin}
\end{equation}
The swampland conjecture at the maximum of the Higgs potential for $h=0$ then implies:
\begin{equation}
\frac{|\nabla V|}{V}\gtrsim 1\qquad \Leftrightarrow\qquad \frac{\hat{V}_\chi(\chi)}{\tilde{V}(h) + \hat{V} (\chi)} = \frac{\hat{V}_\chi(\chi)}{\lambda v^4 + \hat{V} (\chi)} \gtrsim 1\,.
\label{NoSwamp}
\end{equation}
However the quintessence potential today has to scale as $\hat{V}(\chi_0)=\Lambda^4$. Typical quintessence potentials have the form $\hat{V}(\chi)=\Lambda^4\,e^{-\chi}$ with $\chi_0\simeq 0$. Hence $\hat{V}_\chi(\chi_0)\simeq \hat{V}(\chi_0)=\Lambda^4$, implying that the ratio in (\ref{NoSwamp}) violates the swampland conjecture by $57$ orders of magnitude!

There are several ways to cure this problem but none of them seems very natural from the string theory point of view:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Higgs as quintessence:} As a first pass at a solution one might ask whether the quintessence field can be identified with the Higgs field itself along the lines for instance of Higgs inflation, modified appropriately for quintessence. In this case at low energies (below the scale of electroweak breaking) the Higgs potential (for the neutral Higgs in unitary gauge) may acquire the form:
\begin{equation}
V = \Lambda^4 + C^4 \,e^{- k\,h/M_{\rm p}}\,.
\end{equation}
Imposing that the Higgs is rolling today at $h=v$ with values of the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon = \frac{M_{\rm p}^2}{2} \left(\frac{V_h}{V}\right)^2$ of order $1/2$ and $V \simeq \Lambda^4$ together with the right Higgs mass, one can fix the values of the parameters $C$ and $k$ at $C \simeq 10^{-52} e^{2.5\cdot 10^{71}} M_{\rm p}$ and $k=10^{88}$. Notice that this model is in agreement with observational data since, due to the huge value of $k$, one can get around $5$ efoldings of exponential expansion for $\Delta h\simeq 10^{-85.7}\,M_{\rm p}$, implying that no time-variation of the fermion masses could be observable. However the unreasonable value of $k$ and $C$ show that this is more a curious observation rather than a real solution.

\item \textbf{A direct Higgs-quintessence coupling:} Ref. \cite{Denef:2018etk} modified the initial potential (\ref{Vin}) via the introduction of a coupling between $\chi$ and $h$ of the form:
\begin{equation}
V = f(\chi) \,\tilde{V}(h) + \hat{V} (\chi)\qquad\text{with}\qquad f(\chi) = e^{-\chi} \,.
\label{Vnew}
\end{equation}
In this case the swampland conjecture is satisfied since the ratio in (\ref{NoSwamp}) at $h=0$ where $\tilde{V}_h (h)=0$ takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{f_\chi(\chi) \,\tilde{V}(h)+\hat{V}_\chi(\chi)}{f(\chi)\,\tilde{V}(h) + \hat{V} (\chi)} \simeq  \frac{f_\chi(\chi)}{f(\chi)} \simeq 1\,.
\label{YesSwamp}
\end{equation}
However, even if the Higgs-quintessence coupling in (\ref{Vnew}) is not ruled out by fifth-force constraints \cite{Denef:2018etk}, one would need to explain why the SM fermions are instead decoupled from the quintessence field since a direct coupling between them and $\chi$ would not be allowed by fifth-force bounds. Given that in 4D string models a direct coupling between $\chi$ and $h$ would generically also imply a direct coupling between the quintessence field and SM fermions, we interpret this tension as a phenomenological hint against the validity of the swampland conjecture. 

\item \textbf{Adding more fields}: Another solution involves the introduction of a third field $\phi$ which is heavy in the electroweak vacuum but makes a non-trivial contribution to the criterion at the symmetric point of the Higgs potential. Hence the potential (\ref{Vin}) gets modified to:
\begin{equation}
V = f(\phi)\,\tilde{V}(h) + g(\phi) + \hat{V} (\chi)\,.
\label{Vin2}
\end{equation}
Defining the function $y(\phi)\equiv \lambda v^4\,f(\phi) + g(\phi)$, the swampland criterion (\ref{NoSwamp}) evaluated at $h=0$ then looks like:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt{y_\phi^2(\phi)+\hat{V}_\chi^2(\chi)}}{y(\phi) + \hat{V} (\chi)} \simeq  \frac{y_\phi(\phi)}{y (\phi)} \gtrsim 1\,.
\label{NoSwamp2}
\end{equation}
Notice that $y_\phi(\phi)$ corresponds the gradient of the potential in the $\phi$ direction at the symmetric point of the Higgs potential. Thus the field $\phi$ can help to satisfy the swampland criterion if $y_\phi(\phi)\simeq y (\phi)$.

On the other hand, the same ratio evaluated at the minimum of the Higgs potential at $h=v$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt{g_\phi^2(\phi)+\hat{V}_\chi^2(\chi)}}{g(\phi) + \hat{V} (\chi)} \simeq  \frac{g_\phi(\phi)}{g (\phi)} \gtrsim 1\,.
\label{NoSwamp3}
\end{equation}
In order for $\phi$ to be stabilised at the present Higgs vacuum at $h=v$, we need also to impose that the function $g (\phi)$ admits at point in field space $\phi_0$ where $g_\phi(\phi_0) = g (\phi_0) = 0$ so that (\ref{NoSwamp}) is satisfied. Moreover, we need also to require that $f(\phi_0)=1$ in order to obtain a massive Higgs field. 

We now turn to writing down explicit models where the criterion is satisfied and point out the challenges in realising them:

\underline{Model 1:}

The simplest choices for the functions $y(\phi)$ and $g(\phi)$ satisfying the requirements (\ref{NoSwamp2}) and (\ref{NoSwamp3}) are $y(\phi)=\lambda v^4\,e^\phi$ and $g(\phi)= m^2 \Delta\phi^2$ with $\Delta\phi\equiv\phi-\phi_0$, which imply a coupling function of the form $f(\phi) = e^{\phi} - \frac{m^2}{\lambda v^4}\,\Delta\phi^2$. Notice that the potential (\ref{Vin2}) admits a point with $h$ different from either zero or $v$ where the swampland conjecture might seem to be violated since $V_\phi=V_h=0$ with positive energy. In fact, $V_h=0$ can be solved also for a negative value of $\Delta\phi$ such that $e^{\phi_0} e^{\Delta\phi} = \frac{m^2}{\lambda v^4}\,\Delta\phi^2$, and then a certain value of $h$ would solve $V_\phi=0$. However, if $\phi_0\gg 1$ and $m$ is not too large, this solution would require $|\Delta\phi|>1$, in a regime not allowed by the swampland conjecture on field distances. Notice that if the microscopic origin of the auxiliary field $\phi$ is a string modulus, we expect $\phi_0\gg 1$ in order to trust the effective field theory. As an example, consider the volume mode $\tau$ which needs to be fixed at values much larger than unity and would be related to the canonically normalised field $\phi$ by the transformation $\phi = \sqrt{\frac32} \ln\tau$. The upper bound on $m$ can be obtained by setting ${V}=\tau^{3/2}\lesssim 10^{30}$ which would correspond to TeV-scale strings. In turn, $\phi_0\lesssim 56$ which would require $m\lesssim 1$ MeV to have the extra solution discussed above at $|\Delta\phi|>1$. If we instead set ${V}\lesssim 10^{15}$ which would correspond to a TeV-scale gravitino, $\phi_0\lesssim 28$ which would require $m\lesssim 1$ eV. These values of $m$ are still large enough to be able to couple $\phi$ to both the Higgs and any SM fermion without introducing any fifth-force. Hence this solution does not feature any observational problem but does not look very appealing since it requires a particular form of the coupling function $f(\phi)$. Notice, in particular, that an order one change in the coefficient of the $\phi$-Higgs coupling proportional to $m^2$ would violate the conjecture.

\underline{Model 2:}

One could consider the more standard case where $f(\phi) =  e^{\phi}$ which implies Planck suppressed couplings between the Higgs and $\phi$ whose field range is taken to be $|\phi| < 1$ (motivated by the swampland conjecture on field ranges) with $\phi=0$ at the present vacuum. The requirement (\ref{NoSwamp2}) can still be satisfied with $y(\phi)\simeq \lambda v^4\,e^\phi$ if the function $g(\phi)$ is such that it is always subleading with respect to $\lambda v^4\,e^\phi$ for $|\phi| < 1$. This is true if $g(\phi)$ has a bounded range with a maximum and a minimum well below the electroweak scale. A simple way to realise this is if $g(\phi)$ tends to a constant value, i.e $g(\phi)$ is linear in regions away from its minimum. To analyse the case of the linear potential, we take $g(\phi) = \mu^2 \tilde{\Lambda}^2 h (\phi/ \tilde{\Lambda})$ where $h(x)$ satisfies $h(0) = h'(0) = 0$, $h''(0) = {O}(1)$, and $h(x) \sim x$ for $x \gg 1$\footnote{A function with the listed properties is $h(x) = \ln( \cosh(x))$.}. With this, the mass of $\phi$ at the $\phi=0$ minimum is of order $\mu$. The parameter $\tilde{\Lambda}$ appears in the Taylor expansion about the origin in field space. The condition (\ref{NoSwamp2}) is then satisfied if $\mu^2 \tilde{\Lambda} \ll \lambda v^4$. Taking $\tilde{\Lambda}$ to be order of $\mu$ this implies $\mu < 0.5 \,{\rm MeV} \simeq m_e$. Notice that this mass is well within the fifth force bounds if $\phi$ interacts with the entire SM sector with Planck suppressed couplings\footnote{A similar mechanism can also be implemented for the low energy QCD effective potential.}. However if in the early universe the field is displaced from its minimum, it would decay after BBN creating cosmological problems. In Appendix A we check the validity of the conjecture for all points in field space. This solution features a standard coupling function $f(\phi)=e^\phi$ but it requires $g(\phi)$ to have a particular property, i.e $g_{\phi}(\phi)$ has a bounded range with a maximum and a minimum well below the electroweak scale. This will generically imply that that the self interactions of $\phi$ are set by the very low scale $\mu$. Furthermore, from the scaling dimensions $\phi$ has the properties of a fundamental scalar and not a composite. One possibility is that the field $\phi$ is localised in a warped region. One could also think of alleviating this tension by considering potentials $g(\phi)$ in which the mass is not correlated with the asymptotic value of the energy, but this seems unnatural.

\underline{Model 3:}

Another possibility to satisfy (\ref{NoSwamp2}) is the case where the gradient of the potential along the $\phi$ direction can vanish at a point in field space if also $y(\phi)=0$ at the same point. This would correspond to the case where $y(\phi) = m^2(\phi-\mu)^2$ and $g(\phi) = m^2 \phi^2$ with $m = \sqrt{\lambda} v^2/\mu$ which implies a coupling function of the form $f(\phi) = 1-2 \frac{\phi}{\mu}$. For $\mu=M_{\rm p}$, one would recover a standard modulus with Planck suppressed interactions to matter fields. However in this case the mass of $\phi$ would need to be $m = \sqrt{\lambda} v^2/ M_{\rm p} \simeq 0.01$ meV which is too low to satisfy present fifth-force bounds \cite{Adelberger:2003zx}. Hence the scale $\mu$ has to be smaller than $M_{\rm p}$. Moreover, we stress again that ${O}(1)$ changes in the coefficients of $f(\phi)$ would invalidate this solution.
\end{itemize}
Notice that a way to address this challenge between the Higgs potential and the swampland conjecture is to modify the conjecture to allow saddle points at positive values of the potential as recently suggested in \cite{Andriot:2018wzk}. This could also take care of the recent observation regarding the existence of dS critical points associated with any supersymmetric KKLT-like AdS vacuum \cite{Conlon:2018eyr}. 

\subsubsection*{Supergravity issues}

In the previous section we discussed how to avoid a coupling between the Higgs and the quintessence field within the context of a non-supersymmetric theory. However if the 4D effective action coming from string theory is an $N=1$ supergravity  it seems hard to get the decoupled structure that we have suggested\footnote{See \cite{Denef:2018etk} for an earlier discussion on some challenges for quintessence in the context of supergravity. Our treatment is more general.}. This is a simple consequence of the fact that the potential has to be written in terms of a K\"ahler potential and a superpotential if one assumes that, after all the heavy moduli are integrated out, one still has the field content of a supergravity. We shall now consider a particular supergravity setup which seems to be the best starting point to realise a quintessence field decoupled from the Higgs, but we shall in the end show that the intrinsic nature of supergravity always induces an $M_{\rm p}$-suppressed coupling between the two fields.

In $N=1$ supergravity, the potential has the form (setting $M_{\rm p} = 1$ and ignoring D-terms which would not change our conclusion):
\begin{equation}
V(\chi,\Phi)=e^{K(\chi,\Phi)}(|D_{\chi}W|^{2}+|D_{\Phi}W|^{2}-3|W|^2) \,.
\label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
where $\chi$ is the quintessence field and $\Phi$ collectively denotes matter fields\footnote{Notice that this example does not contain the case of \cite{Cicoli:2012tz} which we shall review in Sec. \ref{sec:StringQuintessenceModels}. In this model the quintessence field $\chi$, being a K\"ahler modulus orthogonal to the volume mode, does not appear in the tree-level K\"ahler potential. This is a key feature to guarantee the absence of $M_{\rm p}$-suppressed couplings of $\chi$ to SM fields.}. In this context the most one can do to isolate the quintessence field $\phi$ from matter fields i.e. supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) fields and all other matter fields (BSM, moduli, dark matter) $\Phi$ is to write:
\begin{eqnarray}
K & = & K_{q}(\chi)+K_{m}(\Phi),\label{eq:K}\\
W & = & W_{q}(\chi)+W_{m}(\Phi).\label{eq:W}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $W_q(\chi),W_m(\Phi)$ are the quintessence and MSSM superpotentials. Since the K\"ahler metric is block diagonal we can take $\chi$ to be canonically normalised i.e. $K_q=\chi\bar{\chi}$ without affecting the other fields. To ensure that a quintessence potential of the form $V\sim\Lambda e^{-\beta\chi_{R}}$ (where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant today) is obtained we need $W_q=\frac{2}{\beta}\sqrt{\Lambda}e^{-\frac12 \beta\chi}$. 

The supergravity expression for the potential then gives a coupling between the MSSM potential and the quintessence field of the form (restoring $M_{\rm p}$):
\begin{equation}
\delta V\sim\delta e^{K_q}|D_\Phi W|^{2}\sim\frac{\bar{\chi}_{0}}{M_{\rm p}^2}\delta\chi|D_\Phi W|^2.
\label{eq:qhiggs}
\end{equation}
There is a similar coupling to fermions of the form: 
\begin{equation}
\delta{\cal L}\sim\delta e^{K_{q}/2}{\cal L}_{{\rm fermion}}\sim\frac{\chi_0}{M_{\rm p}^2}\delta\chi \, {\cal L}_{{\rm fermion}} \,.
\label{eq:qfermi}
\end{equation}

Also due to the Weyl anomaly there is a K\"ahler potential dependent correction to the physical (Einstein frame) gauge coupling:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\rm phys}^2}=\Re f-\frac{3T(G)}{16\pi^2} \, K|_0,
\end{equation}
(here $T(G)$ is a group theory number) giving similarly a quintessence dependence to the gauge field kinetic terms of the form:
\begin{equation}
\delta{\cal L}\sim-\frac{3T(G)}{16\pi^{2}}\frac{\chi_{0}}{M_{\rm p}^2}\delta\chi \, {\cal {\cal L}}_{{\rm gauge}}.
\label{eq:qgauge}
\end{equation}
By choosing the value of the quintessence field $\chi$ today to be $\chi_0=0$ one can of course avoid fifth-force bounds today. However, for a quintessence potential of the form $\hat{V}(\chi) = \Lambda^4 e^{-k \chi}$ with $k \simeq {O}(1)$, the quintessence field is expected to move a distance $\Delta\phi\sim {O}(1) M_{\rm p}$ and so at some point before the transition in the past to a matter/radiation dominated phase one would have had $\chi_{0}\sim {O}(1) M_{\rm p}$. In this case we would have Planck suppressed linear couplings of the quintessence field for which there are strong bounds. 

Thus we have to conclude that at scales where the type of model such as that given in (\ref{Vin2}) is valid (and gives a quintessence model with no fifth-force issues) supersymmetry is badly broken. In other words the field content at these scales are not those of a supersymmetric theory\footnote{While this paper was being prepared for publication the paper \cite{Chiang:2018jdg} appeared which constructed two supergravity quintessence models. The first is an axionic model which we have argued would not be compatible with string theory expectations. The second model and its analysis appears to be consistent with our arguments above. We would also like to point out that the fact that a generic supergravity leads to a quintessence field with a mass equal to that of the gravitino can be avoided by having a term $m_q M_{\rm p} \chi$ in $W_q(\chi)$ and fine-tuning $m_q$ to cancel the term proportional to $m_{3/2}$.}.



\subsection{String quintessence models}
\label{sec:StringQuintessenceModels}

Candidates for quintessence fields can be naturally searched in the vast moduli sector of string compactifications. The first natural candidates that can be thought of are the overall volume and the dilaton since they are model independent. They may be rolling towards the infinite volume or zero coupling limit or towards a local minimum corresponding to dS or AdS. However they both couple to all matter fields and then the strong bounds on fifth-forces and varying constants would make this option untenable.

More promising models involve instead moduli which control the sizes of cycles hosting hidden sector branes and can in principle be a quintessence candidate. This is the case for the model considered in \cite{Cicoli:2012tz} which is based on an LVS string embedding with stabilised moduli \cite{Cicoli:2011yy} of the 6D Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimension (SLED) proposal \cite{Aghababaie:2003wz}. In this case low-scale gravity is used to address the hierarchy problem whereas supersymmetry is exploited to protect the quintessence potential from receiving dangerously large corrections. In fact, TeV-scale strings correlates with a gravitino mass of order the meV-scale. Notice that in these constructions supersymmetry is only non-linearly realised on the SM brane, and so $m_{3/2}$ is decoupled from the mass of the supersymmetric particles which is instead around the string scale. Moreover, in the presence of just two large extra dimensions, the Kaluza-Klein scale also reduces to the meV-scale. Hence corrections to the quintessence potential from loops of bulk fields of order $m_{3/2}^2 \Lambda_\cutoff^2$ scale as $({\rm meV})^4$, showing that supersymmetry is the symmetry which makes this quintessence model natural, similarly to the model of \cite{Albrecht:2001xt}. 

The difference between the two models is that in \cite{Albrecht:2001xt} the quintessence field is the overall volume mode which suffers from problems associated with the mediation of unobserved fifth-forces. On the other hand, in the string model of \cite{Cicoli:2012tz}, the quintessence field is a fibre modulus with a weaker-than-Planckian coupling to SM fields which does not give rise to any problem with fifth-forces. The reason for this small coupling is two-fold: ($i$) the SM is localised on a blow-up cycle which has no intersection with the fibre divisor and ($ii$) since the fibre divisor is a leading order flat direction, there is no leading order mixing between the quintessence field and the volume mode which can induce a Planck-strength coupling with SM fields. The main challenges of this model are the need to develop a proper 6D understanding since the gravitino mass is of order the Kaluza-Klein scale, together with the need to perform a detailed analysis of any correction which can induce a direct $M_{\rm p}$-suppressed coupling between the fibre divisor and SM fields. One should also carefully check that, according to the SLED proposal \cite{Aghababaie:2003wz}, loops of brane states are indeed cancelled by backreaction effects. 

Other quintessence candidates are the axionic partners of the moduli which have an approximate shift that protects their couplings \cite{Kaloper:2008qs,Panda:2010uq, Choi:1999xn}. Having compact support, the potential for these fields has to have a minimum. In order to perform a proper study of the implications for quintessence, they have to be considered within a full moduli stabilisation mechanism\footnote{See for instance the discussion in \cite{Panda:2010uq}.}. However, as mentioned above, one generically needs trans-Planckian axionic decay constants to drive a period of accelerated expansion \cite{Freese:1990rb} while recent studies of axion field ranges in string theory showed that this is very hard to achieve \cite{Klaewer:2016kiy, Blumenhagen:2017cxt, Palti:2017elp, Cicoli:2018tcq, Grimm:2018ohb, Heidenreich:2018kpg}.
 
A typical criticism of having a rolling scalar field in string compactifications with moduli stabilisation is that there is need for a double tuning, first the overall value of the cosmological constant and second the slope of the rolling field, both independently small numbers. However in LVS the axion partner of the volume modulus is a natural candidate for quintessence since its mass is of order $m\sim {O}(e^{-{V}^{2/3}})$ and the volume exponentially large. For volumes of order ${V}\sim 10^3-10^5$ for which the string scale is of order GUT scale, the axion masses can be as small as $m\sim 10^{-32}$ eV  \cite{us}. In order to build a concrete model, one should check however that the axionic potential is flat enough to drive the present acceleration of our universe for a sub-Planckian decay constant. Furthermore any modulus that is stabilised by perturbative effects (by a combination of $\alpha'$ and loop effects) has a corresponding axionic partner with a mass which is doubly exponentially suppressed. It is then natural to have several candidates for dark energy but also for ultra-light axion dark matter. Notice that these fields can also give rise to condensates (axion stars) with masses of order $M_{\rm star}\sim M_{\rm p}^2/m$ which can be as heavy as $10^{20}$ solar masses \cite{Hui:2016ltb, Marsh:2015xka, Krippendorf:2018tei}. Moreover, as we shall show in Sec. \ref{sec:LowRedshift}, notice that ultra-light axions oscillating around a minimum with positive vacuum energy can induce an oscillating equation of state parameter which yields a small modification of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.



\subsection{String axion quintessence}
\label{sec:LowRedshift}

We will consider now in more detail what in our opinion are the most promising candidates for a dynamical field for dark energy: string axions.

One of the most generic predictions of string theory is the existence of a \textit{string axiverse}~\cite{Svrcek:2006yi, Arvanitaki:2009fg, Cicoli:2012sz}, i.e. a large number of axions arising upon Kaluza-Klein reduction of the antisymmetric form fields on the internal cycles of the compactification space. The number of axions is related to the number of cycles in the compactification space and can easily be of ${O}\left(100\right)$ or larger. Various non-perturbative corrections can give a mass to such fields, roughly of order $m_a \sim e^{-\tau}\,M_{\rm p}$, where $\tau$ is the corresponding saxion whose value parametrises the size of the cycle supporting non-perturbative effects. As $\tau$ can be rather large, i.e. much larger than the values needed to trust the effective field theory, the axion mass can easily be very small, as required for quintessence. Moreover, if the saxions receive a mass from perturbative effects, the low-energy EFT includes only the ultra-light axions. Concrete examples that feature all these properties are LVS models which admit at least one ultra-light axion corresponding to the axionic partner of the overall volume mode (which is stabilised perturbatively) with mass \cite{Conlon:2005ki, Cicoli:2017zbx}: 
\begin{equation} 
m_a \simeq \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{8\pi}}\,\frac{M_{\rm p}}{{V}^{2/3}}\,e^{-\frac{\pi}{N} {V}^{2/3}} M_{\rm p} \,,
\end{equation}
which can be in the right range for example for $g_s=0.1$, $N=3$ ($N$ is the rank of the condensing gauge group) and ${V}=1400$ as required to match the observed amplitude of the density perturbation in fibre inflation models \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. LVS models with more than one large cycle would feature more ultra-light axionic candidates for explaining dark energy (as in the case of fibred CY threefolds where the fibre moduli are stabilised perturbatively and the corresponding axions remain light \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}). Another positive property of axions is that they feature a shift-symmetry at the perturbative level that naturally prevents their potential to acquire large quantum corrections. Finally ultra-light axions, being pseudo-scalars, can easily evade existing constraints from fifth-forces. For these reasons, axions are arguably one of the best candidate fields for quintessence in string theory. In this section we briefly review how axions can give rise to an accelerated late-time expansion of the universe.

In a moduli stabilisation scenario such as LVS we can separate the moduli between those that are stabilised by non-perturbative effects (such as blow-up modes) and those that are stabilised by perturbative effects (such as the overall volume and many fibre moduli). For the first group both the modulus and its corresponding axion get mass of the same order $m_a\sim m_{3/2}$. For the second group, the axions are much lighter than the moduli and we can study the EFT only for these ultra-light axions after integrating out all other massive fields. Since most known CY manifolds have a fibration structure, the number $N_\ULA$ of ultra-light axions can be very large ($N_\ULA\sim{O}(100)$). To leading order in the non-perturbative expansion this axion potential takes the form\footnote{For potential generalisations of this scalar potential see for instance \cite{Bachlechner:2017zpb}.}:
\begin{equation}
V=\Lambda^4-\sum_{i=1}^{N_\ULA} \Lambda_i^4 \cos\left(\frac{a_i}{f_i}\right) + \cdots \,,
\label{eq:AxionPotential}
\end{equation}
where $f_i$ is the axion decay constant of the $i$-th canonically normalised axion field $a_i$, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant scale that can be tuned by fluxes and $\Lambda_i$ is the scale of the non-perturbative effect that gives mass to the $i$-th axion. In string compactifications the axion decay constant is roughly given by $f_i \simeq M_{\rm p}/ \tau_i < M_{\rm p}$ for $\tau_i >1$ \cite{Svrcek:2006yi, Arvanitaki:2009fg, Cicoli:2012sz}. For a quintessence candidate we need the slow-roll condition $\epsilon=\frac{M_{\rm p}^2}{2} \left(\frac{V'}{V}\right )^2 < 1$ to be satisfied. The scalar potential in \eqref{eq:AxionPotential} has a minimum at $\langle V\rangle = \Lambda^4-\sum_i\Lambda_i^4$ and a maximum at $V_{\rm max}=\Lambda^4+\sum_i\Lambda_i^4$ with  inflection points at $V_{\rm infl}=\Lambda^4$ as well as many ($2^{N_\ULA-1}$) saddle points. In phenomenological and cosmological discussions it is usually assumed that the minimum is tuned to zero but this is not natural in the landscape since the tuning for the overall minimum is not necessarily related with the scales of each the $\Lambda_i$'s. Therefore we may study different possibilities in particular for $\Lambda$ greater, smaller or of the same order as the smallest $\Lambda_i$.

Depending on the values of $\tau_i$ and the coefficients of the non-perturbative effects, the corresponding axions can also be integrated out until we reach the lightest one, that we denote with $a_\ell$. Focusing for simplicity on $a_\ell$, the corresponding slow-roll condition is:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac12 \left[\left(\frac{\Lambda_\ell}{\Lambda}\right)^4\frac{M_{\rm p}}{f_{\ell}}\right]^2 \frac{\sin^2\left(a_\ell/f_{\ell}\right)}{\left(1 - \left(\Lambda_{\ell}/\Lambda\right)^4 \cos\left(a_\ell/f_\ell\right)\right)^2} < 1 \,.
\label{eq:epsilon}
\end{equation}
However, before integrating out the heavier axions, the original potential can give rise to interesting early universe cosmology. In particular, as the universe evolves and the Hubble parameter decreases, each axion field is essentially frozen at its value after inflation due to the large Hubble friction. Once the Hubble scale hits the mass threshold of a given axion, the axion  starts to roll and oscillates around its minimum. Depending on the relative values of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_i$ as well as the initial value of the field, the slow roll condition may or may not be satisfied.

Depending on the values of different constants we will have distinctive scenarios which we now state:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Alignment mechanism}: If the minimum of the potential is tuned to be at vanishing energy (i.e. if $\Lambda = \Lambda_\ell$) as is usually done in the literature, we can observe from eq. \eqref{eq:epsilon} that in order to get an accelerated expansion of the universe the axion decay constant has to be $f_\ell \gtrsim M_{\rm p}$. Getting a (super-)Planckian axion decay constant is a well-known issue in string theory since it is in tension with the fact that the cycles volumes are expected to be larger than the string scale ($\tau_\ell\gtrsim 1$). However there might be possible way-outs that rely on alignment mechanisms involving two~\cite{Kim:2004rp, Shiu:2015xda} or many fields~\cite{Dimopoulos:2005ac, Cicoli:2014sva}.

\item \textbf{Hilltop quintessence}: As explained above, the generic situation is to have axions with sub-Planckian decay constants. In this case, even if $\Lambda = \Lambda_\ell$, the axion $a_\ell$ could still drive the present epoch of accelerated expansion without the need to rely on complicated misalignment-like mechanisms. In fact, if the maximum of the potential for $a_\ell$ is located at positive energy (i.e. $\Lambda^4 + \Lambda_i^4 > 0$), as in the two examples reported in Fig. \ref{fig:potentials}, and the field is initially displaced close to it, the universe undergoes accelerated expansion~\cite{Kamionkowski:2014zda}. Notice that in order for this mechanism to work, the minimum of the potential does not need to be tuned to $0$: the crucial point is just that a region of the potential around the maximum is at positive energy. Moreover, axion fields are very light, and so it is very easy to displace them from their minima, e.g. during inflation. Given the large number of ultra-light axions in generic string compactifications, we expect that the displacement of these fields is evenly distributed in the range $a_i/f_i \in [-\pi,\pi]$, and so it should not be difficult to find one of them around its maximum. We stress that this case would be the only way to get axion inflation when $f_\ell < M_{\rm p}$ even if the initial position of the axion has to be tuned extremely close to the maximum to obtain enough efoldings of inflation \cite{BlancoPillado:2004ns}.

\item \textbf{Quasi-natural quintessence}: Notice that in the landscape there is no reason to tune the minimum to vanishing vacuum energy. If the minimum of the potential for the lightest axion is tuned to be of the order of the current value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, the slow-roll condition just implies (the term which depends on $a_\ell/f_\ell$ in eq. \eqref{eq:epsilon} is always smaller than $1$):
\begin{equation}
f_{\ell}\gtrsim \left(\frac{\Lambda_\ell}{\Lambda}\right)^4\,M_{\rm p}\,,
\label{eq:IPQ}
\end{equation}
which allows for a sub-Planckian axion decay constant $f_\ell<M_{\rm p}$ as long as $\Lambda \gg \Lambda_\ell$. The slow-roll condition $\epsilon<1$ is naturally satisfied for a very large region of field space, not only close to the hilltop as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:IPQ}). The corresponding equation of state would give a small modification to the cosmological constant scenario:
\begin{equation}
w=\frac{p}{\rho}=\frac{\frac{{\dot a}^2}{2}-V}{\frac{{\dot a}^2}{2}+V}\sim -\frac{1-\frac13 \epsilon}{1+\frac13 \epsilon}\sim -1 + \frac{2}{3}\epsilon \,.
\end{equation}
It is worth mentioning that the case $\Lambda \gg \Lambda_\ell$ is never considered for inflation since the energy scale of the potential would be of order the cosmological constant scale, and so would be way too low to match the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. Moreover, for $\Lambda \gg \Lambda_\ell$, if $f_\ell$ is not too low, $\epsilon$ is below unity everywhere in the axion field space, and so there would be no way to end inflation.

\item \textbf{Oscillating scalar}: Another possible modification of the constant dark energy scenario could be given by an oscillating axion. Assuming that $\Lambda$ is tuned at the current value of the cosmological constant as in the left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:Oscillating-wt} and that $a_\ell$ is initially displaced from its minimum, the field starts oscillating around its minimum when $H$ is of order of its mass. This will then produce an interesting oscillating equation of state, as shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:Oscillating-wt} for $f/M_{\rm p} = 1$ and $\Lambda_\ell/\Lambda =0.85$. This expected behaviour could be used to study the existence of axions with mass of the same order of $H_0$, comparing with low-redshift observations.

Notice that cases ($3$) and ($4$) necessarily violate the swampland conjecture (\ref{eq:SwamplandConjecture}) since they require dS minima, while case ($1$) would violate the swampland conjecture on field distances \cite{Ooguri:2006in} since it requires trans-Planckian physics. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:potentials}, case ($2$) just requires the presence of a maximum at positive energy but it would work also for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. Hence this case would violate the swampland conjecture (\ref{eq:SwamplandConjecture}) but it would still be allowed by a refined conjecture which does not exclude dS maxima \cite{Andriot:2018wzk}.

Considerations of ultra-light axions corresponding to a quintessence field have been made in several recent studies \cite{Kamionkowski:2014zda, Karwal:2016vyq,Poulin:2018dzj}. The fact that there may be many axions dominating the energy density at different stages of the evolution of the universe may be a way to address the apparent discrepancy among the different measurements of $H$ at high and low redshift. Their considerations can be adapted to the present discussion but with the difference that we do not assume the minimum of the potential to vanish. 

In summary string theory axions provide  interesting candidates to be quintessence for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ultra-light axions are a natural outcome of moduli stabilisation scenarios with exponentially suppressed masses. 

\item Depending on the value of these masses, the axions can be ultra light dark matter or dark energy.

\item These ultra-light axions are also natural candidates for dark radiation produced after the decay of the corresponding modulus field \cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Angus:2014bia, Hebecker:2014gka, Cicoli:2015bpq} which can put constraints on string scenarios but also can partially address cosmological issues such as the tension between high and low redshift measurements of the Hubble parameter by increasing the value of $N_{\rm eff}$ \cite{Riess:2016jrr}\footnote{Notice however that larger values of $N_{\rm eff}$, even if they decrease the tension between different determinations of $H_0$, increase the existing tension between different measurements of the $\sigma_8$ parameter.}.

\item The fact that there may be hundreds or thousands of ultra-light axions can give rise to interesting cosmological periods in early universe cosmology with also potential implications for different measurements of $H$.

\item If the overall minimum of the potential is not tuned at zero several scenarios emerge with accelerating universes. A negative vacuum energy is allowed if slow-roll starts close to a maximum or a saddle point at positive $V$ and the slow-roll condition can be easily satisfied with no trans-Planckian decay constant as long as $\Lambda \gg \Lambda_\ell$. The different axions oscillating around their minima do not risk overclosing the universe since the minimum is not at zero. An oscillating scalar around a minimum with positive vacuum energy can give rise to a varying equation of state. The time in which the field climbs the potential may mimic $w<-1$ as suggested in \cite{Csaki:2005vq}. However, reproducing the recent analysis, which suggests a turning point for the Hubble parameter \cite{Wang:2018fng, Capozziello:2018jya, Dutta:2018vmq}, remains a theoretical challenge if these results were confirmed.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we have analysed general aspects regarding dS and quintessence scenarios to have a concrete realisation in effective field theories derived from string compactifications. 

We have seen that even though in order to have full control of dS moduli stabilisation a non-perturbative formulation of string theory is needed, there has been substantial progress in the past decades to be confident that these solutions do exist and that the string theory landscape is a generic outcome of string theory. It is actually remarkable that, without having a full non-perturbative formulation of the theory and not knowing even the metric of the extra dimensional manifolds, there is a coherent picture in which all moduli are stabilised and dS space in 4D can appear as a solution. 

It is worth emphasising that this procedure uses explicit string theory features with solid mathematical structures such as the topological properties of the compact space, warping induced by fluxes, tadpole cancellation conditions, brane and anti-brane dynamics, explicit computations of leading order perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the effective field theory, etc. It is fair to say that a full control is difficult to achieve with our current understanding of string compactifications which are not  maximally supersymmetric but not having full control on the calculations should not be confused with  having no control at all. The results are based on well defined approximations which are justified as long as the couplings are weak and the volumes are large enough. Luckily this is the regime that is also interesting for phenomenological applications\footnote{Notice that the challenge to obtain proper inflationary models from string theory with large tensor modes is mostly due to the fact that, if these modes were observable, the corresponding EFT would be at the edge of its validity.}.

We have also seen that the natural alternative to dS space, quintessence, can also be accommodated in string compactifications albeit in a more complicated way. Having a rolling direction which is flat enough to give rise to the observed dark energy requires all other moduli to be stabilised in a similar way as in dS compactifications or rolling even more slowly, something which is more challenging than getting dS. Typical candidates for the quintessence field such as the overall volume and the dilaton are not appropriate to be the quintessence field since they couple to all matter in hidden and observable sectors, and so would be subject to stringent fifth-force constraints \cite{Adelberger:2003zx}. On the other hand, moduli associated with cycles hosting only hidden sector fields \cite{Cicoli:2012tz} may still be allowed by observational constraints although that may require a very small string scale. A low string scale has also appeared in efforts to construct quintessence models in warped throats \cite{Panda:2010uq}.

We also studied the nature of the Higgs couplings to various fields in light of the swampland conjectures. We have found that a direct coupling between the Higgs and the quintessence field can be avoided if there are other fields which give non-trivial contributions to $\nabla V$ at the symmetric point of the Higgs potential. However such realisations seem difficult to realise from the point of view of string theory. 

We have also analysed the possibility of quintessence in the context of supergravity and illustrated the presence of generic couplings (including one loop effects) between all fermions and the quintessence field, which are in tension with the observational bounds. Moreover, analysis of renormalisation group effects showed the requirement of functional fine-tuning of the tree-level potential of the quintessence field or at least additional fine-tuning compared to dS models.

The best candidates of quintessence fields are the multiple axions that abound in string compactifications. Considering them just as rolling quintessence fields is a very limited option. However since they correspond to periodic fields with a compact support, their scalar potential has to have a minimum. A natural possibility is that these fields may be oscillating around a dS minimum giving rise to a small modification of the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.  

It is important to notice that in general some of the K\"ahler moduli obtain mass via perturbative effects. This implies that the corresponding axions, which get lifted only by non-perturbative effects, are much lighter yielding a large mass hierarchy among the two components of the same complex scalar field. This is precisely the case for the overall volume modulus and  fibration moduli in LVS models. It is worth emphasising that having an extremely light axion is the most model-independent prediction of LVS constructions. Having fibre moduli is also very generic. It is then possible to have one of the axions to correspond to ultra light dark matter with a mass of order $10^{-22}$ eV and another to provide dark energy with a mass of order $10^{-32}$ eV. Furthermore both can be candidates to be part of dark radiation for which there are strong constraints. This justifies a more detailed study of the cosmological implications of these light axions.

It would be highly desirable to count on a non-perturbative formulation of string theory that could hopefully determine once and for all that there are or not dS or quintessence solutions of string theory (as it would also be good to have a full proof of the AdS/CFT correspondence or the finiteness of string theory or any potential alternative). As usual in science we have to content ourselves to extract information based on limited experimental input  and theoretical control. In the Standard Model we have experimental data which we can confront whereas string constructions cannot at the moment be discriminated on the basis of observations. In the case of dS vs quintessence we hope we have argued that the theoretical progress made over the years, although not $100\%$ satisfactory, is encouraging and present a coherent picture. Furthermore, experimentally, the fact that the equation of state $w$ has been converging over the years towards $w=-1$ is tantalising to bend the preference in favour of dS, following standard Bayesian criteria. However, the recent tension among values of the Hubble parameter determined from high and low redshift may hint at a variable equation of state that could be at odds with both dS and quintessence (see for instance \cite{Wang:2018fng, Capozziello:2018jya, Dutta:2018vmq}). Even though it is too early to judge the robustness of this analysis we have to keep an open mind. Low redshift measurements have surprised us already once, against our theoretical prejudices, and may do it again. 
 
Finally we would like to remark that it is healthy to challenge the different approaches to obtain dS space in a fundamental theory. Having criticism and skepticism to a concrete scientific development helps to sharpen the arguments and clarify the achievements and open questions. In view of the lack of further experimental input, this is the best avenue to address theoretical questions and converge towards the best possible explanations. In the case of dS vacua, the question is of utmost importance and  having an open debate helps to streamline all the arguments and eventually improve the existing constructions to make them more explicit and coherent or even rule them out. Given the importance of the question being addressed, a high level of scrutiny of the solutions is important -- in fact no bar is too high a bar. We hope to come back and address some of the open questions highlighted in this article.

\section{Introduction}
The modern era of the physical description of nature is built upon a very fundamental realization starting with Galilei's and Newton's work -- namely that the dynamical laws of nature are given in general by systems of coupled Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (ODEs and PDEs), that is the laws are \emph{local} in space-time. Since then, it is also clear that describing the state of a physical system and/or predicting its time evolution into the future requires specifying appropriate boundary and/or initial conditions, and then solving the PDEs on the relevant spatial or space-time domain. 

Attempting to do so shows very quickly, that finding exact analytical solutions for any situation involving more than a few degrees of freedom of the system in question becomes prohibitively difficult in most cases. Therefore, solving PDEs for most problems became critically dependent on developing approximation schemes relying on discretizing space-time and converting the PDEs in finite-difference equations, which can then be solved \emph{algorithmically} in an iterating series of steps. This process eventually led to the development of finite-difference and finite-element method (FD/FEM) based discretized integrators.
These discrete methods of integrating ODEs and PDEs were developed into standardized software packages being able to produce numerical adaptively discretized solutions to ODEs and PDEs with controllable approximation errors for many types of ODEs and PDEs from physics and mathematics. From hereon, we will use FD/FEM to summarily denote both the PDE solvers as well as the ODE solvers. 

Finite difference methods are clearly more straightforward to be implemented. This is the main reason why they are widespread in the scientific community, see for instance~\cite{Felder_2008, Frolov_2008, Sainio:2009hm, Huang:2011gf, Sainio:2012mw, Child:2013ria, Clough:2015sqa, Mewes_2018, Giblin:2019nuv, Vogelsberger:2019ynw} for some examples of early universe, general relativity and large scale structure simulations. On the other hand finite difference methods do not work well if the domain is irregular, which is a standard situation in many engineering contexts, in which one has to deal for instance with structural analysis of buildings or deformation and stresses of solid bodies. There is a number of finite element based softwares available on the market, such as~\cite{Mathematica, MATLAB:2010, multiphysics1998introduction} and a few open source ones~\cite{maple, bastian2020dune, AlnaesBlechta2015a, mfem}. Both finite element and finite difference methods achieve outstanding results in terms of accuracy, but share a few shortcomings: first, the discretization is unavoidably a source of error. This problem can be cured in most situations by improving the precision of the solver, i.e. increasing the number of points in the grid for the finite difference methods and refining the mesh and/or choosing a basis of higher order polynomials to approximate the solution in the finite element case. Of course, this comes at the cost of larger simulation times. However, the second and probably most important problem of these methods is that they are very memory expensive, as the amount of information to be stored at any time is proportional to the number of points in the grid for finite difference methods, and proportional to the number of elements of the mesh for finite element methods. Sometimes, this comes at the expense of not being able to use faster processors, e.g. GPUs instead of CPUs, to perform large simulations. 

More fundamentally, the approximation quality of FEM integrators depends on the cleverness of the chosen higher-order discretization schemes of the solving function and its space-time derivatives entering the given ODE/PDE as well as the choice of the interpolating functions used to improve the discretized integration method. While they have become quite good, they were developed by humans based on certain criteria and motivations, which prevent these methods from being adapted from the ground up to the specific ODE/PDE in question. Instead, the methods developed for the FD/FEM paradigm have a given fixed algorithmic form but are set up to deliver reasonably accurate solutions to many ODEs/PDEs.

Thus, it is conceivable to achieve a potentially significant improvement over the FD/FEM solvers, if the functional form of the approximation algorithm itself could become dynamically adaptable to each given ODE/PDE at hand. For human programmers this would imply to re-invent a new FD/FEM algorithm each time -- hence it is here where the specific properties of machine learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs) become useful. Based on the universal approximation theorem~\cite{cybenko1989approximation, HORNIK1991251, pinkus_1999}, a DNN can act as a universal regressor which is able to represent any bounded continuous function, given suitable discretized training data, without pre-specifying a human-developed symbolic algorithm discretizing the function. 

\subsection{Relevant literature}
\label{sec:Literature}

The interplay between neural networks and differential equations presumably started back in the early '90s, when an algorithm based on the Hopfield network combined with finite difference methods was proposed in~\cite{Lee1990NeuralAF}. The idea to use a deep neural networks was then put forward in~\cite{Lagaris_1998, 870037, Lagaris:1997ap} in the second half of the '90s. The idea of these papers was very simple: a neural network can be used to approximate a function as well as its derivatives, and it can be trained in order to minimize a loss function vanishing when the PDE is solved. At that time, backpropagation was not widespread yet, hence the authors had to restrict to a quite simple architecture with a single hidden layer, in order to be able to compute derivatives analytically.

From here it is short step to the PINN, introduced in 2017 by~\cite{raissi2017physics_1,raissi2017physics_2} -- the physics-informed neural network. The idea is simple -- you use the learning and approximating power of the DNN to adjust the learned function until it satisfies a given ODE or PDE precisely enough. This is achieved by using the square of the differential equation itself, evaluated on the DNN output (its best guess of the function at a given algorithmic step called `epoch'), as the `bulk' loss function whose gradients then tell the DNN how to adjust its weights using backpropagation. The full loss function here contains separate pieces which enforce a solution of the PDE in the bulk space-time as well as fulfillment of the initial and boundary conditions determining the solution. Such a PINN will in principle learn an optimized approximate solution of the ODE/PDE given to it, instead of using a fixed symbolically prescribed `one-size-fits-all' algorithm. 

This may lead to gains in the approximation quality and/or efficiency of the dynamically learned algorithm compared to pre-fixed algorithm, and has the potential to become highly memory-conserving. A PINN, once trained to solve a given ODE/PDE only needs to store the architecture of its DNN and its trained weight system (one set of float valued matrices). On the other hand, a conventional solver has to build the discretized function system and its derived higher-order interpolating functions and, moreover, needs to maintain this information in memory during work 

An interesting alternative approach to PINNs, named the CINT (from Constrained Integration) algorithm, was proposed in 2014 in~\cite{rudd2013constrained, RUDD2015277}, based on a combination of the CPROP algorithm~\cite{ferrari2008} with Galerkin methods~\cite{galerkin1915electrical, michlin1962variationsmethoden, vajnberg1973variational}.  The CINT algorithm was shown to successfully solve the wave and heat equation, and achieves very good results both in terms of speed and accuracy. 

We now return to a closer discussion of the PINN. As already mentioned, the loss function of a PINN contains several pieces, which separately enforce the PDE solution in the bulk and its initial and boundary conditions. Using rather large networks (such as for instance a 9-layers NN containing 20 units for each layers for the Burgers' equation, for a total of more than 3000 parameters), the authors of~\cite{raissi2017physics_1} achieved quite good results, reaching a loss $< 10^{-3}$ for a variety of PDEs, such as the Burgers'  and the Schr\"odinger equations in $1+1$D. 

A more sophisticated architecture was proposed under the name of \textit{Deep Galerkin Method} (DGM) in 2018 in~\cite{Sirignano_2018} with the aim of solving high-dimensional PDEs. The architecture is reminiscent of LSTM models, and is designed to successfully detect sharp turns and in the solution. The DGM architecture makes use of distributed training and a Monte-Carlo method for the computation of second derivatives to solve various high-dimensional (up to 200 dimensions) PDEs such as the Burgers' equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

More recently, various packages exploiting these ideas have been put forward. For instance, \textit{DeepXDE} introduces a residual-based adaptive refinement of the grid in order to improve the training efficiency of PINNs~\cite{lu2020deepxde}. DeepXDE is shown to successfully solve PDEs that are first order in time derivative as well as integro-differential equations and inverse problems. Very nicely, the DeepXDE Python library can be easily adapted to work on non-trivial domain shapes. On the other hand, \textit{Pydens}~\cite{koryagin2019pydens} is a Python library that allows to solve a large family of PDEs including the wave equation and the heat equation, and gives the possibility to easily switch between standard architectures (such as ResNet and DenseNet).

Beyond the ideas mentioned above, there are many more that would need to be mentioned, including: the use of adaptive activation functions to accelerate the convergence of PINNs~\cite{jagtap2020adaptive, jagtap2020locally}, the use of convolutional neural networks to solve PDEs or to address the inverse problem~\cite{tompson2017accelerating, Geneva_2020, Thuerey_2020}, adversarial training techniques~\cite{Yang_2019}, energy based approaches~\cite{Samaniego_2020}, the use of random approximation methods~\cite{E_2017, chaudhari2017deep, Beck_2019, fujii2019asymptotic}. Note that it has been estimated that techniques based on PINNs might become competitive with standard methods such as finite difference~\cite{avrutskiy2020neural}. See also~\cite{dockhorn2019discussion} for a recent discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using neural network based techniques for solving PDEs and about the possible routes forward in this direction.



\subsection{Our contribution}

At the moment though, we are not able to find a single implementation of the PINN or any of the other ideas that is capable of solving a large class of ODEs and PDEs with good accuracy and without the need to finely tune the hyperparameters of the network. By `large class of ODEs and PDEs’ we mean to include not only the simplest, mandatory examples, such as the wave equation, the heat equation and the Poisson equation, but also more complex examples that include for instance damped oscillations and stiff equations. 

The crucial idea we report here, which makes the PINN more efficient to use for solving many different ODEs/PDEs, is to develop a DNN architecture which optimizes the set of functions used in the DNN's exploitation of the universal function theorem. Namely, we first observe that bounded solutions of any ODE/PDE can in principle be decomposed into any given complete orthonormal function system. Fourier decomposition and the softened-bin decomposition of a function, used to prove the universal approximation theorem for feed-forward DNNs, are two examples. 

In our experience in physics, the various types of dynamics shown by ODE and PDE solutions, the resulting function very often is composed out of a secular non-oscillatory part, and a part which is a Fourier synthesis of various oscillatory components. While it is possible to approximate a secular slow-changing function solely by Fourier synthesis, doing so requires summing over a very large number of Fourier modes to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Conversely, approximating an oscillatory function over many periods using the softened-bin decomposition requires summing up a very large number of narrow bins. Both decompositions are possible, although inefficient, for the each of two the respective cases. 

Hence, for achieving a given approximation quality, we expect it to be much more efficient, to use both the secular behaviour of the function system used to build the softened-bin decomposition and Fourier decomposition -- the first to efficiently approximate the secular components of a function, the second to model its oscillatory components. Such a `two-stream' decomposition will likely require far fewer terms/modes to approximate a function to given finite accuracy, than each of the two decomposition streams by itself. For a similar approach in the context of time-series analises, see for instance~\cite{TimeSeries}.

Therefore, we propose \textsf{dNNsolve}: the `two-stream' decomposition into the DNN of the PINN by splitting some of the hidden layers into two parts whose choice of activation function is suitable for the non-oscillatory secular decomposition in one part of the layer, and for a Fourier decomposition in the second part of the layer (using periodic activation functions that were previously used for instance in the context of Fourier NNs~\cite{Silvescu1999FourierNN, sitzmann2020implicit}). After passing this `two-stream' layer, the two decomposition streams are algebraically combined to produce the DNN output.

We test \textsf{dNNsolve} on a broad range of ODEs and PDEs in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions. The main improvements on the one-stream PINNs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use the \textit{same} hyperparameters (such as learning rate, network size and number of points in the domain) for each $d$-dimensional PDE and achieve good accuracies for all of them.
\item A small NN architecture with $d\times \mathcal{O}(100-200)$ trainable parameters is effective for the problems at hand, while keeping the number of sampled points at $\mathcal{O}(1000)$. On the other hand, in e.g.~\cite{lu2020deepxde} PINNs with $ \mathcal{O}(1000-8000)$ parameters were employed for 1- and 2-dimensional examples.
\item We use only $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ epochs of ADAM (or $\mathcal{O}(100)$ with mini-batches) followed by a variable number of iterations of BFGS until convergence. This may be contrasted with the $15000-80000$ epochs of ADAM used in~\cite{lu2020deepxde}.
\end{itemize}

The plan of this note is as follows. In section~\ref{sec:Architecture} we will proceed to describe the setup of the two-stream PINN, and discuss its loss function as well its weight initialization and hyperparameter choices.
In section~\ref{sec:Results}, we present its application to significant number of ODEs and PDEs and (0+1), (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions. To gauge the accuracy of the solutions learned, we compare an accuracy estimate based on the root mean squared (RMS) error provided by the PINN loss function as well as the RMS error between the PINN solution and the known analytical solution for each example. A lot of the technical details are relegated to several appendices~\ref{sec:AppendixA}, \ref{app:1D}, \ref{app:2D}, \ref{app:3D}.




\section{Dual base network}
\label{sec:Architecture}

The aim of our work is to find an improved PINN architecture that is able to solve a general differential equation~\cite{Lagaris:1997ap}
\begin{equation}
G(\vec{x},u^{l}(\vec{x}),\nabla u^{l}(\vec{x}), u^{l}(\vec{x}),\nabla^2 u^{l}(\vec{x}), u^{l}(\vec{x}),\dots)=0\;,\qquad \vec{x}\in \mathcal{D} \subset \Bbb R^{D}\;, \qquad  \vec{u}(\vec{x})\in \Bbb R^{n_{\rm o}} \,,
\label{eq:PDE}
\end{equation}
subject to certain boundary and initial conditions, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the domain, $D$ is the number of spacetime dimensions and $n_{\rm o}$ is the number of components of $\vec{u}$. Therefore we look for a scalable architecture that can be easily adapted to problems having different input and output domain dimensions. In order to do this, we take direct inspiration from series expansion. The universal approximation theorem in its ‘arbitrary width’ formulation~\cite{cybenko1989approximation, HORNIK1991251, pinkus_1999} states that a feed forward NN with a single hidden layer and arbitrary continuous activation functions can approximate every continuous functions with arbitrary precision. On the other hand, carefully choosing the architecture and activation functions may be useful for computational purposes, reducing the amount of neurons needed to get the solution in a finite amount of time and with finite computational power.

One of the best-known tools to perform function decomposition is given by the Fourier series that allows one to decompose each piece-wise continuous function on some given interval. Nevertheless, also in this case, an exact function decomposition may be given by an infinite sum of  harmonic terms (a simple example is given by the infinite series representing a straight line). Trying to reduce the number of nodes required to obtain a satisfactory approximation of our PDE solution, given that we can not know a priori its behaviour, we decide to use two kinds of activation functions, i.e. sine and sigmoid functions. The latter can be used to reduce the number of neurons used in capturing the secular variations of the solution, while the sine performs a Fourier-like decomposition. We combine the two types of activation functions both linearly and non-linearly, trying to improve the robustness and flexibility of our network.
Our network architecture, dubbed \textsf{dNNsolve} is given by a feed forward NN with multiple inputs and outputs, five hidden layers (of which only two layers contain trainable parameters) and two branches representing the periodic and non-periodic expansion of the solution. In the first layer each input variable is processed independently by two dense layers having the same number of neurons $N$ with sigmoidal and sinusoidal activation function, respectively:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.5cm,
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=6cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm}]
  \node {$x^i$}
    child {node {$  \sin(\omega_k^{(i)} x^i  + \phi_k)\equiv f_k^{(i)}$}}
    child {node {$  \sigma(w_k^{(i)} x^i  + b_k)\equiv s_k^{(i)}$}}
    ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where $k=1, \dots, N$ and $i = 1, \dots, D$, where $D$ is the number of input variables, i.e. the number of spacetime dimensions of the problem.
Afterwards, the periodic and non-periodic outputs are merged together using three multiplication layers, see Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. These perform the element-wise multiplication of the neurons belonging to different input variables. This operation is performed for the two branches separately and for their product to take into account some non-linear interplay between the periodic and non-periodic decomposition of the solution.
The output of the multiplication layers, identified by ${F}$, ${S}$ and ${FS}$, can be summarized as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HiddenLayers}
{F}=\{F_k\}=\bigg\{\prod_{j=1}^{D}f_k^{(j)} \bigg\}\;, \qquad {S}=\{S_k\}=\bigg\{\prod_{j=1}^{D}s_k^{(j)} \bigg\}\;, \qquad {FS}=\{F_k S_k\} \,,
\end{equation}
where $k=1,\dots, N$.
These results are then joined together using a concatenation layer that is taken as input by a dense layer, ${D}$, with no activation function having $n_{\rm o}$ neurons, where $n_{\rm o}$ is the number of unknown functions we need to compute as output of our network (this depends on the problem at hand): ${D}_l(y)=d_{il} y^i + a_{l}$,  $l=1, \dots, n_{\rm o}$.
In the case of a single ODE with scalar input $x$, the output of our network is a single function $\hat{u}$. In this case, $D = 1$ and $n_{\rm o} =1$, and the output can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ExplicitODE}
\hat{u}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{N} d_k \sin(\omega_k x  + \phi_k) +  d_{N+k}\sigma(w_k x + b_k) + d_{2N+k}\sin(\omega_k x  + \phi_k)\sigma(w_k x + b_k) + a\,,
\end{equation}
where we have denoted $d_{k1} \equiv d_k$ and $a_1 \equiv a$.
A pictorial representation of our architecture for multiple inputs can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{\textsf{dNNsolve} network architecture for the case $D = 3$: multiple input variables are processed independently using Dense layers with sine and sigmoid activation functions. The results are then processed by three multiplication layers and finally merged together using a concatenation layer. The final output (scalar in this picture) is then computed using a simple dense layer with no activation function.}
  \label{fig:architecture}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Let us also mention that we tried several alternatives to the sine and sigmoid activation functions. In the secular branch of the network we also tried for instance with several possible activation functions: tanh, Gaussian, Hermite polynomials, $\tanh(x^p)$. In the Fourier part of the network we made a few experiments with wavelet layers~\cite{zhang1995wavelet}. Overall, we observed that the combination of sinusoidal activation functions with sigmoids is the best choice both in terms of accuracy and in terms ot training efficiency.

\paragraph{Weight initialization}
The number of network parameters is given by $4ND + n_{\rm o} (3N + 1)$, it scales linearly both in the number of input variables $d$ and in the number of neurons per branch $N$. After trying different possibilities, we choose the following weight initialization procedure: $d_k=10^{-4}$, $w_k^{(i)}\sim {U}(0,10^{-3})$, $\omega_k^{(i)}\sim {U}(\pi/(x_i^{\rm max}-x_i^{\rm min}),N\pi/(x_i^{\rm max}-x_i^{\rm min}))$ where $N$ is the number of neurons per branch. Biases, $a_l$, $\phi_k$, $b_k$, are always initialized to zero. The choice of the initialization for the frequency of the sine activation functions reflects some prior knowledge about the physical scales that characterize the system: for instance in the one-dimensional case, we do not expect hundreds of oscillations in the domain of definition of the ODE. The lowest frequency is chosen to be first harmonic since we want the sine activation functions to capture only the oscillating part of the solution as lower frequencies can be easily captured by sigmoid neurons. Regarding the amplitude parameters $d_i$, we choose to initialize them to tiny values, i.e. we start from nearly vanishing solution. This decision is related to the behaviour of the bulk contribution to the loss function. In case the ODE/PDE is homogeneous and admits a zero solution, in the first steps of training the algorithm tends to drive $d_i$ to zero before it starts learning the real solution. This happens because $\hat{u}=0$ appears to be a local minimum of the loss function. The amplitude initialization we choose is then able to shorten training under certain conditions that we describe in the next section.
Our choice of processing input variables independently, instead of using them as a single input for a dense layer, is motivated by empirical observation. Dense layers with sinusoidal activation function over linear combinations of inputs seemed to be less flexible during training, i.e. the system got systematically stuck in local minima. In order to overcome this problem, fine-tuned frequency weights initialization was required, leading to a poor level of generalization of the network. As opposed to sigmoid activation functions, sinusoidal functions in 2/3D are non localised in space and do not adapt well: a small change in one parameter implies changing the function in the whole area/volume. This makes their training very hard since the loss function turns out to be fulfilled with local minima~\cite{819741, Parascandolo2016}. We empirically found that this behaviour can be mitigated by processing input variables independently. This may be due to the presence of extra phase parameters ($\phi_k$) or because we reduce the effects of changing weights to a single dimension. 
\paragraph{Loss function}
Following~\cite{Sirignano_2018} we use a piece-wise loss function, given by the sum of different contributions coming from bulk, boundary and initial conditions points. Let us write the domain of our problem splitting it into time and space components: $\mathcal{D}=[t_0,t_L]\times \Omega$ where $\Omega\subset \Bbb R^{D-1}$. Different PDEs, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:PDE}, having different degrees in time and space variables can be subject to different conditions. In the examples showed in this work we mainly considered

\begin{itemize}
\item Initial conditions:
\begin{equation}
u^l(t_0,\vec{x})=u_0^l(\vec{x}) \,, \qquad [\partial_t u^l](t_0,\vec{x})=v_0^l(\vec{x})
\end{equation}
\item Boundary conditions:
\begin{eqnarray}
&& u^l(t,\vec{x})|_{\partial\Omega}=f^l(\vec{x}) \qquad \quad  \text{(Dirichlet)} \,, \\
&& \left[\partial_{\vec{n}} u^l (t,\vec{x})\right]|_{\partial\Omega}=g^l(\vec{x}) \quad \text{(Neumann)} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{n}$ is the normal to the boundary unit vector.
\end{itemize}

Collectively denoting by $\theta=\{w,\omega,\phi,b,d,a\}$ the set of NN parameters and $\hat{u}^l(\vec{x},t,\theta)$ the output of the NN, the general shape of the loss function is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Loss}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}(t,\vec{x},\theta,\alpha) &\equiv \mathcal{L}_{\Omega} + \mathcal{L}_{0} + \mathcal{L}_{\partial\Omega} = \\
&\displaystyle =
\sqrt{
\frac{1}{n_\Omega}\sum_i \left[
G(t_i,\vec{x}_i,\hat{u}^{l}(t_i,\vec{x_i},\theta),\nabla \hat{u}^{l}(t_i,\vec{x_i},\theta),\dots)\right]^2} \,+ \\
&\displaystyle + \, \alpha_0 \sqrt{
\frac{1}{2 n_0}\sum_j \left(\left[\hat{u}^l(t_0,\vec{x}_j,\theta)-u_0^l(\vec{x}_j)\right]^2+ \left[[\partial_t \hat{u}^l](t_0,\vec{x}_j,\theta)-v_0^l(\vec{x}_j)\right]^2\right)} \, +\\
&\displaystyle + \, \alpha_{\partial\Omega} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\partial\Omega}} \sum_k \left[u^l(t_k,\vec{x}_k,\theta)|_{\partial\Omega}-f^l(t_k,\vec{x}_k) \right]^2} \,,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where we considered Dirichlet boundary conditions and second order PDEs in time. We take the sum of square roots instead of the sum of squares, because empirically we observe 
that this typically converges faster and is more accurate.
If the boundary condition is not Dirichlet, the last term of the loss should be modified accordingly. Also, if the PDE is first order in time, the second term in the root of the second line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Loss} disappears. The loss function is computed over a batch of size $n_s=n_\Omega+n_{\partial\Omega}+n_0$ where $n_\Omega$, $n_{\partial\Omega}$ and $n_0$ are the number of points belonging to the bulk, the boundary and the initial condition respectively. Our loss function depends on two parameters, $\alpha_0 $ and $\alpha_{\partial\Omega}$ that can be considered as additional hyperparameters of the neural network. This kind of approach was also used in other works as~\cite{lu2020deepxde, Shin_2020}. These parameters are needed to let the NN be able to get out of local minima. For example, consider the case where an homogeneous PDE contains an identically zero solution and boundary conditions set the function to be vanishing on $\partial \Omega$. If we consider $\alpha_0=\alpha_{\partial\Omega}=1$ we have that 2/3 of the loss function drive the solution toward the local minimum $u\equiv 0$. From empirical observations we saw that the extent of this problem increases with the number of input dimensions $d$. On the other hand, taking $\alpha_0\gg 1\,,\,\alpha_{\partial\Omega}$ will introduce a hierarchy in ${L}$, pushing the solution away from zero (see~\cite{vandermeer2020optimally} for a work in an analogous direction). These weights can in principle also be used to put some priority in the piece-wise loss function: if all weights are equal and different parts of the loss function do not share local minima or saddle points, the convergence rate is slowed down. Some intuitions about the relation between different pieces of the loss function and the role played by $\alpha$ hyperparameters can be found in App.~\ref{sec:AppendixA}.
\paragraph{Optimizer and training}
Loss functions often exhibit pathological curvature, saddle points and local minima. Some of these problems can be addressed using adaptive SGD algorithms, as ADAM.  The use of mini-batches represents a source of stochasticity that helps in getting out of local minima, while momentum is able to get away from saddle points and proceed in pathological curvature regions accumulating the gradient over the past steps to determine the direction to go. Moreover, momentum gives a one-shot chance of getting out of local minima. As explained in the previous paragraph, the problem we aim to solve may suffer from the presence of local minima. Some of these can be due to discretization, others derive from the definition of the loss function, see App.~\ref{sec:AppendixA}. For this reason we decide to perform a two-step training using different optimizers.
In the first step we use the ADAM~\cite{kingma2014adam} optimizer for a fixed amount of epochs using mini-batches of 256 data. We start from a huge learning rate $\lambda=0.1$ and use the standard Tensorflow learning rate decay callback with parameter choices which reduce $\lambda$ by a factor $\delta=0.5$ when the loss does not decrease by an amount of $10^{-4}$ in $30$ iterations. ADAM training should end in a neighborhood of the global minimum. In the second step, we use BFGS algorithm~\cite{Dennis:1974:CSC,GoodBengCour16}, a second order quasi-Newton method that estimates the curvature of the parameter space via an approximation of the Hessian. This is able to speed up the convergence rate, reaching the minimum in a small number of iterations. We use BFGS without using mini-batches so as to have the best approximation of the loss volume. Training ends when the supremum norm of the gradient vector is below $10^{-8}$.

\paragraph{Validation of the results} In order to be able to check the accuracy of the results, we mainly considered PDEs with analytic solutions, with a few notable exceptions that will be discussed in due course. The accuracy of the solution will be expressed in terms of the root mean squared error $r$, that in the case of an initial/boundary value problem is defined as
\begin{equation}
r = \displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{\rm tot}} \sum_{i} \left|\hat{u}(t_i, \vec{x}_i, \tilde\theta) - \tilde{u}(t_i, \vec{x}_i)\right|^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{u}(t, \vec{x}, \tilde{\theta})$ is the NN output evaluated using the trained weights $\tilde\theta$, while $\tilde{u}(t, \vec{x})$ is the analytic solution evaluated at the point $(t, \vec{x})$. The $n_{\rm tot}$ collocation points $(t_i, \vec{x}_i)$ are taken on a regular grid with $\{200, 50, 30\}$ points per spacetime dimension in 1D, 2D and 3D respectively. Note that, even for a second order PDE in time, we do not have a separate initial condition and boundary piece, as with $r$ we only want to measure the average distance from the true solution. In the subsequent sections, we will report the loss values (both the total loss as well as the various components of the loss in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Loss}), to illustrate how the training proceeds, and the root mean squared error $r$, to evaluate the accuracy of the solutions otained using \textsf{dNNsolve}.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}
We study the performance and the robustness of our architecture in solving 1D ODEs and 2D/3D PDEs. In order to do so, we use the same weight initialization in all examples. Moreover, we consider the same number of points and architecture in all equations having same dimensionality, i.e. $D$ and $n_{\rm o}$. The same criterion is applied to hyper-parameters: we try to keep them fixed within each group of ODEs/PDEs. Numerical results show that this was possible for 1D/2D problems, while 3D problems required to slightly adjust the $\alpha$ parameters for the reasons described in the previous paragraph.

Please, note that the results that we are listing in this section do not correspond to our best results, as they are obtained using a random set of initialized weights as opposed to the best solution selected out of multiple runs~\cite{lu2020deepxde}.

All the computations were performed with a laptop whose specifics are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Machine: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015),
\item Processor: 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 (quad-core, 64bit, hyperthreading = 8 logical cores),
\item Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3,
\item OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.6.
\end{itemize}

We used \textsf{Tensorflow 2.4}~\cite{abadi2016tensorflow, dillon2017tensorflow}. All the computations were automatically parallelized via hyperthreading over 8 CPU cores. The RAM usage was always less than 500 MB for all the equations in any number of spacetime dimensions.


\subsection{1D ODEs}
\label{sec:1DODEs}

In 1D, we considered several initial value problems on the domain $t \in [0, 20]$ of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
G(t, u(t), u'(t)) = 0 \,, \qquad u(t_0) = u_0 \,, \qquad u'(t_0) = v_0 \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where the constraint on initial first derivative appears only in second order problems. In addition we solve a representative example of boundary value problem of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
G(t, u(t), u'(t)) = 0 \,, \qquad u(t_0) = u_0 \,, \qquad u(t_L) = u_L \,.
\end{eqnarray}
as well as a first order delay equation of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
G(t,t', u(t),u(t'), u'(t)) = 0 \,, \qquad u(t|t<t_0) = f(t) \,.
\end{eqnarray}
The explicit ODEs under study are listed in App.~\ref{app:1D}.
In all the examples we used $\{ n_{\Omega},n_{0}\}=\{ 2000,1\}$ collocation points and $n = 35$ neurons per branch. The oscillon profile equation, Eq.~\ref{eq:Oscillon} is a particular case: it is a boundary value problem in 1D and it is typically solved using the \textit{shooting method}. As it is particularly sensitive to the noise of unused neurons, we use only $n = 10$ neurons per branch in that particular example. It was possible to successfully solve all the equations reported in App.~\ref{app:1D} by fixing $\alpha_0=1$. The number of epochs using ADAM optimizer is $150$, while the total number of epochs, including the ones that use BFGS is reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:1D}.\\

From our results we can see that the \textsf{dNNsolve} is able to learn different kinds of solutions without changing the setting of weight initialization and hyperparameters. The network is able to learn which function basis can better approximate the solution and reduce the contributions coming from the other branches. On the other hand, the capability of really switching off redundant degrees of freedom still needs to be optimized. Six examples showing the interplay between different branches can be found in Figure \ref{fig:branches}. We see that, despite the network is able to focus on the right basis, it happens that spurious contributions may appear from the other branches as in the ‘two frequencies equation’, Eq.~ \ref{eq:DoubleFreq}. This problem becomes more apparent when the number of neurons per branch increases.

  \caption{Contributions coming from sine, sigmoid and non-linear branches to the solution of six of the 1D equations considered. As expected, the harmonic oscillator and its damped version are completely solved by the sinusoidal and non-linear branches respectively. In the two frequency example the sinusoidal branch is mainly used, but as it is clear from the solution at $t > 10$, noisy contributions from unuseful neurons are not completely switched off, which calls for a better optimisation. For the Delay Equation the sinusoidal branch captures the oscillatory part of the solution, while the other branches take care of the linear part. For the Gaussian and Oscillon profile equations, the non-linear and secular branches contribute to the final solution, while the sinusoidal is switched off.}
  \label{fig:branches}

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:colorplot} we illustrate the evolution of the neural network solutions of the Mathieu equation, see Eq.~\ref{eq:Mathieu}, and the double frequency equation, see Eq.~\ref{eq:DoubleFreq}, as function of number of epoch. In case of the double frequency equation we note that the neural network learns the low base frequency and the high frequency modulations simultaneously. This has to be contrasted with the expected behaviour of neural network interpolation, which typically learns from low to high frequencies~\cite{xu2019training}. However, since the loss function of \textsf{dNNsolve} is sensitive to the derivatives of the learned function as well, which are more enhanced around the high frequency modulations, the observed behaviour makes sense. The same observation was made in~\cite{lu2020deepxde}, although in their example the corresponding differential equation contained the range of frequencies explicitly as a force term. In case of the Mathieu equation we see that the learned solution remains close to a cosine for quite some training iterations until the BFGS optimizer manages to perturb it enough to quickly converge to a better approximation.

\subsection{2D PDE}
\label{sec:2DPDEs}

In 2D, we considered several boundary value problems on the domain $(x,y) \in [0,1]^2$ with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, as well as initial/boundary value problems on the domain $(t, x) \in [0, 1]^2$. We refer to App.~\ref{app:2D} for the explicit equations under study. In the 2D case we used $\{ n_{\Omega}, n_{\partial\Omega}, n_{0}\}=\{1000, 200, 200\}$ collocation points and $n = 10$ neurons per branch. Furthermore, it was possible to successfully solve all the equations reported in App.~\ref{app:2D} by fixing the loss weights to $\{\alpha_0,\alpha_{\partial \Omega}\}=\{10,1\}$. The number of epochs using ADAM optimizer is $210$, while the total number of epochs, including the ones that use BFGS is reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:2D}.

\subsection{3D PDE}
\label{sec:3DPDEs}

In the 3D case we considered several boundary value problems in the domain $(x, y, z) \in [0,1]^3$, as well as initial/boundary value problems in the domain $(t,x,y) \in [0,1]^3$. However, we need to distinguish the specifics of the solution case by case. For all the 3D PDEs listed in App.~\ref{app:3D} we used $\{ n_{\Omega},n_{\partial\Omega},n_{0}\}=\{ 1000,1200,500\}$ collocation points and we considered $210$ ADAM epochs. 
For the vorticity equation and the Lamb-Oseen vortex we used $n = 20$ neurons per branch, in all other cases $n = 10$ .
The total number of epochs, including the ones that use BFGS is reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:3D}. Moreover, the loss weights needed to be adjusted as described in Tab.~\ref{tab:3D} in order to obtain satisfactory accuracies. \\

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this paper, we presented a new implementation of the PINN concept to solve ODEs/PDEs using NNs - named \textsf{dNNsolve}. The main novelties of our implementation reside in two points: \textit{i)} the usage of two types of activation functions - sines and sigmoids - as a more efficient basis to expand the solution and \textit{ii)} the use of a new architecture, tailored in a way to provide the desired expansion in terms of this enlarged basis.

It is well known that a Fourier series can be used to expand any continuous function defined on a compact support, which is the case of the ODEs and PDEs considered in this paper. However, as a generic solution will not be just a periodic function, we expect that a more efficient representation than a bare Fourier expansion can be found by including sigmoid activation functions in the expansion basis. We naively expect that the sigmoids might help the network to capture any secular behaviour featured by the solution, while the sines would take care of any periodic behaviour. We also took into account the possible non-linear interplay between a periodic and a non-periodic expansion of the solution using element-wise multiplication of the sine and sigmoid branch. In order to achieve the expansion in this enlarged basis, we introduced a specific architecture, which is pictorially shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. We call this new implementation \textsf{dNNsolve}: \emph{d}ual \emph{N}eural \emph{N}etwork solve(r) of ODEs and PDEs.

We empirically show that the our expectation is met and the network is able to learn an efficient representation of the solution that most of the times makes use of both the sigmoids and the sines. We also show that in those cases that obviously require only one kind of basis functions (i.e. only sines, sigmoids or multiplication of them), the network is able to adjust the weights accordingly, basically cutting out the redundant branches. On the other hand, given that unused neurons are never exactly set to zero activation, these can bring noise to the solution, compromising the final accuracy. We saw this happening in the oscillon ODE where we had to reduce the number of neurons per branch. This remains an open problem of our architecture, the solution of which we leave for future works.

\textsf{dNNsolve} is able to solve a broad range of ODEs in 1D, see App.~\ref{app:1D}, including both first and second order initial value problems. In particular, it successfully solves the damped harmonic oscillator, whose solution rapidly goes to vanishing amplitude, as well as stiff and delayed equations. The accuracies of these solutions, listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:1D} were computed by comparing with the analytical solutions -- where these are available -- or with the solutions obtained through a standard solver such as the \textsf{odeint} and \textsf{ddeint} packages in Python, or \textsf{NDSolve} in \textsf{Mathematica}. All the root mean squared accuracies are below $10^{-3}$, reaching in 1D values $< 10^{-5}$ for the harmonic oscillator, its damped version and the oscillon profile equation. Interestingly, we were able to solve the oscillon profile equation, see Eq.~\ref{eq:Oscillon}, that is a boundary value problem in 1D, typically solved using the shooting method. We note that tunnelling profiles in phase transitions have been solved with a simple one layer PINN before in~\cite{Piscopo:2019txs}. Even though bubble profiles are expected to be particularly well expanded in a sigmoid base, we find that our NN oscillon solution makes use of the Fourier basis, and becomes much more accurate than the typical root mean squared accuracies $\sim 10^{-3}$ reported in~\cite{Piscopo:2019txs}. We plan to expand our study of these kinds of problems in a separate publication.

In 2D, \textsf{dNNsolve} was used to solve a variety of PDEs, see App.~\ref{app:2D}, including parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic types on a rectangular domain $[0,1]^2$. All the accuracies are below $10^{-4}$ (except for the heat equation, Eq.~\ref{eq:Heat2D2}), reaching values as small as $10^{-6}$, see Tab.~\ref{tab:2D}. Similar results are obtained in the 3D case, see Tab.~\ref{tab:3D}, in which case all the equations are solved on a cube of the form $[0,1]^3$.

As shown in App.~\ref{sec:AppendixA}, the use of sine activation functions may introduce local minima in the loss function, making it hard for the NN to converge to the true solution of the ODE/PDE. We addressed this problem by introducing two additional hyperparameters $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_{\partial\Omega}$ that assign different weights to the various parts of the loss function (for initial/boundary value problems), see Eq.~\eqref{eq:Loss}, in the 2D and 3D cases. In particular, in the 2D case we had to weigh the initial conditions part of the loss, $\mathcal{L}_0$, more than the other two pieces in order for \textsf{dNNsolve} to converge to the true solution for all the PDEs considered. In the 3D case it was not possible to find a common choice of the hyperparameters $\alpha$, hence the optimal values are reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:3D}. Overall, we did not fine-tune the hyperparameters $\alpha$ in any of the examples presented: even in the 3D case we just picked one combination of $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_{\partial_\Omega}$ (choosing their value to be either $1$ or $10$) that led to an acceptable accuracy. We consider this to be one of the main achievements of our work: \textsf{dNNsolve} is able to solve a broad class of differential equations without the need to tune (or with a mild tuning in the 3D case) any hyperparameter. We leave to future work the implementation of an automatic procedure for the optimal choice of the hyperparameters $\alpha$. Also, note that the results we have reported are not the best results achievable with \textsf{dNNsolve}, as they are obtained using a random set of initialized weights as opposed to the best solution selected out of multiple runs~\cite{lu2020deepxde}.

Finally, one interesting question to ask from the physicist's point of view is whether these kinds of solvers might be able to replace standard lattice codes for instance to perform cosmological simulations. It has already been shown~\cite{avrutskiy2020neural} that NN solvers are able to catch up with finite difference methods both in terms of memory complexity (in 3D) and in terms of time complexity (in 5D). Our method is a further step in the direction of making NN-based PDE solvers competitive with standard methods, since it improves the efficiency of the representation of the PDE solution. In order to become fully competitive though, further improvements need to be implemented, among which: \textit{i)} we need to find a way to reduce the noise coming from superfluous neurons, see discussion above; \textit{ii)} we need a better way for the network to avoid local minima, for instance implementing an automatic tuning of the hyperparameters $\alpha$; \textit{iii)} we need an efficient way to parallelize the computation over multiple CPUs and/or GPUs. We plan to come back to these points in future works.

\section{Comments on $\alpha$ hyperparameters}
\label{sec:AppendixA}
In this section we provide some empirical evidence about the advantages of using $\alpha$ hyperparameters to give different weights to the various loss function contributions. To do this, we discuss a couple of examples, focusing on the periodic branch of our architecture. We will consider the simplest Fourier NN with 1 hidden layer and 1 neuron per input variable. 
\paragraph{1D harmonic oscillator}
We want to get some intuition about the loss space when using a sine activation function. In order to do that, we consider a NN having a single sine neuron with a 1D input:
\begin{equation}
\hat{u}=d\sin(\omega t +\phi)
\end{equation}
We try to understand what is the shape of the loss function if we look for solutions of the following harmonic oscillator ODE:
\[\left\{ \begin{array}{llllllll}
 u''+ (5\pi)^2 u=0\\
u(0)=0\\
u'(0)=10\pi\\ 
\end{array}
\right. \qquad t\in[0,1] \] \,.
According to our prescriptions, the loss function in the bulk is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}_{\Omega}^2&=\frac{1}{n_\Omega}\sum_i \left[ \hat{u}''+ (5\pi)^2 \hat{u}\right]^2 \\[10pt]
&\sim \displaystyle \frac{d^2}{(\Delta x)} \left[(5\pi)^2-\omega^2\right]^2 \int dt \sin^2(\omega t +\phi)\\[10pt]
&= \displaystyle \frac{d^2}{(\Delta x)} \left[(5\pi)^2-\omega^2\right]^2 \left(\frac{2 \omega + \sin(2\phi)-\sin[2(\omega+\phi)]}{4 \omega} \right) \,,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
while the loss for the initial condition is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}_{0}^2&=\frac{1}{2 n_0}\sum_j \left(\left[\hat{u}(0)\right]^2+ \left[\hat{u}'(0))-5\pi\right]^2\right)\\[10pt]
&=\frac{1}{2} \left(d^2\sin^2(\phi)+ \left[d\,\omega \cos(\phi)-10\pi\right]^2\right)\,.\\[10pt]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The total loss is given by the weighted sum:
\begin{equation}
{L}= {L}_{\Omega} + \alpha_0 {L}_{0}\,.
\end{equation}
In order to see the relation between the different pieces of the loss function and understand the effects of discretization, we provide some plots of $ {L}$ related to this simple example.
Let us first fix the amplitude parameter to its minimum $d=2$  and plot the 2D loss surface in Figure \ref{fig:sineloss}. These plots are obtained using the discrete definition of the loss, for different values of $ \alpha_0=1,10$ and different numbers of bulk points. Without loss of generality,  we sample the bulk points on an equally spaced grid. We can clearly see the presence of local minima near $\omega=0$ coming from the bulk part of the loss. From the central plot we can infer that setting $\alpha_0\gg 1$ sharpens the location of the global minima located in $\omega=5\pi$, $\phi=0+2\pi k$, $k\in\Bbb Z$. Moreover, comparing the results obtained using $\Delta t=0.05$ and $\Delta t=0.1$, we see that choosing a too wide gridstep may lead to the formation of spurious local minima. 
Despite its simplicity, this example is able to highlight the problems related to NNs with periodic activation functions. On top of local minima coming from the discretization procedure, the loss is intrinsically fulfilled with functions having a huge number of local minima, e.g. cardinal sine.
\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{center}

  \caption{2D loss function ${L}(\omega,\phi)$ obtained from sampling bulk points on a grid of step $\Delta t=0.05$ (left, center) and $\Delta t=0.1$ (right). Left and central plots show the shape of the loss surface when $\alpha_0=1$ and $\alpha_0=10$ respectively. These plots do not reveal any appreciable difference with the analytic result coming from the continuous limit. The right plot shows how artificial local minima can arise from poor sampling.}
  \label{fig:sineloss}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Let us now also investigate the r\^ole of the amplitude parameter $d$. The top panels of Figure \ref{fig:sine_amplitude_loss} show the bulk and IC part of the loss function while the total losses, considering $\alpha_0=1,10$, are shown in the bottom panels. As before, these plots are obtained using a grid with $\Delta t=0.1$. From the top plots we can see that IC and bulk loss do not share their local minima. Compared to the previous analysis, the bulk loss exhibits a new local minimum at $d=0$. This comes from the fact that the wave equation is homogeneous and allows for vanishing solutions. Given that ${L}_{\Omega}$ linearly depends on $d$, it is very easy for the network to minimize the $d$ direction. This, coupled to the fact that on average ${L}_{\Omega}>{L}_{0}$, implies that in the early stages of training the network parameters will rapidly reach the $d=0$ surface. If we do not introduce $\alpha$ hyperparameters, this behaviour becomes a serious problem of the training process. Indeed, the bottom-left plot of Figure \ref{fig:sine_amplitude_loss} shows that, choosing $\alpha_0=1$, $d=0$ is a flat local minimum of the loss function, i.e. $\nabla_{\omega,\phi}{L}|_{d=0}=(0,0)$.
On the other hand, according to what we have seen before, setting $\alpha_0\gg 1$ sharpens the location of the global minima (bottom-right plot). This result should not be surprising at all: an ODE defined on a certain domain admits infinite solutions and the result of an ODE problem becomes unique if and only if we provide the initial conditions. Therefore, we must set $\alpha_0\gg 1$ to counteract the loss hierarchy ${L}_{\Omega}>{L}_{0}$.
Indeed, also from a theoretical point of view, the minimization of the bulk loss becomes really informative only if it takes place after or together with the minimization of ${L}_0$.

These plots do not reveal any appreciable difference with the analytic result coming from the continuous limit.}

\paragraph{2+1D wave equation}
We focus on a slightly more complex toy model given by solving the 2+1D wave equation (see Eq.~\ref{eq:Wave3D}) with three sine neurons. A simplified version of our sinusoidal branch would be given by:
\begin{equation}
\hat{u}=\sin(\omega_t t+\phi_t)\sin(\omega_x x+\phi_x)\sin(\omega_y y+\phi_y) \,.
\end{equation}
We use this network to solve the following PDE:
\[\left\{ \begin{array}{llllllll}
\partial_{tt}^2 u - (\partial_{xx}^2 u+ \partial_{yy}^2 u) = 0\\
u(0,x,y)=\sin(3 \pi x)\sin(4 \pi y)\\
\partial_t u(0,x,y)=0\\ 
u\left|_{\partial\Omega}\right.=0
\end{array}
\right.  \qquad \Omega=[0,1]^3 \,.\] 
According to the definition given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Loss}, the parts of the loss function associated to the bulk, the initial condition and the boundary are given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}_{\Omega}^2&=\displaystyle\frac{1}{n_\Omega}\sum_i \left[
\partial_{tt}^2 \hat{u} - (\partial_{xx}^2 \hat{u}+ \partial_{yy}^2 \hat{u})\right]^2 \\[10pt]
&\sim \displaystyle \frac{1}{V(\Omega)} \displaystyle \int_\Omega dx dy dt \left[
\partial_{tt}^2 \hat{u} - (\partial_{xx}^2 \hat{u}+ \partial_{yy}^2 \hat{u})\right]^2  \\[10pt]
&= \displaystyle\frac{(\omega_x^2+\omega_y^2-\omega_t^2)^2}{V(\Omega)} \displaystyle \int_\Omega dx dy dt \left[\sin(\omega_t t+\phi_t)\sin(\omega_x x+\phi_x)\sin(\omega_y y+\phi_y)\right]^2  \\[10pt]
&= \displaystyle\frac{(\omega_x^2+\omega_y^2-\omega_t^2)^2}{V(\Omega)} \displaystyle \prod_{i=t,x,y} \left(\frac{2 \omega_i + \sin(2\phi_i)-\sin[2(\omega_i+\phi_i)]}{4 \omega_i} \right) \,, \\ 
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}_{0}^2&=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2 n_0}\sum_j \left(\left[\hat{u}(t_0)-\sin(3 \pi x)\sin(4 \pi y)\right]^2+ \left[[\partial_t \hat{u}](t_0))\right]^2\right)\\[10pt]
&\displaystyle\sim\frac{1}{2A(\Omega_0)}\int_{\Omega_0}dx dy \left(\left[\hat{u}(t_0)-\sin(3 \pi x)\sin(4 \pi y)\right]^2+ \left[[\partial_t \hat{u}](t_0))\right]^2\right)\\[10pt]
&\displaystyle=\frac{1}{2A(\Omega_0)}\left[\displaystyle  \int_{\Omega_0}dx dy \left[\sin(\phi_t)\sin(\omega_x x+\phi_x)\sin(\omega_y y+\phi_y)-\sin(3 \pi x)\sin(4 \pi y)\right]^2+\right. \\[10pt]
&\displaystyle \qquad +\left. \int_{\Omega_0}dx dy \left[\omega_t \cos(\phi_t)\sin(\omega_x x+\phi_x)\sin(\omega_y y+\phi_y)\right]^2\right]\\[10pt]

&\qquad\left.\displaystyle + \left(\sin^2(\phi_t)+\omega_t^2\cos^2(\phi_t)\right)\prod_{i=x,y}\left(\frac{2 \omega_i + \sin(2\phi_i)-\sin[2(\omega_i+\phi_i)]}{4 \omega_i} \right)\right] \,,\\[10pt]
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
{L}_{\partial \Omega}^2&\displaystyle=\frac{1}{n_{\partial\Omega}} \sum_k \left[\hat{u}|_{\partial\Omega} \right]^2\\[10pt]

&\displaystyle= \frac{1}{4A(\partial\Omega)}\displaystyle \left( (\sin^2(\phi_x)+\sin^2(\omega_x +\phi_x)) \int dy dt (\sin^2(\omega_t t+\phi_t)\sin^2(\omega_y y+\phi_y)) \right.\\[10pt]
&\qquad \left.+ (\sin^2(\phi_y)+\sin^2(\omega_y +\phi_y)) \displaystyle \int dy dt (\sin^2(\omega_t t+\phi_t)\sin^2(\omega_x x+\phi_x)\right)\\[10pt]
&\displaystyle= \frac{1}{4A(\partial\Omega)}\displaystyle \left\{\left(\frac{2 \omega_t + \sin(2\phi_t)-\sin[2(\omega_t+\phi_t)]}{4 \omega_t} \right) \times\right.\\[10pt]
&\qquad  \displaystyle \left[ (\sin^2(\phi_x)+\sin^2(\omega_x +\phi_x)) \left(\frac{2 \omega_y + \sin(2\phi_y)-\sin[2(\omega_y+\phi_y)]}{4 \omega_y}\right) \right.\\[10pt]
&\qquad  \displaystyle \left.\left. (\sin^2(\phi_y)+\sin^2(\omega_y +\phi_y)) \left(\frac{2 \omega_x + \sin(2\phi_x)-\sin[2(\omega_x+\phi_x)]}{4 \omega_x}\right)   \right]\right\}\,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
We plot ${L}_{\Omega}$, ${L}_{0}$ and ${L}_{\partial\Omega}$  in Figure \ref{fig:lossparts}, fixing the phase parameters at their minima. These results show that there is a natural hierarchy, i.e.  ${L}_{\Omega}\gg{L}_{0},{L}_{\partial\Omega}$, that can be explained by the effect of derivation on Fourier NN: each derivative provides a $\omega$ power in the loss function. This results in a polynomial behaviour of ${L}_{\Omega}$ in the frequency space, while initial conditions and boundary conditions may be at most linear. Given that the initial conditions of the parameters are randomly chosen, this implies that, on average, ${L}_{\Omega}$ will be the major contribution to the loss function in the early stages of training.

\label{fig:lossparts}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Going back to our example, this means that training will lead the parameters toward the surface $(\omega_x^2+\omega_y^2-\omega_t^2)=0$ that is clearly visible in the left plot of Figure \ref{fig:architecture}. From then on, the trajectory in the parameter space will not be able to leave the surface and there is a high probability of getting stuck in one of the minima of ${L}_{\partial\Omega}$, see Figure \ref{fig:minima}. One way to overcome this problem is to impose some hierarchy among the different contributions to the loss function. This can be done by setting the pieces that carry more information about the solution to higher values. In the specific case analyzed in this section, this results in setting $\alpha_0\gg 1$.

While the contribution coming from IC (left) shows a single minimum, the boundary contribution is fulfilled with equally spaced minima (center).  The total residual loss (right) is then characterised by the presence of infinitely many local minima surrounding the true solution. This makes the NN training extremely hard and the system gets usually stuck in a local minimum.  }

\end{document}

In this appendix we present some details of the derivation of Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:gauge_sourced} and we also show some plots that ensure the validity of the approximations performed during this procedure. Let us start by expressing Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_fluctuations} as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\label{spectrum:perturbations_final}
	&-\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \frac{\delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}}}{K}  = \ddot{\delta\phi} + \left[ 3H + \dot{\phi}_0 \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}   - \frac{\pi}{ H K} \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle \right] \dot{\delta \phi} \, +  \\ 
	&\qquad \qquad + \left[ \frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left(\frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}\right) \dot{\phi}_0^{ 2}  + \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left( \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K}\right) - \left(\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda}\right) \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}   \frac{\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle}{K} - \frac{\vec{\nabla}^2}{a^2} \right] \delta \phi \  .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
By neglecting the $\ddot{\delta \phi}$ term and the $ \vec{\nabla}^2 \delta \phi /a^2$ (that clearly are higher order in terms of the slow-roll parameters) and, following the same procedure used in~\cite{Linde:2012bt} by approximating $\dot{\delta \phi}$ with $H \delta \phi$, Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_final} can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\label{spectrum:perturbations_approx}
	&-\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \frac{\delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}}}{K}  = \left[ 3H^2 + \dot{\phi}_0 H \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}   - \frac{\pi}{ K} \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle \right.  \, +  \\ 
	&\qquad \qquad + \left. \frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left(\frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}\right) \dot{\phi}_0^{ 2}  + \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d} \phi_0} \left( \frac{V_{E,\phi_0}}{K}\right) - \left(\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda}\right) \frac{\textrm{d} \ln K}{\textrm{d} \phi_0}   \frac{\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle}{K} \right] \delta \phi \  .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
At this point, we can proceed by neglecting all the other terms that are not relevant in order to study the evolution of the system in the gauge field dominated regime. In particular, it is possible to show that most of the terms appearing in Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} are not relevant for our purposes. In order to show this explicitly we have substituted the solution $\phi_0(N)$ for the background equations of motion (i.e.\ the system given by Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:background_scalar} and Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:background_friedmann_2}) into Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx}. The plots of the absolute values of the different terms appearing in Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:checks} for two of the models presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}. It should be clear from these plots that Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} can be approximated by only keeping the terms proportional to $3H^2$ and the $\frac{\pi}{ K} \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \langle \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} \rangle$. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.565\textwidth]{Check_nm=001_N=10}
\includegraphics[width=0.425\textwidth]{Check_nm=7_N=1}
\caption{Evolution of the terms in Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} for the case $h(\phi) = \phi$ with $\varsigma = 0.01$, $\mathcal{N}=10$ (left plot) and for the case $\varsigma = 7$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ (right plot) expressed in natural units. In particular the different colors correspond to the six terms on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} respectively.}
\label{fig:checks}
\end{figure}

Using this approximation (consistent with the discussion carried out in~\cite{Linde:2012bt}) Eq.~\eqref{spectrum:perturbations_approx} can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	-\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}} =  3H^2 K \left[ 1  - \pi \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \frac{\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle}{3 H^2 K}  \right] \delta \phi \ . 
	\label{eq:phiEB}
\end{equation}
At this point we can proceed by defining:
\begin{equation}
	b \equiv  1  -  \pi \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \frac{\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle}{3 H^2 K} \ ,
\end{equation}
so that in the case $K(\phi) = 1$ we recover the usual expression:
\begin{equation}
	b = 1  -  \pi \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2 \frac{\langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}\rangle}{3 H^2 } \ .
\end{equation}
In the approximation $\langle \zeta^2(x) \rangle \simeq \Delta^2_s (k)  $, the scalar power spectrum in the gauge field dominated regime can thus be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
 	\left.  \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{gauge} \simeq \left(\frac{H}{\dot{\phi}_0}\right)^2 \langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle \simeq \left(\frac{H}{\dot{\phi}_0}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{3 b H^2 K }\right)^2 \langle (\delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}})^2 \rangle \ ,
 \end{equation} 
 and finally, using $\langle (\delta_{\vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}})^2 \rangle \simeq \langle \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B} \rangle^2$, we get:
 \begin{equation}
 	\label{spectrum:gauge_sourced}
 	\left.  \Delta^2_s (k) \right|_\text{gauge} \simeq  \left(\frac{\alpha \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a  \rangle / \sqrt{\mathcal{N}} }{3 b \Lambda \dot{\phi}_0 H K }\right)^2  \ ,
 \end{equation}
  where we also have generalized the definition of $b$:
  \begin{equation}
	b \equiv  1  -  \pi \left( \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \frac{\langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a  \rangle }{3 H^2 K} \ ,
 \end{equation}
in order to extend our results to the case with $\mathcal{N}$ Abelian gauge fields.

\subsection{A quick review of PBH formation}

The models discussed in the previous sections generically lead to a strong enhancement of the scalar power spectrum at small scales. If the scalar fluctuations are sufficiently large, this leads to the formation of PBHs in the subsequent evolution of the universe. Here we briefly review the resulting PBH distribution following Ref.~\cite{Carr:2009jm}, collecting the relevant tools to apply this formalism to our discussion.

Primordial scalar fluctuations with a power spectrum $P(\zeta)$ form PBHs upon re-entry into the horizon if  $\zeta > \zeta_c$. The mass $M$ of the resulting black hole can be estimated to be determined by the mass $M_H$ contained in the horizon at the  time of horizon re-entry $t_N$,
\begin{equation}
M(N) = \gamma M_H
 \simeq  \gamma \, \frac{4 \pi \, m_p^2}{H_\text{inf}}\,  e^{j N} \simeq 55 \, g \, \gamma \, \left( \frac{10^{-6} \, m_p}{H_\text{inf}}\right) \, e^{j N} \,,
 \label{eq:MH}
\end{equation}
with $N$ counting the number of e-folds from the end of inflation when the fluctuations in question exited the horizon, $H_\text{inf}$ denoting the Hubble parameter at this time and $j$ parameterizing if the equation of state between the end of inflation and the re-entry of the fluctuation was mainly matter dominated ($j = 3$) or radiation dominated ($j = 2$). In the setup of Sec.~\ref{sec:review} we expect reheating to be efficient due to the inflaton gauge field coupling. In the following we will thus work with $j = 2$. Finally, $\gamma$ is a numerical factor depending on the details of the gravitational collapse. Following~\cite{Green:2004wb, Carr:2016drx} we will use $\gamma = 0.4$. 

The fraction of the energy density of the universe which collapses into PBHs at any given time $t_N$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\beta(N) = \int_{\zeta_c}^\infty  \frac{ M(N)}{M_H(N)} P_N(\zeta) \, \textrm{d}\zeta =  \int_{\zeta_c}^\infty  \gamma \, P_N(\zeta) \, \textrm{d}\zeta\,.
\label{eq:beta0}
\end{equation}
Here $P_N(\zeta)$ denotes the probability distribution of fluctuations sourced at $N$ e-folds before the end of inflation. In our case, the fluctuations are characterized by a strong equilateral non-Gaussianity~\cite{Anber:2012du}, and can in particular be expressed as $\zeta = g^2 - \langle g^2 \rangle$ with $g \propto (\vec E \cdot \vec B)^{1/2}$ following a Gaussian distribution (see Eq.~\ref{eq:phiEB})~\cite{Linde:2012bt}. For such a positive $\chi$-squared form of non-Gaussianities, the probability distribution is given by (see e.g.~\cite{0510052, 1201.4312, Byrnes:2012yx}):
\begin{equation}
P_N(\zeta) = \frac{\exp \left( - \frac{\zeta + \sigma_N^2}{2 \sigma_N^2}\right)}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_N^2 (\zeta + \sigma_N^2)}} \;,
\label{eq:Pnongauss}
\end{equation}
with $\sigma_N^2 = (\Delta_s^2(N))^{1/2}$ and $\int_{- \sigma_N^2}^\infty P_N(\zeta) \, \textrm{d}\zeta = 1$.  
Since Eq.~\eqref{eq:MH} provides a unique relation between the time of formation $t_N$ and the mass of the PBH $M$, we can equivalently express the fraction $\beta(N) \, \textrm{d}N$ of the universe collapsing in the time interval $[t_N, t_{N + dN}[$ as a function of the PBH mass $M$:
\begin{equation}
\beta(N) \, \textrm{d}N = \beta(M) \frac{dN}{dM}\, \textrm{d}M = \frac{\beta(M)}{2 \, M} \, \textrm{d}M \,.
\label{eq:betaM}
\end{equation}
We stress that $\beta$ denotes the fraction of the universe collapsing into PBHs at the respective time of formation. Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, we can translate this to the fraction of the energy density in the Universe at some later time. Ignoring the decay of PBHs for the moment (we will return to this point below) and assuming an adiabatically expanding universe, the ratio of the number density of PBHs $n_{\text{PBH}}(t)$ and the entropy $s(t)$ is constant. We can hence relate the function $\beta(M)$ to the number density of PBHs at any later time $t$ as~\cite{Carr:2009jm}:
\begin{equation}
\beta(M) = \frac{M n_\text{PBH}(t_N)}{\rho(t_N)} = \frac{4\,  M \, n_\text{PBH}(t)}{3 \, T(t_N) \, s(t)} \,,
\label{eq:nPBH}
\end{equation}
with $\rho(t_N) = 3/4 \, T(t_N) \, s(t_N)$ denoting the energy density of the Universe, assuming that the universe is dominated by radiation at $t_N$. The temperature $T(t_N)$ is related to $H(t_N) = H_\text{inf} \exp(- 2 N)$ through the Friedmann equation. Substituting $H_\text{inf} \exp(- 2 N)$ into Eq.~\eqref{eq:MH}, we find that the fraction of dark matter today formed by PBHs is
\begin{align}
f(M)  & = \frac{M n_\text{PBH}(t_0) }{\Omega_\text{CDM} \, \rho_c} \simeq \nonumber \\ 
& \simeq 4.1 \cdot 10^8 \, \gamma^{1/2} \left( \frac{g_{*}(t_N)}{106.75}\right)^{-1/4} \left( \frac{h}{0.68}\right)^{-2} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} \beta(M)\,,
\label{eq:f}
\end{align}
where we have inserted $\rho_c = 3 H_0^2 m_p^2$ with $H_0 = h \, 100 \,$~(km/s)/Mpc for the critical density and $\Omega_\text{CDM} \simeq 0.21$ for the dark matter fraction today. In the following, we will set $h = 0.68$ and $g_*(t_N) = 106.75$. PBHs with masses below $M_\text{PBH} < M_* \simeq 5 \cdot 10^{14}$~g have a life time shorter than the current age of the universe and would have evaporated through Hawking radiation by now.\footnote{The numerical value $M_*$ might be enhanced when taking into account accretion and merger processes in the matter dominated regime which stabilize light PBHs, see App.~\ref{app:PBH}.} The interpretation of $f(M)$ as the fraction of dark matter hence only applies for $M > M_*$, for smaller values of $M$ the ratio $f(M)$ may simply be seen as a convenient way of parameterizing the initial PBH abundance $\beta(M)$.

The production of PBHs is subject to various constraints, see Ref.~\cite{Carr:2009jm} for an overview and Ref.~\cite{Carr:2016drx} for updated bounds on the mass range $M > M_*$, which will be the range most relevant for us here. As pointed out in Ref.~\cite{Carr:2016drx}, applying these bounds to an extended mass function requires some care. Essentially, a flat constraint $f_\text{max}$ in a certain mass range implies that the total amount of PBHs in this mass range may not exceed the value $f_\text{max}$. A general constraint can then be treated as a sequence of approximately flat constraints. Here we follow the procedure suggested there, requiring
\begin{equation}
\int_{M_1}^{M_2} \frac{\textrm{d}M}{2 M} f(M) < f_\text{max}^{[M_1,M_2]} \,,
\label{eq:fbound}
\end{equation}
with the constraints $f_\text{max}$ taken from Tab.~1 of Ref.~\cite{Carr:2016drx} and $f_\text{max}^{[M_1,M_2]}$ denoting the weakest constraint in the mass range $[M_1,M_2]$. Here we vary the integration boundaries $M_{1,2}$ so that all relevant mass intervals are covered. We have used Eq.~\eqref{eq:betaM} to obtain a dimensionless integrand in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fbound}. 

We note that the PBH formation as sketched above is subject to theoretical uncertainties, in particular concerning the effects of critical collapse, non-spherical properties of the primordial fluctuations and late time accretion and mergers. We discuss these issues in more detail in App.~\ref{app:PBH}. The upshot is that these uncertainties are to large degree degenerate with our model parameters, and hence will not change the overall picture presented here.


\subsection{PBHs in models with non-minimal coupling to gravity}



In Fig.~\ref{fig:BH1} we depict two typical results for $f(M)$ for the first model discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}, characterized by a non-minimal coupling to gravity through $h(\phi) = \phi$. The parameters\footnote{Here $m^2 = 2 \lambda^4$ in Eq.~\eqref{attractors:model_def}.}  $\alpha/\Lambda$, $m$, $\varsigma$ and ${\cal N}$ are chosen to meet the following conditions: (i) the amplitude and spectral tilt of the scalar spectrum at the CMB scales match the observed values, (ii) the effect of the gauge field contribution is maximized while respecting the CMB non-Gaussianity bounds and (iii) the PBH abundance is maximized while respecting the depicted PBH bounds. Moreover, the orange curve corresponds to the situation which roughly maximizes the contribution to PBH dark matter in this setup. The parameter values for the depicted curves are $m = 7.6 \cdot 10^{-5}\, m_p$, $\alpha/\Lambda = 43.2$ for the $\varsigma = 5$ example and $m = 5.4 \cdot 10^{-5}\, m_p$, $\alpha/\Lambda = 37$ for the $\varsigma = 3$ example. The resulting mass functions increase towards low PBH masses at $M \ll M_*$, hence only the high-mass tails of these distributions can contribute to PBH dark matter today. The strongest constraints close to the dark matter threshold come from evaporating PBH around $M \sim M_*$, which leave traces in the anisotropies of the CMB~ and in the (extra-) galactic photon background (see \cite{Carr:2009jm} for details), which imply $\beta(M) \lesssim 10^{-28}$ in this mass range. For the depicted examples, we find for the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to scalar ratio $r$ and the fraction of PBH dark matter $f_\text{tot}$,
\begin{align}
\varsigma &= 5: \quad n_s = 0.98 \,, \quad r = 1 \cdot 10^{-3} \,, \quad f_\text{tot} \approx 0  \,,\\
\varsigma &= 3: \quad n_s = 0.97 \,, \quad r = 5 \cdot 10^{-3} \,, \quad f_\text{tot} = 3 \cdot 10^{-23} \,.
\end{align}

The parameters of these curves are chosen to maximize the PBH contribution while obeying the depicted PBH bounds as well as the CMB constraints. 
 Note that the quantity $f(M)$ corresponds to the fraction of dark matter today  only for $M > M_* \simeq 5 \cdot 10^{14}$~g.}

To obtain a mass distribution peaked at heavier PBHs, we need to modify the functional dependence of the non-minimal coupling, $h(\phi)$. In particular we require a scalar spectrum which rises at larger values of $N$, i.e.\ at an earlier stage during inflation. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}, this can be realized by considering for example $h(\phi) = 1 - 1/\phi$. In this case, for sufficiently large values of $\varsigma$ the scalar spectrum features a peak at large scales (see Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra}) that can suitably induce the generation of a distribution of PBHs. The exact position and the shape of the peak are controlled by the parameters $\alpha/\Lambda$ and $\varsigma$.
In particular, increasing the value of $\varsigma$ moves the peak towards larger values of $N$ (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra}) and suppresses the amplitude, whereas increasing the value of $\alpha/\Lambda$ enhances the spectrum while also shifting the peak towards larger values of $N$ (see e.g.\ \cite{Domcke:2016bkh}). 
Since both parameters also impact the CMB observables, the depicted curves roughly demonstrate the range of possibilities for this choice of $h(\phi)$.


 For the examples shown in the plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} we have: 
\begin{align}
\varsigma &= 45.7, \quad \alpha/\Lambda \simeq 63: \quad n_s = 0.963 \,, \quad r = 3.2 \cdot 10^{-4} \,,\\
\varsigma &= 55, \quad \ \ \alpha/\Lambda \simeq 71: \quad n_s = 0.957 \,, \quad r = 3.3 \cdot 10^{-4}  \,,
\\\varsigma &= 65.5, \quad \alpha/\Lambda \simeq 74: \quad n_s = 0.958 \,, \quad r = 7.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \,.
\end{align}
For reference, we also show the result for a negligible non-minimal coupling (purple curve). The bumps in the spectra for the three models shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} lead to the generation of PBH distributions peaked around $M \sim 10^{20}, \, 10^{25}$ and $10^{31}$~g, respectively, thus in all three cases the entire PBH population contributes to dark matter today. In all cases we restrict ourselves to a single gauge field, ${\cal N} = 1$. As in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH1}, the model parameters for these benchmark points have been chosen in order to maximize the PBH contribution while obeying all relevant bounds. The reduced amplitude for the $\varsigma = 65.5$ example is due CMB constraints which become more relevant as $\alpha/\Lambda$ is increased.

In this mass range, the strongest constraints come from neutron star capture~\cite{Capela:2013yf} as well as from micro lensing constraints from the Kepler, MACHO, EROS and OGLE experiments~\cite{Griest:2013aaa,Tisserand:2006zx,Novati:2013fxa}. 
In particular, the micro lensing constraints restrict the total amount of PBHs to be less than $4\%$ to $30\%$ in their respective mass ranges, whereas the neutron star capture constraint requires the total amount of PBHs to be less than $6\%$ for $10^{18}~\text{g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{24}$~g. 
This last constraint (shown as a dashed curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2}) has been disputed, as it relies on assumptions about the dark matter content in globular clusters~\cite{Carr:2016drx}. For the pink curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} we thus choose to omit this constraint, demonstrating that in this case PBHs can account for \textit{all} of dark matter.\footnote{Upon finalizing this paper, we became aware of the very recent microlensing constraint from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam~\cite{Niikura:2017zjd}, which sets strong constraints on most of this window, leaving only a narrow slice around $M \simeq 10^{20}$~g for a significant PBH contribution to dark matter in this mass range.} Of course, if new results confirm this bound, the fraction of PBH dark matter in this mass range must be less than the $6\%$ mentioned above. 



The total fraction of PBH dark matter today is given by
\begin{equation}
f_\text{tot} = \frac{\Omega_{\text{PBH}}}{\Omega_{\text{CDM}}} = \int_{M_*}^\infty \frac{\textrm{d} M}{2 M}  \, f(M) \,,
\end{equation}
where in practice we need to integrate only over the strongly enhanced part of the scalar spectrum, as it is well-known that the contribution from the spectrum at CMB scales (where the amplitude is fixed by CMB observations) is completely negligible.\footnote{Strictly speaking, our analysis here applies only to PBH formed in the radiation dominated regime, i.e.\ for $M < M(N_\text{eq})$ with $N_\text{eq} \simeq N_\text{CMB} - 1.2$ labeling the primordial fluctuations entering the horizon at matter-radiation equality. However as these scales are strongly constrained by the CMB, we do not need to worry about this subtlety.} For example, for the curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} we find 
\begin{equation}
f_\text{tot}^{\varsigma = 45.7} = 98.6 \%,  \, \quad f_\text{tot}^{\varsigma = 55} = 39.4 \% , \, \quad f_\text{tot}^{\varsigma = 65.5} = 1.2 \cdot 10^{-4} \, \% \,.
\end{equation}
In summary, while for the $h(\phi) = \phi$ case the contribution to dark matter is completely negligible, PBHs can contribute a very significant fraction of dark matter for $h(\phi) = 1 - 1/\phi$ in this setup.

\subsection{Searching for PBHs with GW interferometers \label{app:GWs}}

PBHs can form binary objects which source GWs similar to the event observed by LIGO~\cite{Abbott:2016blz}. In this subsection, we address the question if these GWs may be observable in future GW interferometers, see also~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2017fdg}.  We will normalize the results of this subsection to $M = M_\odot = 1.99 \cdot 10^{33}$~g, which roughly corresponds to the brown curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} after taking into account the mass increase of the PBH during the matter dominated phase due to accretion and mergers (see App.~\ref{app:PBH}).

Let us first consider GW signal from inspiraling PBHs (see e.g.\ \cite{Maggiore:1900zz}). Comparing the orbital distance of two (point-like) objects rotating with frequency $\omega$,
\begin{equation}
R_\text{orb} = \left( G M_\text{sys} / \omega^2 \right)^{1/3} \,,
\end{equation}
where $G = 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{m}^3/(\text{kg} \, \text{s}^2)$ and $M_\text{sys}$ is the sum of the two masses, to the sum of the Schwarzschild radii,
\begin{equation}
R_\text{schw} = G M_\text{sys} /c^2 \,,
\end{equation}
we find for the peak frequency of the GW signal of a black hole binary, $f =  \omega/\pi$,
\begin{equation}
f_\text{max} \sim 6.4 \cdot 10^4 \text{ Hz } \left( \frac{2 \cdot M_\odot}{M_\text{sys}}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
For comparison, the  frequency band of LIGO extends to about few times $ 10^3$~Hz. In the early inspiral phase, the system will emit GWs at lower frequencies, thus potentially `crossing' the LIGO frequency band as the system approaches coalescence. 
The time $\tau$ between when signal is at the LIGO peak sensitivity of $f \sim 100$~Hz and coalescence is given by
\begin{equation}
\tau = 3 \, \text{s} \, \left( \frac{M_\odot}{M_c}\right)^{5/3} \left( \frac{100~\text{Hz}}{f} \right)^{8/3} \,,
\end{equation} 
where $M_c$ is the so-called chirp mass, $M_c^5 = (M_1 M_2)^3/(M_1 + M_2) $, constructed from the masses of the two individual BHs.
The amplitude of the emitted GWs, detected at a distance $r$ from the source is given by
\begin{equation}
h \simeq \frac{4}{r} \left( \frac{G M_c}{c^2} \right)^{5/3} \left(\frac{\pi f}{c} \right)^{2/3} \,.
\end{equation}
Comparing this to the strain sensitivity of advanced LIGO, $h \simeq 10^{-24}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016agk}, we find that assuming a bandwidth of 10~Hz, a signal originating from a binary BH system can be detected if a source is within 
\begin{equation}
r = 8.0 \cdot 10^2 \, \text{Mpc} \, \left( \frac{M_c}{M_\odot} \right)^{5/3} \left( \frac{f}{100 \text{ Hz}} \right)^{2/3} 
\label{eq:detectorreach}
\end{equation}
of the detector. For comparison, the size of the Milky Way is about 30 - 55 kpc and the size of the Virgo super cluster is about 33~Mpc. 
This has to be compared to the expected rate of BH mergers, which has been estimated to be~\cite{Bird:2016dcv,Clesse:2016vqa,Sasaki:2016jop}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma =  10^{-8} \, f_\text{tot} \, \delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc}\, \text{yr}^{-1}\,  \text{Gpc}^{-3} \,.
\label{eq:rate}
\end{equation}
Here $\delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc}$ denotes the local PBH density contrast, where $\delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc} = 1$ yields the expected merger rate if PBH are distributed uniformly throughout the universe. Clustering of PBHs into sub-halos may however increase the value to $\delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc} \sim 10^7 - 10^9$~\cite{Clesse:2016vqa}, dramatically enhancing the prospects for detection. Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:rate} is independent of the PBH mass, which drops out when combining the dark matter number density and the BH - BH capture cross section (see e.g.~\cite{Bird:2016dcv}). Hence for $M \sim M_\odot$ and $f_\text{tot} = {\cal O}(0.1)$ one might indeed expect a handful of these events per year at $f = 10^2$~Hz, baring in mind the huge uncertainty in $\delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc}$.  Note however that since the reach of the detector is sensitive to the PBH mass (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:detectorreach}), the total rate drops significantly for lighter PBHs.

In addition to the transcendent GWs signal from PBH binaries discussed above, there will also be a diffuse stochastic background arising from binaries which are too faint to be detected as individual sources. For a recent analysis see Ref.~\cite{Clesse:2016ajp}, where it was concluded that depending on the PBH merger rate (see above) and the shape of the PBH distribution, such a stochastic background might indeed be detectable by LISA.\footnote{In addition, the formation process of BPHs
may lead to a stochastic GW background similar to first order phase transitions~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2017fdg}. }



\subsection{Discussion}

The peaks of the mass distributions in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} are in an interesting mass region. In the lower mass region (pink and grey curves) the bounds on $f(M)$ are weaker (in particular if one omits the neutron star capture bound), and it becomes possible to account for a significant fraction, or maybe even all of dark matter, in PBHs. Moreover, the mass ranges found in these benchmark models lie below the lower bound expected from BHs formed in stellar evolution, $M \gtrsim 3 \, M_\odot$~\cite{Misner:1974qy}. If detected, such light BHs thus immediately point towards a possible primordial origin. On the other hand, the higher mass region (brown curve) provides PBHs which might be in the correct ballpark to be detected through their gravitational wave signatures in advanced LIGO. However, we emphasize that for the specific, simple choice of $h(\phi)$ discussed here, the abundance of PBHs in this mass range is strongly constrained by CMB observations, rendering a detection with LIGO very challenging even for large density contrasts~$\delta_\text{PBH}^\text{loc}$.
%



We stress that the spectra depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH2} are not a unique prediction but only three representative benchmark models. Clearly, varying the parameters (as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors}) the amplitude of this signal can be adjusted. Moreover, as can be seen by comparing Figs.~\ref{fig:BH1} and \ref{fig:BH2}, the position of the peak is very sensitive to the choice of the function $h(\phi)$. In this context, we point out that Ref.~\cite{Carr:2016drx} recently identified two interesting `windows' for PBH dark matter, in which dark matter could still consist of PBH to $100\%$. The lunar BH window $M_\text{PBH} \sim 10^{20} - 10^{24}~g$ opens when omitting the neutron star capture constraint, as mentioned above. The second window is located at $M_\text{PBH} \sim 1\,  M_\odot - 10^3 \, M_\odot$ (LIGO-like BHs) and may be reached by either considering more complicated functions $h(\phi)$ or by a better understanding of the accretion and merger processes in the matter dominated regime.
 

Given the different spectra depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:scalar}, one might wonder if a sizable PBH population might be achieved without invoking a non-minimal coupling to gravity, i.e.\ for $\varsigma = 0$. In this case the characteristic feature of the scalar spectrum is a plateau extending to small scales. The function $\beta(M)$ will hence also be constant, and the strongest constraint come from searches for anisotropies in the CMB and for anomalies in the (extra-) galactic photon background, restricting $\beta \lesssim 10^{-28}$ at $M \sim 10^{13}$~g~\cite{Carr:2009jm}. This implies $f \sim 10^{-20} \, (M_\odot/M)^{1/2}$. Integrating over the entire range which could contribute to PBHs, the lower bound $M > 5 \cdot 10^{14}~g $ dominates the integral leading to $f_\text{tot} \lesssim 10^{-11}$, i.e.\ a completely negligible fraction of dark matter. In the setup discussed here, the non-minimal coupling $\varsigma$ is hence essential to obtain a significant fraction of dark matter in PBHs.

\section{Introduction}

The type IIB Large Volume Scenario (LVS) for closed string moduli stabilisation \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx,Conlon:2005ki} has led to a theoretically well motivated class of phenomenological models of beyond the Standard Model physics \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk,deAlwis:2009fn,Baer:2010uy,deAlwis:2012cz,Aparicio:2014wxa}. 

According to the general analysis of \cite{Cicoli:2008va}, LVS supersymmetry breaking AdS minima exist whenever the compactification manifold is a Calabi-Yau (CY) with negative Euler number ($h^{1,2}> h^{1,1}$) and at least one blow-up mode resolving a point-like singularity.\footnote{LVS vacua with positive Euler number might be obtained by allowing some tuning in string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}.} Each blow-up mode (together with its axionic partner) is fixed by non-perturbative effects at a small size of order the inverse string coupling, $\tau_s\sim g_s^{-1}$, while the overall volume is stabilised at exponentially large values, ${V} \sim e^{-1/g_s}$, by the interplay between $\alpha'^3$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential $K$ \cite{Becker:2002nn} and non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential $W$ \cite{Kachru:2003aw}.\footnote{The dilaton and the complex structure moduli are instead fixed by background fluxes as in \cite{Giddings:2001yu}. For references to earlier work see the references therein and the reviews \cite{Grana:2005jc,Douglas:2006es}.}

In the presence of $N_{\rm small}$ small blow-up modes, at leading order in an expansion in inverse powers of the overall volume, there are $N_{\rm flat}= h^{1,1}-N_{\rm small}-1$ flat directions left over. In principle these can be lifted via either non-perturbative effects in $W$ or perturbative corrections to $K$. However \cite{Cicoli:2008va} showed that only perturbative contributions to $K$ can be used since non-perturbative effects are either subdominant if the $N_{\rm flat}$ moduli are larger than the $N_{\rm small}$ blow-up modes, or cannot yield a minimum in a region where the effective field theory can be trusted if the $N_{\rm flat}$ moduli are small, i.e. of the same size of the $N_{\rm small}$ blow-up modes. Hence ref. \cite{Cicoli:2008va} focused on the case where each of these remaining $N_{\rm flat}$ moduli is larger than the $N_{\rm small}$ blow-up modes (but not necessarily as large as the overall volume), i.e. $N_{\rm flat}= N_{\rm large}-1$, and argued that all the $N_{\rm flat}$ directions should be lifted via the inclusion of string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp} since they generically introduce a dependence on all K\"ahler moduli at subleading order and the overall volume has already been fixed at leading order (hence we do not expect any destabilisation due to subdominant effects). Some explicit examples where remaining flat directions are lifted by string loops are given in \cite{Cicoli:2007xp,Cicoli:2008va} but, as we discuss later, it is difficult to give a general argument. 

As pointed out in \cite{Cicoli:2011it}, blow-up modes resolving a point-like singularity diagonalise the volume form, and so the case where $N_{\rm flat}=0$ corresponds to so-called `strong Swiss-cheese' CY manifolds whose volume looks like \cite{Gray:2012jy}:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \tau_b^{3/2}-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}}\lambda_i\tau_i^{3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
Globally consistent LVS chiral compactifications with branes and fluxes and this type of CY manifold have been constructed in \cite{CYembedding}. 

On the other hand cases with $N_{\rm flat}>0$ involve `weak Swiss-cheese' CY manifolds with volume \cite{Cicoli:2011it}:
\begin{equation}
{V} = f_{3/2}(\tau_j)-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}}\lambda_i\tau_i^{3/2}\,,
\label{weak}
\end{equation}
where $f_{3/2}(\tau_j)$ is a homogeneous function of degree $3/2$ in the variables $\tau_j$, $j=1,...,N_{\rm large}=N_{\rm flat}+1 = h^{1,1}-N_{\rm small}$. Globally consistent LVS chiral brane models with this type of CY manifolds have been built in \cite{Cicoli:2011qg}. The simplest examples with $N_{\rm flat}=1$ are K3 or $T^4$ fibrations over a $\mathbb{P}^1$ base where $f_{3/2}(\tau_1,\tau_2)=\sqrt{\tau_1}\tau_2$ \cite{Cicoli:2011it}. These simple `weak Swiss-cheese' CY manifolds have been used both in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} to develop a promising inflationary scenario called `Fibre Inflation' which predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of order $r\simeq 0.006$, and in \cite{Cicoli:2011yy} to obtain anisotropic compactifications with effectively 2 micron-sized extra dimensions and TeV scale strings. 

Following the philosophy of \cite{Cicoli:2008va}, the inflationary potential of Fibre Inflation is generated by string loop corrections which are naturally smaller than $\alpha'^3$ effects due to the extended no-scale structure \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. This is a cancellation of the leading order loop contribution to the scalar potential which is due to supersymmetry and has two important implications for the naturalness of the inflationary model: ($i$) being a leading order flat direction, the inflaton is naturally lighter than the Hubble scale during inflation, ($ii$) potentially dangerous higher dimensional operators do not cause an $\eta$-problem since the inflaton enjoys an approximate non-compact shift symmetry \cite{Burgess:2014tja, Burgess:2016owb}. In fact the no-scale feature of type IIB models ensures that at tree-level the potential is invariant under rescaling symmetries which correspond to non-compact shift symmetries for the K\"ahler moduli. This symmetry is approximate since it gets broken by string loop effects. Hence inflaton-dependent higher dimensional operators get generated but they are suppressed by the symmetry breaking parameter which turns out to be small since string loops are both $g_s$ and ${V}$-suppressed with respect to the tree-level contribution. 

Despite these very promising features, the potential of Fibre Inflation is not under full control since string loop effects in $K$ can be explicitly computed only for simple toroidal cases \cite{Berg:2005ja}. However in order to stabilise the remaining flat direction and develop the inflationary potential, one needs to know just the K\"ahler moduli dependence of these corrections which is the simplest to estimate, together with the dependence on the dilaton $S$ (since $\langle {\rm Re} (S)\rangle = g_s^{-1}$), in contrast to the dependence on the complex structure moduli $U$ which is already rather complicated even in the toroidal case. In fact, the $S$ and $U$-moduli are fixed at semi-classical level by background fluxes \cite{Giddings:2001yu}, and so, at this level of approximation, can be considered just as flux-dependent constants. The K\"ahler moduli dependence of string 1-loop corrections to $K$ for an arbitrary CY manifold can be estimated by both generalising the toroidal result \cite{Berg:2007wt} and matching to the low-energy Coleman-Weinberg potential \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. Moreover, due to the extended no-scale cancellation, 1-loop corrections are smaller than expected and turn out to be effectively of the same order as 2-loop effects. Even if perturbation theory is still under control since the expansion parameter is small (for $g_s\ll 1$ and ${V} \gg 1$), a full treatment of the inflationary potential should include also 2-loop effects. Even if these have been estimated to have the same inflaton dependence as the first non-vanishing 1-loop effect \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, and so should not modify the final results of Fibre Inflation, it is important to look for additional perturbative effects that could stabilise these flat directions.

These additional terms can arise from higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. These new $F^4$ terms depend on all $h^{1,1}$ K\"ahler moduli and can be shown to lift all of them except for the overall volume mode for an arbitrary CY manifold. In \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} a full minimum has been achieved for positive CY Euler number ($h^{1,2}< h^{1,1}$) by fixing the volume via balancing $F^2$ against $F^4$ $\alpha'^3$ effects. However since the minimum is obtained by comparing two different orders in the superspace derivative expansion, the effective field theory does not seem to be fully under control, resulting in a gravitino mass of order the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}.\footnote{Given that the higher derivative expansion at ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ involves terms just up to $F^8$, one might still hope to keep it under control.} 

In this paper we show how to overcome at the same time both this control issue and the difficulty of showing explicitly that any flat direction in LVS models can be lifted by string loops for a generic CY manifold with at least one blow-up mode. This can be done by including $F^4$ terms in the LVS scenario where the overall volume mode is stabilised at order $F^2$ by balancing $\alpha'^3$ against non-perturbative effects. All the $N_{\rm flat}= N_{\rm large}-1$ remaining flat directions can then be lifted at subleading $F^4$ order by the inclusion of the higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ effects computed in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. This demonstrates that the class of phenomenologically viable LVS models extends well beyond the original framework in which there was only one large K\"ahler modulus. Given that string loop corrections to the scalar potential scale as $V_{g_s}\sim g_s W_0^2 {V}^{-10/3}$ whereas higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ effects behave as $V_{F^4}\sim g_s^{1/2} W_0^4 {V}^{-11/3}$, string loops can be safely neglected only for relatively small values of the internal volume: ${V} \ll W_0^6 g_s^{-3/2}$. As a reference example, natural values $g_s\simeq 0.1$ and $W_0\simeq 20$ would give ${V}\ll 10^9$. 

The minimum is again AdS but it can be uplifted to dS by using various mechanisms already proposed in the literature.\footnote{An important feature of LVS models is that the negative vacuum energy is parametrically below the gravitino mass, and so the final phenomenology is not affected at leading order by the specific uplift mechanism.} Some of the most popular ways to achieve dS vacua involve anti-branes \cite{Kachru:2003aw, deAlwis:2016cty}, T-branes \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} (or hidden matter F-terms \cite{CYembedding}) and non-perturbative effects at singularities \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}.

Besides moduli stabilisation, a very interesting application of $F^4$ terms is inflation. Ref. \cite{Broy:2015zba} followed the same philosophy of the Fibre Inflation model developed in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} and focused on simple K3 or $T^4$-fibred CY manifolds with $h^{1,1}=3$, $N_{\rm small}=1$, $N_{\rm large}=2$ and so $N_{\rm flat}=1$ flat direction which can play the r\^ole of the inflaton. After showing that higher derivative terms alone cannot yield a potential which is flat enough to drive inflation, \cite{Broy:2015zba} combined $F^4$ terms with string loop effects due to the exchange of KK closed strings between stacks of non-intersecting branes and neglected $g_s$ corrections coming from the exchange of winding modes between intersecting stacks of branes. This can be justified if the underlying brane set-up does not involve intersecting branes.\footnote{Or more precisely if each intersection locus does not admit non-contractible 1-cycles \cite{Berg:2007wt}.} However, the leading order KK 1-loop correction to the scalar potential vanishes due to extended no-scale \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}, and so the first non-zero contribution scales effectively as 2-loop KK effects whose form is poorly understood. The final prediction for the cosmological observables reproduces the result $r= 2 (f/M_p)^2 (n_s-1)^2$ of generalised Fibre Inflation models with a potential of the form $V=V_0-V_1\,e^{-\phi/f}$ \cite{Burgess:2016owb}. The effective decay constant $f$ can be either equal to the one of the original Fibre Inflation model, $f=f_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm FI}=\sqrt{3} M_p$, or smaller, $f=f_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm FI}/2$, depending on whether the plateau region of the potential is generated by $F^4$ or KK loops. Hence the tensor-to-scalar ratio turns out to be $r\lesssim 0.006$.

On the other hand ref. \cite{Cicoli:2015wja} considered the single modulus case and combined $F^2$ and $F^4$ $\alpha'^3$ contributions with $g_s$ effects and different uplifting terms to have enough freedom to develop a potential for the volume mode which features, together with a dS minimum, also an inflection point supporting inflation. In this way the volume mode can evolve from the end of inflaton to its present value, allowing for larger values of the gravitino mass during inflation. 

In this paper, we consider a different cosmological application of $F^4$ terms which is under better control and leads to a larger prediction for tensor modes. We focus again on LVS models where the CY manifold has a simple fibred structure with $N_{\rm flat}=1$ flat direction which is lifted by the inclusion of both $F^4$ terms and winding loop corrections. KK loop effects can be absent by construction if, for example, the compactification does not include any O3-plane and D3-brane and all O7-planes and D7-branes intersect or are on top of each other \cite{Berg:2007wt}. If instead KK $g_s$ effects get generated, being effectively 2-loop contributions, they can be neglected with respect to 1-loop winding corrections due to the additional suppression factor $g_s^2\ll 1$ \cite{Burgess:2016owb}. In this way, we do not have to worry about poorly understood 2-loop KK corrections. 

The resulting inflationary model features a plateau followed by a steepening region similar to Fibre Inflation-like models \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Broy:2015zba}. However the inflationary dynamics is qualitatively different since the plateau is longer and the steepening behaviour at large inflaton values is milder. Given that horizon exit cannot take place in the plateau region for natural values of the underlying parameters, the general relation $r= 2 (f/M_p)^2 (n_s-1)^2$ is generically not satisfied in this class of models. Given that horizon exit is close to the steepening region, the final prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is larger, $r\simeq 0.01$, and could be tested by forthcoming cosmological observations \cite{rForecasts}. Notice that such a large value of $r$ can never be obtained in Fibre Inflation models since, even if the microscopic parameters are tuned to have horizon exit close to the region where the potential starts to raise, the spectral index would become too blue. This is avoided in our model since the steepening is milder. Given that our model is qualitatively different from Fibre Inflation, we name it `$\alpha'$-Inflation' to distinguish it from Fibre Inflation and to stress that $\alpha'$ effects play a crucial r\^ole to develop the inflationary potential (both $F^4$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ and $F^2$ ${O}(\alpha'^4 g_s^2)$ effects). Notice however that the flatness of the inflationary potential is again protected by the same approximate non-compact shift symmetry as in Fibre Inflation-like models. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{Section1} we show how any remaining flat direction in the LVS scenario can be lifted by $F^4$ terms for an arbitrary CY manifold with at least one blow-up mode. In Sec. \ref{Sec2} we then focus on the particular LVS case with just one remaining flat direction and present a viable inflationary model that leads to observable tensors of order $r\simeq 0.01$ by taking into account $F^4$ corrections as well as 1-loop winding string corrections. After presenting our conclusions in Sec. \ref{Concl}, in App. \ref{AppB} we show that the form of the $F^4$ terms derived in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} for a constant superpotential applies also in LVS models up to volume-suppressed corrections coming from non-perturbative effects in $W$ that mildly break the underlying no-scale structure.



\section{LVS with higher derivative terms}
\label{Section1}

In this section, after a very brief review of the standard LVS scenario, we first introduce higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ corrections and then show that they can lift any direction which remains flat at leading order. 

\subsection{Standard LVS vacua}

Let us focus on a weak Swiss-cheese CY manifold $X$ with $N_{\rm small}$ blow-up modes, $N_{\rm large}=h^{1,1}-N_{\rm small}$ large moduli and volume of the form (\ref{weak}). After dilaton and complex structure moduli stabilisation at semi-classical level by background fluxes, the 4D K\"ahler potential $K$ and superpotential $W$ for the K\"ahler moduli $T_i$, $i=1,...,h^{1,1}(X)$, in Einstein frame look like:\footnote{See appendix A of \cite{Burgess:2010bz} for the correct prefactor of $W$ which reproduces the corresponding terms in the 10D supergravity action.}
\begin{equation}
\frac{K}{M_p^2} = -2\ln\left({V}+\frac{\xi}{2 g_s^{3/2}}\right)+\ln\left(\frac{g_s}{2}\right)+K_{\rm c.s.},\qquad 
\frac{W}{M_p^3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\left(W_0+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}} A_i\,e^{-a_i T_i}\right),
\label{4DEFT}
\end{equation}
where ${V}$ is the Einstein frame volume of $X$ in units of $\ell_s=2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'}$, $\xi= -\chi\zeta(3)/2(2\pi)^3$ controls the leading order ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ correction (for typical CY manifolds $\xi\sim {O}(1)$) and:
\begin{equation}
W_0 = \frac{1}{\ell_s^2}\int_X G_3\wedge \Omega\,.
\end{equation}
Setting $M_p=e^{K_{\rm cs}}=1$ and considering without loss of generality the case with $N_{\rm small}=1$ and real $W_0$ and $A_s$, the resulting F-term supergravity scalar potential at leading order is:\footnote{We ignore the D-term potential as well as the F-term contribution of matter fields.}
\begin{equation}
V_\LVS = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)\left[\frac83 (a_s A_s)^{2}\frac{\sqrt{\tau_s} e^{-2a_s\tau_s}}{{V}}- 4 a_s A_s W_0\frac{\tau_s e^{-a_s\tau_s}}{{V}^2}  + \frac{3\xi W_0^2}{4 g_s^{3/2} {V}^3}\right].
\label{VLVS}
\end{equation} 
Extremising with respect to $\tau_s$ and ${V}$ we obtain: 
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac{W_0}{a_s A_s}f(\tau_s)\,e^{a_s\tau_s},
\qquad \frac43\sqrt{\tau_s}f^2(\tau_s)-4\tau_s f(\tau_s)+\frac98 \frac{\xi}{g_s^{3/2}} = 0\,.
\label{extreme}
\end{equation}
where (defining $\epsilon_s\equiv 1/(4 a_s\tau_s)\ll 1$):
\begin{equation}
f(\tau_s) = \frac34 \sqrt{\tau_s}\frac{1-4\epsilon_s}{1-\epsilon_s}\simeq\frac34\sqrt{\tau_s}\left[1-3\epsilon_s+{O}\left(\epsilon_s^2\right)\right]\,.
\label{eq:ftau}
\end{equation}
Thus the volume is determined essentially by the well known LVS result:
\begin{equation}
\ln\left(\frac{{V}}{W_0}\right)\simeq\frac{a_s}{g_s}\left(\frac{\xi}{2}\right)^{2/3}\,.
\label{eq:LVSvol}
\end{equation}
The minimum of the potential is AdS:
\begin{equation}
\langle V_\LVS\rangle=\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{4 W_0^2}{3{V}^3}\left(\frac43\sqrt{\tau_s}f^2(\tau_s)- \tau_s f(\tau_s)\right)\simeq
-\frac{3\xi\epsilon_s}{2 g_s^{3/2}}\frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,,
\label{eq:Vlvs}
\end{equation}
with ${V}$ and $\tau_s$ determined by \eqref{extreme} and \eqref{eq:LVSvol} and the squared gravitino mass is:
\begin{equation}
m_{3/2}^2=e^K |W|^2 \simeq \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\,.
\end{equation}
The mass of the moduli is of order (denoting the axions with $c_i$):
\begin{equation}
m_{\tau_s}^2 \sim m_{c_s}^2 \sim  m_{3/2}^2  \gg m_{{V}}^2 \sim \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \gg m_{c_{V}}^2\sim M_p^2\,e^{- a_b {V}^{2/3}}\sim 0\,.
\end{equation}
The potential at the LVS minimum given in \eqref{eq:Vlvs} is negative (since $\xi$ needs to be positive), though supersymmetry is broken. There are different uplift mechanisms discussed in the literature to get a dS (or Minkowski) minimum (for more details see \cite{Kachru:2003aw, deAlwis:2016cty,CYembedding, Cicoli:2012fh,Cicoli:2015ylx}).

Notice that the potential (\ref{VLVS}) depends on just the overall volume mode ${V}$ and any possible small blow-up mode present in the compactification. Hence at this order of approximation, $N_{\rm flat} = h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small} -1$ directions will remain flat. 

\subsection{Higher derivative corrections}

The discussion so far has only included the leading ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ correction to the K\"ahler potential worked out in \cite{Becker:2002nn} and given in (\ref{4DEFT}) by the term proportional to $\xi$. This correction is at order $F^2$ and, together with non-perturbative effects in $W$, can stabilise the volume and all small K\"ahler moduli, leaving however several flat directions in spaces with more than one large modulus. There are two known types of subdominant corrections which may be included to stabilise these flat directions: higher derivative ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ terms and string loop effects. We now briefly review $\alpha'^3$ $F^4$ corrections and discuss string loops in Sec. \ref{Loops}. 

The effective ten-dimensional action of type IIB is corrected by $(\alpha')^3$ eight-derivative terms. In particular, this includes the well-known $R^4$-term \cite{Gross:1986iv} that leads upon KK-reduction to the $\xi$-correction to the K\"ahler potential which was worked out in \cite{Becker:2002nn}. Similarly, this term sources four-derivative terms for the K\"ahler moduli which were computed in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. In this reference, these terms were then matched to a particular supersymmetric higher-derivative operator. Thereby, supersymmetry demands the existence of $F^4$-type corrections to the scalar potential.\footnote{By means of the no-scale property it can be shown that these are the only higher-derivative corrections to the scalar potential that can occur at this order \cite{Ciupke:2016agp}.} The final form of these $F^4$-corrections reads:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} = -\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)^2 \frac{\lambda \lvert W_0 \lvert^4}{g_s^{3/2}{V}^4}\,\Pi_i t_i\,,
\label{PotF4}
\end{equation}
where the $t_i$ denote the volumes of 2-cycles and the $\Pi_i$ are topological integers defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_m=\int_X c_2\wedge\hat{D}_m\,,
\label{eq:Pi}
\end{equation}
where $c_2$ is the second Chern class and $\hat{D}_m$ form a basis of harmonic 2-forms in terms of which the K\"ahler form can be expanded as $J=t_i\hat{D}_i$. Furthermore, $\lambda$ is a combinatorial number which could not be determined in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. Note that $\Pi_i t_i \geq 0$, and so in a K\"ahler cone basis where $t_i \geq 0$ individually for all $i=1,\cdots,h^{1,1}$, all the $\Pi_i$ are also non-negative.

Two comments regarding eq.~\eqref{PotF4} are in order. Firstly, because the matching in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} was performed only for a single higher-derivative operator, and not the most general combination of mutually non-equivalent supersymmetric higher-derivative operators, the overall prefactor $\lambda$ is undetermined. One may naively estimate it to be of the same order as the combinatorial prefactor of the $\xi$-correction appearing in the K\"ahler potential and, hence, to be of the order $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$. Secondly, eq.~\eqref{PotF4} was determined using the leading order no-scale property which is valid when $W=W_0$ in (\ref{4DEFT}). However, since we want to include non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential in our analysis, the derivation of \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} has to be revisited in order to estimate the effect of additional $F^4$ corrections associated to these non-perturbative contributions. We perform this computation in App. \ref{AppB}. The result is that for a Swiss-Cheese CY manifold whose small moduli are integrated out following the LVS construction of the previous section, eq.~\eqref{PotF4} still holds up to further volume-suppressed corrections and $\lambda$ becomes a function of these small cycles. Since the precise functional form of $\lambda$ cannot be determined, we continue to treat it is a constant and use the aforementioned estimate.

\subsection{Lifting flat directions via $F^4$ terms}
\label{Sec1}

In this section we show that the higher derivative corrections given in (\ref{PotF4}) can lift any remaining flat direction in the LVS scenario for an arbitrary CY manifold whose volume in terms of the 2-cycle moduli looks like:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac16 \sum_{i,j,k=1}^{N_{\rm large}} k_{ijk} t_i t_j t_k - \frac16 \sum_{s=1}^{N_{\rm small}} k_{sss} t_s^3 \,,
\label{VolForm}
\end{equation}
where the intersection numbers are defined as:
\begin{equation}
k_{ijk} = \int_X \hat{D}_i \wedge \hat{D}_j \wedge \hat{D}_k\,,
\end{equation}
and the small blow-up modes, being exceptional divisors, are characterised by the K\"ahler cone conditions $t_s<0$ $\forall\, s=1,\cdots,N_{\rm small}$. Non-perturbative corrections and $F^2$ $\alpha'^3$ effects fix both ${V}$ and all $t_s$'s but not the remaining $N_{\rm flat}=N_{\rm large}-1$ directions. 

Let us now show that higher derivative terms can lift all these remaining flat directions. The total potential is the sum of the LVS potential (\ref{VLVS}), the $F^4$ term (\ref{PotF4}) and an additional contribution for dS uplift:
\begin{equation}
V= V_\LVS ({V}, t_s) + V_{F^4} (t_i,t_s) + V_{\rm up}({V}) \qquad\text{with}\qquad V_{\rm up}({V}) = \frac{\kappa}{{V}^\alpha}\,,
\end{equation}
where $0<\alpha<3$ and $\kappa$ is a positive model-dependent coefficient which is generically a function of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli. Notice that we highlighted the dependence on the 2-cycle, instead of the 4-cycle, moduli since the $F^4$ term is given explicitly as a function of the 2-cycle moduli and for a generic CY it is not possible to invert the relation $\tau_i = \frac12 k_{ijk} t_j t_k$. 

Given that the LVS potential scales as $V_\LVS \sim {O}({V}^{-3})$ while the $t_s$-dependent part of the $F^4$ potential scales as ${O}({V}^{-4})$, for ${V}\ll 1$ we can safely ignore the $t_s$-dependent piece in (\ref{PotF4}) and start by integrating out the small blow-up modes using the first relation in (\ref{extreme}). We obtain (neglecting ${O}(\epsilon_s^2)$ corrections and defining $\hat\xi\equiv \xi\,g_s^{-3/2}$ and $\hat\lambda\equiv 3^4\lambda\,g_s^{-3/2}$):
\begin{equation}
V = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)\frac{3W_0^2}{2 {V}^3}\left(\frac{\hat\xi}{2}- \tau_s({V})^{3/2}\right)  -\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)^2 \frac{\hat\lambda W_0^4}{{V}^4}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm large}}\Pi_i t_i +\frac{\kappa}{{V}^\alpha}\,,
\label{TotPot}
\end{equation}
where from (\ref{extreme}) we have that:
\begin{equation}
\tau_s({V})\simeq \frac{1}{a_s}\,\ln\left(\frac{{V}}{W_0}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Writing $V_\LVS({V}) + V_{\rm up}({V}) = \hat{V}({V})$, we minimise with respect to the $t_i$'s by imposing:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t_i} = \frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}\,\tau_i + \frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i} = 0\,.
\label{VI}
\end{equation}
where (defining $c \equiv g_s/(8\pi)$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}} = -\frac{9 c W_0^2}{2{V}^4} \left( \frac{\hat\xi}{2}-\tau_s({V})^{3/2}\left(1-2\epsilon_s\right)\right)
-\frac{\alpha\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+1}}\,,
\label{hatVvo}
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i} = \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{{V}^4}\left(\frac{\Pi_k t_k}{{V}}\,4\tau_i-\Pi_i\right)\,.
\label{ttVI}
\end{equation}
Using the fact that $3{V}=t_i\tau_i$, (\ref{VI}) gives:
\begin{equation}
0 = t_i\,\frac{\partial V}{\partial t_i} = 3{V}\,\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}+ t_i\,\frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i}\,,
\end{equation}
which from (\ref{ttVI}) implies:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}} = - \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{3{V}^5}\left(\frac{\Pi_k t_k}{{V}}\,4t_i \tau_i-\Pi_i t_i\right)
= - \frac{11 c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{3{V}^5}\, \Pi_k t_k\,.
\label{Fixvo}
\end{equation}
Thus (\ref{VI}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Pi_k t_k}{{V}}\,4\tau_i-\Pi_i = \frac{11}{3} \frac{\Pi_k t_k}{{V}} \tau_i
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \tau_i = \frac{3{V}}{\Pi_k t_k}\, \Pi_i\,.
\label{VInew}
\end{equation}
The solution determines $N_{\rm flat} = N_{\rm large}-1$ moduli in terms of any one of them (say $\tau_*$) and is then given by (recall that all $\Pi_i$'s are positive):
\begin{equation}
\tau_\alpha =\frac{\Pi_\alpha}{\Pi_*}\,\tau_*({V})\qquad\forall\,\alpha=1,\cdots,N_{\rm flat}=N_{\rm large}-1\,,
\label{Solu}
\end{equation}
where all the remaining flat directions are fixed in terms of the overall volume mode since after (\ref{Solu}) is imposed, we have:
\begin{equation}
\tau_*({V}) = h(k_{ijk},\Pi_i)\, {V}^{2/3}\,,
\label{taustar}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is a function of the intersection numbers $k_{ijk}$ and the topological quantities $\Pi_i$. The volume mode is fixed by (\ref{Fixvo}) which can be written using (\ref{VInew}) and (\ref{taustar}) as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}  =- \frac{11 c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4 \Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{14/3}} \,.
\label{FixVo}
\end{equation}
The effective field theory is under control when $F^4$ contributions are subdominant with respect to $F^2$ terms, i.e. when $\hat{V}\gg V_{F^4}$. In this regime, (\ref{FixVo}) gives rise just to a small shift of the minimum for the volume obtained just by setting at leading order $\hat{V}_{V}=0$. The solution to (\ref{FixVo}) is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\hat\xi}{2}&=&\tau_s({V})^{3/2}\left(1-2\epsilon_s\right) -\frac{2\alpha\kappa}{9c W_0^2}{V}^{3-\alpha}+ \frac{22 c\hat\lambda\,W_0^2 \Pi_*}{9 {V}^{2/3}} \nonumber \\ 
&\simeq& \tau_s({V})^{3/2}-\frac{2\alpha\kappa}{9c W_0^2}{V}^{3-\alpha}\qquad\text{for}\quad{V}\gg 1\,.
\label{NewSol}
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting this result into the total potential (\ref{TotPot}) together with (\ref{VInew}), a vanishing vacuum energy requires (up to ${O}(\epsilon_s^2)$ corrections):
\begin{equation}
\langle V\rangle =-\frac{3 c W_0^2}{{V}^3} \epsilon_s \tau_s({V})^{3/2} + \frac{2 c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4 \Pi_*}{3 h\,{V}^{11/3}} 
+\frac{\kappa(3-\alpha)}{3{V}^\alpha}=0\,.
\label{TotPotVEV}
\end{equation}
Notice that $0<\alpha<3$ in order to be able to cancel the negative leading order contribution. Substituting in (\ref{NewSol}) the value of $\kappa$ obtained from (\ref{TotPotVEV}), we find:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat\xi}{2}=\tau_s({V})^{3/2}\left(1-\frac{6\,\epsilon_s}{3-\alpha}+{O}\left(\epsilon_s^2\right)\right)
+ 2 c\hat\lambda\,W_0^2 \frac{\Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{2/3}}\left(1 + \frac{2}{3 (3 - \alpha)}\right)\simeq \tau_s({V})^{3/2}\,,
\label{NewSolu}
\end{equation}
implying that $\hat\xi>0$ regardless of the uplifting mechanism.\footnote{Notice however that in cases where $\alpha$ is very close to $3$, the term in (\ref{NewSolu}) proportional to $\epsilon_s$ could dominate giving solutions for $\hat\xi<0$. For example in dS vacua from hidden matter F-terms $\alpha=8/3$ \cite{CYembedding, Cicoli:2015ylx}, implying that $\hat\xi<0$ requires $\epsilon_s>1/18$, or equivalently $a_s\tau_s<4.5$, which in turn implies ${V} < 90\,W_0$. This is clearly a tuned situation where the expansion in $\epsilon_s$ is not fully under control and ${V}$ cannot be very large.}

Let us now show that this is indeed a minimum by looking at the Hessian (for $A_{ij}\equiv \frac{\partial \tau_i}{\partial t_j}$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = \frac{\partial^2 \hat{V}}{\partial {V}^2}\,\tau_i\tau_j +\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}\, A_{ij}+ \frac{\partial^2 V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i \partial t_j}\,,
\label{VIJ}
\end{equation}
where (up to ${O}(\epsilon_s^2)$ corrections):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \hat{V}}{\partial {V}^2} = \frac{18 c W_0^2}{{V}^5} \left(\frac{\hat\xi}{2}-\tau_s({V})^{3/2}\left(1-7\epsilon_s\right)\right)+\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+2}}\,,
\label{hatVvovo}
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = \frac{4c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{{V}^5}\left[\Pi_k t_k \left(A_{ij} -\frac{5}{{V}}\tau_i\tau_j\right)+ \left(\Pi_i\tau_j + \Pi_j\tau_i\right) \right]\,.
\end{equation}
Using (\ref{VInew}) and (\ref{Solu}), the second derivative of $V_{F^4}$ with respect to the $t_i$'s becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V_{F^4}}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = \frac{4c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4\Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{17/3}}\left(3{V} A_{ij}-  13\tau_i\tau_j \right).
\end{equation}
Plugging this result back in (\ref{VIJ}) together with (\ref{FixVo}) we find:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = \frac{\partial^2 \hat{V}}{\partial {V}^2}\,\tau_i\tau_j 
+ \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4\Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{17/3}}\left({V} A_{ij}-  52\tau_i\tau_j \right) \,.
\label{VIJnew}
\end{equation}
Recalling (see for example \cite{Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp}) that at leading order $K^{-1}_{ij}=4\left(\tau_i\tau_j-{V} A_{ij}\right)$, we end up with:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = c_1 \,\tau_i\tau_j+c_2 \,K^{-1}_{ij} \,,
\label{VIJfinal}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
c_1 = \frac{\partial^2 \hat{V}}{\partial {V}^2} - \frac{51c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4\Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{17/3}}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad c_2 = - \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4\Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{17/3}} \,.
\label{c1c2}
\end{equation}
For $\hat\lambda=0$, $c_2=0$ while the coefficient $c_1$ is clearly positive since the leading order LVS dynamics gives a minimum for the volume direction. Thus the Hessian at leading order is just given by the matrix $M_{ij}\equiv \tau_i\tau_j$ which is semi-positive definite with one positive and $N_{\rm flat}$ vanishing eigenvalues since ${\rm Det}\left(M-x\mathbb{I}\right) = (-1)^{N_{\rm large}} x^{N_{\rm flat}} \left(x- \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm large}} \tau_i^2\right)$. This clearly signals the presence of $N_{\rm flat}$ directions which can be lifted at subleading order when $\hat\lambda\neq 0$. In this case the coefficient $c_1$ just gets slightly shifted regardless of the sign of $\hat\lambda$ since its expression at the minimum (\ref{NewSolu}) reads: 
\begin{equation}
c_1 = \frac{c W_0^2}{{V}^5}\left[ 9(10- \alpha) \epsilon_s \tau_s({V})^{3/2} - (7-2\alpha) \frac{c\hat\lambda\,W_0^2 \Pi_*}{h\,{V}^{2/3}}\right]
\simeq 9(10- \alpha) c W_0^2\frac{\epsilon_s \tau_s({V})^{3/2}}{{V}^5}>0\,, \nonumber
\end{equation}
where we took the limit ${V}\gg 1$. On the other hand, given that the inverse K\"ahler metric is positive definite, we need to require $\hat\lambda<0$ in order to have $c_2>0$ and obtain a global minimum. Notice that, depending on the sign of $\hat\lambda$, one can have either a global minimum (for $\hat\lambda<0$) or a saddle point with $N_{\rm flat}$ tachyonic directions (for $\hat\lambda>0$). We have therefore shown that for $\hat\lambda<0$ the Hessian is positive definite and all the remaining flat directions can be lifted by the $F^4$ terms which develop a stable global minimum for an arbitrary CY manifold with at least one blow-up mode.

Notice that the stabilisation of the $N_{\rm flat}$ flat directions is qualitatively similar to the results of \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} while the volume is fixed differently. In fact, the $F^4$ terms can fix in general all K\"ahler moduli except for the breathing mode. The volume has to be fixed by different dynamics. In \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} the volume was fixed by balancing $F^2$ against $F^4$ corrections due to the absence of non-perturbative effects, while here we are fixing the volume at $F^2$ order and the $F^4$ effects give rise just to a small shift of the volume mode. Therefore in our approach the superspace derivative expansion is under control and the gravitino mass is suppressed with respect to the Kaluza-Klein scale \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}. The fact that the stabilisation of the large moduli `orthogonal' to ${V}$ is just due to $F^4$ terms can be clearly seen by trading the variables $t_i$ for $(t_\alpha,{V})$ where $\alpha=1,\cdots, N_{\rm flat}$ so that:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t_\alpha} = \frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_\alpha} - \frac{\tau_\alpha}{\tau_*} \frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_*} 
= \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{{V}^4}\left(\Pi_*\frac{\tau_\alpha}{\tau_*}-\Pi_\alpha\right)=0\,,
\label{Pi}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial {V}} = \frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}+\frac{1}{\tau_*} \frac{\partial V_{F^4}}{\partial t_*}= \frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}}+\frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4}{{V}^4\tau_*}\left(\frac{\Pi_k t_k}{{V}}\,4\tau_*-\Pi_*\right)=0\,.
\label{Pvo}
\end{equation}
The solution to (\ref{Pi}) is given by (\ref{Solu}) showing that the $F^4$ potential is responsible for lifting the $N_{\rm flat}=N_{\rm large}-1$ flat directions. On the other hand, (\ref{Pvo}) is equivalent to (\ref{FixVo}) since substituting (\ref{Solu}) and (\ref{taustar}) in (\ref{Pvo}) and using $3{V}=t_i\tau_i$, we end up with:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}} = - \frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4 \Pi_* }{{V}^4\tau_*}\left[\frac{4}{{V}}\left(t_\alpha \tau_\alpha + t_*\tau_*\right)-1\right]= -11\frac{c^2\hat\lambda\,W_0^4 \Pi_* }{h\,{V}^{14/3}}\,.
\label{Pu}
\end{equation}
In our case $\hat{V}$ has a minimum at leading order by balancing non-perturbative against $F^2$ $\alpha'^3$ effects. On the other hand, in the absence of non-perturbative effects, as can be seen from (\ref{hatVvo}) by setting $\tau_s=0$, $\hat{V}$ has just a maximum since:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \hat{V}}{\partial {V}} = -\frac{9 c W_0^2}{2{V}^4} \frac{\hat\xi}{2}-\frac{\alpha\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+1}}=0\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad 
\frac{c W_0^2}{{V}^4} \frac{\hat\xi}{2}=-\frac29 \frac{\alpha\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+1}}\,,
\end{equation}
and for $\kappa>0$ and $0<\alpha<3$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \hat{V}}{\partial {V}^2} = \frac{18 c W_0^2}{{V}^5} \frac{\hat\xi}{2}+\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+2}}=-\frac{\alpha\,\kappa}{{V}^{\alpha+2}}\left(3-\alpha\right)<0\,.
\end{equation}
In order to have a stable minimum, the $F^4$ term in (\ref{Pu}) has to become dominant and compete with the $F^2$ contribution. Given that, as we have seen above, we need $\hat\lambda>0$ to have a positive definite Hessian (the condition $c_1>0$ in (\ref{c1c2}) is independent on the presence of non-perturbative effects), (\ref{Pu}) implies that $\partial\hat{V}/\partial{V}$ has to be positive, requiring $\hat\xi<0$ \cite{Ciupke:2015msa} contrary to our case where we need $\hat\xi>0$.

We finally mention that the $N_{\rm flat}=N_{\rm large}-1$ moduli fixed by $F^4$ effects turn out to be lighter than the volume mode since they acquire a mass of order:
\begin{equation}
m_{\tau_\alpha}^2\sim m_{V}^2 \left(\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_\KK}\right)^2 \ll m_{V}^2 \sim \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\qquad \alpha=1,\cdots, N_{\rm flat}\,,
\end{equation}
where the KK scale is of order $M_\KK \sim M_p {V}^{-2/3}$. Due to their shift symmetry, all the axionic partners of the moduli $\tau_\alpha$ are massless at this order of approximation and develop a tiny mass only via exponentially small non-perturbative corrections.


\subsection{String loops}
\label{Loops}

So far our analysis has included only non-perturbative corrections and $\alpha'^3$ effects at order $F^2$ and $F^4$. Other relevant perturbative contributions to the K\"ahler potential come from open string 1-loop corrections. Their form for arbitrary CY three-folds has been argued to lead to corrections to the K\"ahler potential of the form (in Einstein frame) \cite{Berg:2007wt}:
\begin{equation}
K_{g_s}^\KK=g_s \sum_i\frac{C_i \,t^\perp_i}{{V}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad K_{g_s}^\W=\sum_i \frac{D_i}{{V} \,t^\cap_i}\,,
\label{eq:Kstringloop}
\end{equation}
where the sum in $K_{g_s}^\KK$ is over all stacks of non-intersecting branes with $t^\perp_i= a_{ij} t_j$ begin the 2-cycle transverse to the branes, while the sum in $K_{g_s}^\W$ is over all stacks of intersecting branes with $t^\cap_i = b_{ij}t_j$ being the 2-cycle where the branes intersect. The first correction in (\ref{eq:Kstringloop}) is of order $\alpha'^2 g_s^2$ and comes from KK modes exchanged between D-branes, while the second type is of order $\alpha'^4 g_s^2$ and comes from winding modes associated with intersecting D-branes. $C_i$ and $D_i$ are unknown functions of the complex structure moduli which are set as constants solving the minimisation conditions at ${O}(1/{V}^2)$. The leading order winding 1-loop correction to the potential is \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W=-2 \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}K_{g_s}^\W\,.
\label{eq:Vstringloop}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the leading ${O}(\alpha'^2 g_s^2)$ correction coming from $K_{g_s}^\KK$ vanishes - a phenomenon dubbed `extended no-scale' in \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. The first non-vanishing KK contribution then turns out to be of order $\alpha'^4 g_s^4$ and can be obtained by expanding $K_{g_s}^\KK$ to second order in computing the potential and reads \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK=g_s^2 \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\sum_{ij} C_i C_j K_{ij}\,,
\label{eq:Vg}
\end{equation}
where $K_{ij}$ is the tree-level K\"ahler metric. Given that this contribution arises at ${O}(\alpha'^4 g_s^4)$ (in string frame and up to the overall prefactor $c=g_s/(8\pi)$), it is effectively of 2-loop order. Hence it can compete with 2-loop effects that contribute to linear order in $K_{g_s}^\KK$. These have been estimated to behave qualitatively as (\ref{eq:Vg}) \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} but a full control of the effective field theory would require more knowledge of these effects. 

Considering the isotropic limit where all the K\"ahler moduli are of the same size and using the fact that at leading order $4 K_{ij} = \frac{1}{{V}} \left(\frac{t_i t_j}{2 {V}}- A_{ij}^{-1} \right)$ \cite{Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp}, winding and KK loop corrections scale as:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W \sim g_s \,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^{10/3}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad V_{g_s}^\KK \sim g_s^3 \,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^{10/3}}\,.
\end{equation}
Thus in the regime where perturbation theory is under control, i.e. where $g_s\ll 1$, KK corrections are subdominant with respect to winding ones. Notice however that this need not be the case for anisotropic configurations since the exact moduli dependence of $V_{g_s}^\W$ and $V_{g_s}^\KK$ is different (see \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Cicoli:2011yy} for two examples). On the other hand, the higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ correction (\ref{PotF4}) behaves as:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4}\sim g_s^{1/2}\,\frac{W_0^4}{{V}^{11/3}}\sim g_s^{-1/2}\,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^{1/3}}\,V_{g_s}^\W \,,
\label{eq:V_1est}
\end{equation} 
and so in the isotropic limit, $\alpha'^3$ $F^4$ terms dominate over string loop corrections if:
\begin{equation}
{V} \ll g_s^{-3/2}\,W_0^6\,.
\label{bound}
\end{equation}
This condition sets an upper bound on the volume mode which is very sensitive to the values of the string coupling and the flux superpotential. Just as a reference example, if $g_s=0.1$ we obtain ${V}\ll 10^{13}$ for $W_0=90$, ${V}\ll 10^9$ for $W_0=20$, ${V}\ll 10^6$ for $W_0=6$ and ${V}\ll 10^3$ for $W_0=2$. If the underlying parameters satisfy the bound (\ref{bound}), loop corrections can be neglected and the analysis we performed in the previous section is under control. Notice moreover that 1-loop effects can also be absent by construction. In fact, there are no winding effects in the absence of intersections between different stacks of branes, or if the intersection locus does not contain non-contractible 1-cycles. In addition, KK loop corrections are not present in compactifications without D3-branes and O3-planes, and where all D7-branes and O7-planes intersect each other (or are on top of each other) \cite{Berg:2007wt}.

Let us finally stress that $g_s$ corrections in general depend on all K\"ahler moduli, and so, as pointed out in \cite{Cicoli:2008va}, they are also expected to lift all the remaining flat directions in LVS models where they dominate over $F^4$ terms since the microscopic parameters do not satisfy the bound (\ref{bound}). However the moduli dependence of string loop effects is difficult to analyse in general for an arbitrary CY manifold while the moduli dependence in (\ref{PotF4}) is extremely simple. This is the reason why we focused on cases where higher derivatives are the leading sources for the stabilisation of the LVS flat directions. 

\section{$\alpha'$ Inflation}
\label{Sec2}

Being a leading order flat direction, each of the $N_{\rm flat}=N_{\rm large}-1$ moduli is a very promising inflaton candidate since its mass is naturally lighter than the Hubble scale during inflation. The flatness of the inflaton potential is also protected by an approximate non-compact rescaling shift symmetry which is due to the no-scale property of type IIB models \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. This inflationary framework has produced two interesting models: Fibre Inflation where the inflationary potential is generated by winding and KK $g_s$ effects \cite{Cicoli:2008va}, and the model of \cite{Broy:2015zba}
where the inflationary dynamics is determined by $F^4$ terms and KK string loop corrections. This kind of models have been generalised in \cite{Burgess:2016owb} which pointed out that they are all characterised by the prediction $r= 2 (f/M_p)^2 (n_s-1)^2$, where horizon exit takes place in a plateau region and the exact value of the effective decay constant $f$ depends on the nature of the effects which develop the inflationary potential.  

In this paper we focused so far on the r\^ole that higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ terms can play in moduli stabilisation. However \cite{Broy:2015zba} has shown that $F^4$ terms alone cannot give rise to a viable inflationary model. We shall therefore include both higher derivative ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ contributions and ${O}(\alpha'^4 g_s^2)$ winding loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential,\footnote{Notice that tree-level bulk $\alpha'^4$ effects are expected to be absent \cite{Halverson:2013qca} due to the vanishing of the five-loop beta-function \cite{Grisaru:1986wj}.} and show that these two effects can support inflation with enough efoldings to solve the flatness and horizon problems and a the scalar spectral index which is compatible with present observational bounds. The largest predicted value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r\simeq 0.01$, turns out instead to be at the edge of detectability \cite{rForecasts}. 


\subsection{Inflationary potential}

Let us focus on LVS models with 2 large moduli, and so with $N_{\rm flat}=1$ flat direction which is lifted by the interplay of $F^4$ terms and winding loop corrections. Similarly to \cite{Cicoli:2008va}, we consider a simple K3 or $T^4$-fibred CY three-fold whose volume form looks like \cite{Cicoli:2011it}:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \lambda_1 t_1 t_2^2 + \lambda_s t_s^3\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tau_1= \lambda_1 t_2^2$ is the size of the K3 or $T^4$ fibre while $t_1 = \tau_2/\left(2 \sqrt{\lambda_1 \tau_1}\right)$ is the volume of the $\mathbb{P}^1$ base ($t_s<0$ is an exceptional divisor which supports non-perturbative effects). As we have seen in the previous section, KK loop contributions are effectively 2-loop effects because of the extended no-scale cancellation, and so they can be neglected with respect to 1-loop winding effects due to the suppression factor $g_s^2\ll 1$. The effective field theory is therefore more under control since we do not have to include poorly understood 2-loop KK contributions. Let us also point out that KK $g_s$ effects might also be absent by construction if there are no O3-planes and D3-branes and all O7-planes and D7-branes intersect (or are on top of) each other \cite{Berg:2007wt}. 

Given that $\alpha'$ corrections (both $F^4$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ terms and $F^2$ ${O}(\alpha'^4 g_s^2)$ winding loop effects) are crucial to generate the inflationary potential of our model, we name it `$\alpha'$-Inflation'. Setting without loss of generality $\lambda_1=1$ and using (\ref{eq:Vstringloop}), 1-loop winding corrections take the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s} = - \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{B W_0^2}{{V}^3\sqrt{\tau_1}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is a tunable flux-dependent coefficient. On the other hand, from (\ref{PotF4}) higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ effects behave as (for $\lambda= -|\lambda|$ and positive $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$):
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)^2 \frac{|\lambda| W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}{V}^4} \left(\Pi_1 \frac{{V}}{\tau_1} + \Pi_2\sqrt{\tau_1}\right).
\end{equation}
Notice that we traded $\tau_2$ for ${V}$ and we neglected $\tau_s$-dependent contributions since both the overall volume mode and the small blow-up mode $\tau_s$ are fixed at leading order by non-perturbative and $\alpha'^3$ $F^2$ corrections. The total inflationary potential therefore becomes:
\begin{equation}
V = V_{g_s} + V_{F^4} = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\left[\frac{C_1}{\tau_1}-\frac{B}{\sqrt{\tau_1}}+C_2\frac{\sqrt{\tau_1}}{{V}}\right],
\label{Vinf}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
C_1 = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{|\lambda| W_0^2 \Pi_1}{g_s^{3/2}}>0 \qquad\text{and}\qquad C_2=\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{|\lambda| W_0^2\Pi_2}{g_s^{3/2}}>0\,.
\end{equation}
Assuming that the third term in (\ref{Vinf}) is suppressed with respect to the first two (as we will show later), the minimum is at (for $B>0$):
\begin{equation}
\langle\tau_1\rangle = \frac{4 C_1^2}{B^2}\,.
\end{equation}
Let us now consider the canonically normalised inflaton $\phi$ and shift it from its minimum, $\phi=\langle\phi\rangle+\hat\phi$, obtaining \cite{Cicoli:2008va}:
\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = e^{\kappa\phi}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \tau_1 = \langle\tau_1\rangle\,e^{\kappa\hat\phi}\quad\text{for}\quad\kappa=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
Substituting this result in (\ref{Vinf}) we end up with:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{3 m_\phi^2}{2} \left(1-R +e^{-\kappa\hat\phi}- 2 \,e^{-\kappa\hat\phi/2} +R\,e^{\kappa\hat\phi/2}\right).
\label{Vinf2}
\end{equation}
Here we have added the uplifted LVS terms which need to be tuned (by adjusting background fluxes) to have a Minkowski vacuum after including string loop and $F^4$ terms. Also the inflaton mass at the minimum is given by:
\begin{equation}
m_\phi^2 = \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\frac{2 C_1}{3\langle\tau_1\rangle}\qquad\text{and}\qquad R \equiv \frac{8 C_2 C_1^2}{B^3 {V}}
=\frac{\Pi_2}{\Pi_1} \frac{\langle\tau_1\rangle^{3/2}}{{V}}\,.
\label{R}
\end{equation}
In order to have a viable inflationary model we need to require $R\ll 1$ since otherwise the positive exponential term would destroy the flatness of the inflaton potential. This implies that we need a hierarchy between the topological numbers $\Pi_2\ll \Pi_1$ together with $\langle\tau_1\rangle \ll {V}^{2/3}$. From (\ref{Vinf2}) we can clearly see that the Hubble scale during inflation $H^2=V/3$ is set by the inflaton mass at the minimum. Moving the inflaton away from the minimum, its mass becomes exponentially suppressed with respect to $H$ (for $R\ll 1$), and so the potential (\ref{Vinf2}) becomes flat enough to drive inflation.

\subsection{Cosmological observables}

Starting from the inflationary potential (\ref{Vinf2}), the slow-roll parameters become:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac12 \left(\frac{V'}{V}\right)^2 = \frac{\left(2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}-2 e^{-\frac{2\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}+R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}\right)^2}	{6 \left(1-R+e^{-\frac{2 \hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}-2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}+R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}\right)^2}\,,
\label{eps}
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\eta= \frac{V''}{V}=\frac{4 e^{-\frac{2 \hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}-2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}+R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}}{3\left(1-R+e^{-\frac{2 \hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}-2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}+R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}\right)}\,.
\label{eta}
\end{equation}
The slow-roll parameter $\eta$ vanishes at the two inflection points $\hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(1)}\simeq \sqrt{3}\ln 2\simeq 1.2$ where the two negative exponentials compete with each other, and $\hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(2)}=\frac12 \hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(1)} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\ln R\gg \hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(1)}$ for $R\ll 1$ where the positive exponential becomes comparable in size with $e^{-\kappa\hat\phi/2}$. The slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ at $\hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(1)}$ becomes $\epsilon_{\rm ip}^{(1)}\simeq 2/3$, signaling that inflation ends close to the first inflection point. In fact, $\epsilon\simeq 1$ around $\hat\phi_{\rm end}=1$, independently of the microscopic parameters since the term proportional to $R$ can be neglected in the vicinity of the minimum. As in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, there is an inflationary plateau to the right of the first inflection point and inflation takes place for field values in the window $\hat\phi_{\rm ip}^{(1)}<\hat\phi<\phi_{\rm ip}^{(2)}$ since the spectral index is always too blue for $\hat\phi>\phi_{\rm ip}^{(2)}$.

The number of efoldings between the point of horizon exit $\hat\phi_*$ and the end of inflation is then computed as:
\begin{equation}
N_e = \int_{1}^{\hat\phi_*} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon(\hat\phi)}}\,d\hat\phi\,.
\end{equation}
The amplitude of the density perturbations at horizon exit has to match the observed value, requiring:
\begin{equation}
A_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm COBE} = \left.\left(\frac{V^{3/2}}{V'}\right)^2\right|_{\hat\phi_*} = 2.7\cdot 10^{-7}\,.
\end{equation}
The main cosmological observables we are interested in are the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which have to be evaluated at horizon exit as:
\begin{equation}
n_s = 1 +2\eta_* -6\epsilon_*\qquad\text{and}\qquad r=16\epsilon_*\,.
\end{equation}
In the region close to horizon exit at large $\hat\phi$, the term in the potential proportional to $e^{-\kappa\hat\phi}$ is negligible with respect to the other contributions, and so the slow-roll parameters (\ref{eps}) and (\ref{eta}) simplify to:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \simeq\frac16 \left(2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}+R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}\right)^2
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\eta\simeq -\frac13 \left(2 e^{-\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}-R\,e^{\frac{\hat\phi}{\sqrt{3}}}\right)\,,
\label{epseta}
\end{equation}
giving the relation:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon\simeq \frac32\,\eta^2+\frac43\,R\,,
\end{equation}
which for $\eta\ll 1$ implies:
\begin{equation}
n_s\simeq 1+2\eta - 8R\qquad\text{and}\qquad  r\simeq 6\left(n_s-1\right)^2 + \frac{64}{3}\,R\,.
\end{equation}
For $R\to 0$ these predictions reproduce the ones of Fibre Inflation \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. However for $R = b \,\eta^2$, with $b\sim {O}(1)$, the prediction for $r$ changes substantially since we obtain:
\begin{equation}
n_s\simeq 1+2\eta \qquad\text{and}\qquad  r\simeq \left(6+\frac{16}{3}\,b\right)\left(n_s-1\right)^2\,.
\end{equation}
Given that the prediction for $n_s$ is not changed, values of $R$ close to $\eta^2$ can increase the prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio with respect to the one of Fibre Inflation without modifying the value of spectral index. We shall present below some choices of underlying parameters which reproduce this situation. However we first stress that in order to trust our single-field approximation, we need to require that the mass of volume mode is larger than the Hubble scale during inflation $H^2=V/3$. The volume mode mass scales as:
\begin{equation}
m_{V}^2 = \frac{d}{\ln\left({V}/W_0\right)}\,V_{\alpha'}\,,
\end{equation}
where $V_{\alpha'}$ is the leading order $\alpha'^3$ contribution in the LVS potential (\ref{VLVS}) and the exact value of the prefactor $d$ depends on the uplifting mechanism. Without uplifting $d=27/4$ \cite{Conlon:2007gk} whereas for dS vacua from hidden matter F-terms $d=3/4$ and for dS from non-perturbative effects at singularities $d=9/2$ \cite{Cicoli:2015bpq}. This corresponds to imposing at horizon exit:
\begin{equation}
{R} \equiv \left.\frac{H^2}{m_{V}^2}\right|_{\hat\phi} = \left.\frac{\ln\left({V}/W_0\right)}{3c}\frac{V}{V_{\alpha'}}\right|_{\hat\phi} \simeq \frac{m_\phi^2}{V_{\alpha'}} = \frac{8 C_1 g_s^{3/2}}{9\xi\langle\tau_1\rangle}\ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
Finally the $\alpha'$ expansion can be trusted if the $\xi$-dependent piece in the K\"ahler potential (\ref{4DEFT}) is subleading with respect to the tree-level term, and so if:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\xi\equiv \frac{\xi}{2g_s^{3/2}{V}}\ll 1\,. 
\end{equation}
Let us now present two illustrative choices of the underlying parameters which satisfy these requirements and lead to inflation with around $50$-$60$ efoldings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item This parameter choice is characterised by $\Pi_2=0$, implying $C_2=R=0$, and so it reproduces the same predictions as Fibre Inflation \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. The other parameters are ($\lambda$ is expected to be between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$):
\begin{equation}
g_s=0.1\quad W_0=10\quad \xi=1\quad B=5.248 \quad \Pi_1 = 100\quad \lambda=0.01\quad {V}=10^3\,,
\end{equation}
giving $C_1=12.58$ and:
\begin{equation}
\langle\tau_1\rangle = 23\quad \langle\tau_2\rangle=417\quad N_e=56.5\quad\hat\phi_*=6.5\quad n_s=0.966 \quad r=0.006\,,
\end{equation}
together with:
\begin{equation}
{R} = 0.015\qquad\text{and}\qquad \epsilon_\xi = 0.016\,.
\end{equation}

\item We now consider the case with $R\neq 0$, finding a prediction which is qualitatively different from the one of Fibre Inflation. We choose:
\begin{equation}
g_s=0.1\quad W_0=10\quad \xi=1\quad B=3.4 \quad \Pi_1 = 26 \quad \Pi_2=1\quad \lambda=0.01 \quad {V}=10^3\,,
\end{equation}
giving $C_1=3.27$, $C_2=0.13$, $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$ and:
\begin{equation}
\langle\tau_1\rangle = 3.7 \quad \langle\tau_2\rangle=1039\quad N_e=50\quad\hat\phi_*=6.425\quad n_s=0.972 \quad r=0.01\,,
\end{equation}
together with:
\begin{equation}
{R} = 0.025\qquad\text{and}\qquad \epsilon_\xi = 0.016\,.
\end{equation}
Notice that larger values of $\langle\tau_1\rangle$ require larger values of $\Pi_1$ since for $\Pi_1=100$ we would have the same results as above apart from $W_0=8.94$ and $B=6.67$ which imply $C_1=10$, $C_2=0.1$, $\langle\tau_1\rangle=9.1$, $\langle\tau_2\rangle=662.4$ and ${R}=0.046$. Notice finally that larger values of $R$ would give a spectral index which is too blue (for example for $R= 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ we would have $N_e=50$ at $\hat\phi_*=6.53$ where $n_s=0.98$ and $r=0.012$) whereas smaller values of $R$ would correspond to more unnatural choices of the underlying parameters. In fact, since $\Pi_2\geq 1$ we realise from (\ref{R}) that a smaller value of $R$ can be obtained either for larger, and so more tuned, values of $\Pi_1$, or for larger values of the volume ${V}$. We do not consider smaller values of $\langle\tau_1\rangle$ since we want to remain in the regime of trustability of the effective field theory. However in order to reduce $R$ by $1$ order of magnitude to get back to the prediction of the previous case, i.e. $r\simeq 0.006$, the volume has also to be increased by $1$ order of magnitude. At fixed $\lambda$, this implies that both $W_0$ and $B$ have to be increased as $W_0\to 5.62 W_0$ and $B\to 31.62 B$ in order to keep fixed both $V_0$ to match the COBE normalisation and $\langle\tau_1\rangle$ in order not to obtain too small values. However $B$ turns out to be more tuned since the previous value $B=6.67$ would shift to $B=211$. If $\lambda$ is decreased to $\lambda=0.001$, we need $W_0\to 10 W_0$ and $B\to 10 B$ which would still give larger values of $B$.
\end{enumerate}
The form of the inflationary potential for different values of the small parameter $R$ is plotted in Fig. \ref{Fig1}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, angle=0]{Figure1.eps}
\caption{Plot of the inflationary potential for $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$ (red line), $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-5}$ (green line) and $R=0$ (blue line).} 
\label{Fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Due to the large value of $r$, the inflationary scale is very high: 
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm inf}^4 = V(\hat\phi) = \frac{r}{0.12} \left(\,1.94\cdot 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4 \simeq \left(1.04\cdot 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4\qquad\text{for}\quad r\simeq 0.01\,.
\label{Minf}
\end{equation}
In order to trust our effective field theory we need to impose that $M_{\rm inf}$ is below the KK scale $M_\KK$. The string scale in terms of the 4D Planck scale is:
\begin{equation}
M_s = 2\pi \ell_s^{-1} = \frac{g_s^{1/4}\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{{V}}}\,M_p\,.
\end{equation}
Hence the KK scale is given by (using that the volume in string frame $\vo_s$ is related to the volume in Einstein frame as $\vo_s = g_s^{-3/2} {V}$):
\begin{equation}
M_\KK = \frac{M_s}{\vo_s^{1/6}} = \sqrt{\pi}\,\frac{M_p}{{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{equation}
and so $M_\KK^4\ll M_s^4$ if $\vo_s\gg 1$ or ${V}\gg g_s^{-3/2}$, and from (\ref{Minf}) (without fixing $r$) we have $M_{\rm inf}^4\ll M_\KK^4$ if ${V}\ll 1390\,r^{-3/8}$. Combining these two bounds we find that:
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm inf}^4\ll M_\KK^4 \ll M_s^4\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad g_s^{-3/2}\ll {V}\ll 1390\,r^{-3/8}\,.
\end{equation}
For $g_s=0.1$ we find ${V}\gg 30$. If we then set ${V}\simeq 10^3$ we find $r\ll 2.4$, showing that our prediction $r\simeq 0.01$ is still in the regime where we can trust the effective field theory. However, for ${V}\simeq 10^4$ we find $r\ll 0.005$ which is incompatible with our previous prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The KK scale in the example above with $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$ turns out to be $M_\KK\simeq 4.35\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV, and so $\left(M_{\rm inf}/M_\KK\right)^4\simeq 0.003$. Moreover also the energy density which stabilises the volume mode is below the KK scale since $V_{\alpha'}\left( M_p/M_\KK\right)^4\simeq 0.095$. From this analysis, it follows that $r\simeq 0.01$ is probably the largest possible value of $r$ that allows a marginal control over the effective field theory. 



\subsection{Comparison with Fibre Inflation}

Let us finally compare our model with Fibre Inflation whose potential has a similar behaviour to the one of (\ref{Vinf2}) since it reads \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}:
\begin{equation}
V_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm FI} = V_0 \left(1 +\frac13 e^{-2\kappa\hat\phi}- \frac43 \,e^{-\kappa\hat\phi/2} +R\,e^{\kappa\hat\phi}\right)
\quad\text{with}\quad R\ll 1\,.
\label{VinfFI}
\end{equation}
Clearly both potentials feature a plateau followed by a steepening region. However, given that in Fibre Inflation the positive exponential has a larger coefficient, the potential of $\alpha'$ Inflation has a longer plateau for the same value of $R$. The comparison between the two different potentials for $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$ is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig2}. The vertical line corresponds to horizon exit at $\hat\phi_*=6.425$ that gives $N_e\simeq 50$ for $\alpha'$ Inflation. At this point in field space the slow-roll conditions in Fibre Inflation are violated. In fact, its potential is too steep to support enough efoldings of inflation. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, angle=0]{Figure2.eps}
\caption{Comparison between Fibre Inflation (blue line) and $\alpha'$ Inflation (red line) for $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$. The vertical line indicates the point of horizon exit for $\alpha'$ Inflation. The potential for Fibre Inflation is too steep to support enough efoldings of inflation.} 
\label{Fig2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

If $R$ is reduced by one order of magnitude, the two potentials give in practice the same prediction, as can be seen from Fig. \ref{Fig3}. Notice that in $\alpha'$ Inflation it is more natural to have horizon exit close to the steepening region where the predictions for the two main cosmological observables are $n_s\simeq 0.97$ and $r\simeq 0.01$. In fact, in the case with $R=2.74\cdot 10^{-4}$ horizon exit at $\hat\phi_* =6.425$ is close to the inflection point at $\hat\phi_{\rm ip}=7.68$ where the negative exponential becomes comparable to the positive one. On the other hand in Fibre Inflation the steepening is stronger, and so horizon exit has to take place deep inside the plateau region otherwise the spectral index would become too blue.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

In this paper we have shown explicitly the existence of generalised LVS vacua for arbitrary CY manifolds with at least one local blow-up mode. The new key-ingredient is the inclusion of higher dimensional $\alpha'^3$ corrections recently computed in \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. At leading order in an expansion in inverse powers of the internal volume ${V}$, $\alpha'^3$ $F^2$ effects compete with non-perturbative corrections to $W$ to fix ${V}$ and all $N_{\rm small}$ small blow-up mode. Each of the $N_{\rm flat} = h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small}-1$ remaining flat directions can be shown to be lifted in general by $\alpha'^3$ $F^4$ terms if these have the correct sign. 

When the superspace derivative expansion is under control, i.e. when $F^4$ effects are subdominant with respect to $F^2$ terms which is equivalent to require $m_{3/2}\ll M_\KK$ \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}, these flat directions are lifted at subleading order, and so the corresponding moduli are naturally lighter than all the other modes. This crucial feature makes all of them promising inflaton candidates. 

Hence in the second part of this paper we focused on cosmological applications for cases where $N_{\rm flat}=1$. We developed a new inflationary model, which we named `$\alpha'$ Inflation', where ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ $F^4$ terms compete with ${O}(\alpha'^4 g_s^2)$ $F^2$ loop corrections coming from the exchange of winding modes between intersecting stacks of branes. The inflationary potential is characterised by an exponentially flat plateau followed by a steepening region. The flatness of the inflationary potential is protected against dangerous higher dimensional operators by a non-compact shift symmetry inherited from the no-scale structure which is broken only beyond tree-level \cite{Burgess:2014tja,Burgess:2016owb}. 

For natural values of the underlying parameters horizon exit for $N_e\sim 50 - 60$ occurs in a region where the steepening effect is not negligible, and so the model predicts a large tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\simeq 0.01$ together with a spectral index $n_s\simeq 0.97$ in agreement with present data. Future cosmological observations will soon test the predictions of our model \cite{rForecasts}. The inflationary scale is of order $M_{\rm inf}\simeq 1.04\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV while the KK scale is slightly higher, $M_\KK\simeq 4.35\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV, showing that the effective field theory is marginally under control since $\left(M_{\rm inf}/M_\KK\right)^4\simeq 0.003$ and the ratio between the mass of the volume mode and the Hubble scale is $(H/m_{V})^2\simeq 0.025$. This shows also that $r\simeq 0.01$ is probably the largest possible prediction for $r$ which is compatible with a trustable effective field theory. 
Due to the high scale of the moduli potential, the gravitino mass also turns out to be very high, $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, leading to soft terms much higher than the TeV scale. Sequestering supersymmetry breaking from the visible sector \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa} might help to suppress the soft terms from the gravitino mass but these would still be very far from low energy.

Comparing our model with Fibre Inflation \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, the potential of $\alpha'$ Inflation has a very similar shape but with a milder raising behaviour at large field values. Hence horizon exit can take place close to the steepening region, enhancing the tensor-to-scalar ratio without obtaining a spectral index which is too blue. 

An interesting future line of work involves the construction of global models of $\alpha'$ Inflation in concrete CY manifolds with explicit brane set-up and choice of fluxes. Moreover it would be interesting to investigate how reheating takes place after the end of inflation along the lines of \cite{Cicoli:2015bpq, Reheat}.

\section{\label{app:gaugefields}Homogeneous gauge fields}

Throughout this appendix, we investigate the properties of general $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge fields $A=A_{\mu}^{a}(\tau,\vec{x})$ which are not subject to any particular equation of motion. We make use of the following notation: 
\[
A^{a}=(A_{0}^{a},\vec{A}^{a}),\ \implies\ A=(A_{0},\vec{A}).
\]
 Thus $\vec{A}=\vec{A}_{i}^{a}$ denotes a $3\times3$ matrix, while $A=A_{\mu}^{a}$ denotes a $3\times4$ matrix.

In \prettyref{app:homo-gauge} we introduce definitions of homogeneity and isotropy for a gauge field. Then we prove that when $A$ is homogeneous, there is a gauge where $A_{0}=0$ and $\vec{A}(\tau,\vec{x})=\vec{A}(\tau)$. In \prettyref{app:iso-gauge} we prove that if $A$ is moreover isotropic, then there is a gauge in which the standard\footnote{This ansatz dates back at least to 1989 (see \cite{Verbin:1989sg}). A convincing justification of this ansatz appears in Section 5.1 of \cite{Maleknejad:2012fw}. Our mathematically rigorous proof extends this work, in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, by accounting for additional edge cases and explicitly constructing the necessary gauge transformations. } ansatz $A_{i}^{a}(\tau)=f(\tau)\,\delta_{i}^{a}$ holds. We describe in \prettyref{app:global-symmetries} the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ subgroup which fixes a homogeneous and isotropic gauge-field background, and how this is useful for the decomposition of perturbations. In \prettyref{app:quant-aniso}, we introduce some observables for any homogeneous gauge field, and we prove that they are gauge-invariant (with a very minor caveat). We use these observables to quantify isotropy and anisotropy. These observables are also used in \prettyref{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields} to plot the time-evolution of a non-isotropic background gauge field. Finally in \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof}, we use these observables to complete the proof of \prettyref{thm:isotropy} from \prettyref{app:iso-gauge}. 

\subsection{\label{app:homo-gauge}Homogeneous and temporal gauge }

In this subsection, we define homogeneity for gauge fields, and we construct a gauge suitable for studying such fields.

A gauge field is homogeneous when every translation is equivalent to a gauge transformation, i.e.
\begin{defn}
\label{def:homogeneous}A gauge field $A$ is \emph{homogeneous} if for every spatial translation by $\Delta\vec{x}$, there exists a gauge transformation $g_{\Delta\vec{x}}(\tau,\vec{x})$ such that 
\begin{equation}
A(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x})=g_{\Delta\vec{x}}(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x}),\label{eq:homogeneous-definition}
\end{equation}
where $\cdot$ denotes a gauge transformation: 
\begin{equation}
g(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A_{\mu}(\tau,\vec{x})\equiv g(\tau,\vec{x})A_{\mu}(\tau,\vec{x})g(\tau,\vec{x})^{-1}+(i/e)\left(\partial_{\mu}g(\tau,\vec{x})\right)g(\tau,\vec{x})^{-1}.\label{eq:gauge-formula}
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

Obvious examples of gauge fields which are homogeneous are those which satisfy the following condition.
\begin{defn}
\label{def:homogeneous-gauge}A gauge field $A(\tau,\vec{x})$ is said to be in \emph{homogeneous gauge} if $A(\tau,\vec{x})=A(\tau)$, i.e. $A(\tau,\vec{x})$ does not depend on $\vec{x}$.
\end{defn}

The following lemma is unsurprising yet not completely obvious:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:homogeneous}If $A(\tau,\vec{x})$ is homogeneous in the sense of \prettyref{def:homogeneous}, then there exists some gauge transformation which puts it into homogeneous gauge.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The strategy will be to use the definition of homogeneity to construct a gauge transformation $h(\tau,\vec{x})$ such that the gauge-transformed field $h(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x})$ is spatially constant. Equivalently, $h(\tau,\vec{x})$ should satisfy 
\begin{equation}
h(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x})=h(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x})\label{eq:const-gf}
\end{equation}
 for all $\Delta\vec{x}$. 

By comparing a single translation by $\Delta\vec{x}_{1}+\Delta\vec{x}_{2}$ with two translations $\Delta\vec{x}_{1}$ followed by $\Delta\vec{x}_{2}$, we have 
\begin{align*}
g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{1}+\Delta\vec{x}_{2}}(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x}) & =A(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}_{1}+\Delta\vec{x}_{2})\\
 & =g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{2}}(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}_{1})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}_{1})\\
 & =g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{2}}(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}_{1})\,g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{1}}(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x}).
\end{align*}
 It follows that\footnote{Technically, we are assuming here that a gauge transformation is determined by its action on $A$. It is however possible that there exist global symmetries which fix $A$. In this case, the gauge transformation is determined only up to this subgroup. This issue is easily remedied by declaring that all equalities of gauge transformations are understood modulo this subgroup of symmetries. Then no further modifications to the proof are necessary.} 
\[
g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{1}+\Delta\vec{x}_{2}}(\tau,\vec{x})=g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{2}}(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}_{1})\,g_{\Delta\vec{x}_{1}}(\tau,\vec{x}).
\]
 By making appropriate substitutions for $\Delta\vec{x}_{1}$, $\Delta\vec{x}_{2}$ and $\vec{x}$ in this identity, immediate consequences are 
\begin{align}
g_{0}(\vec{x}) & =\mathrm{Id},\nonumber \\
g_{\Delta\vec{x}}(\vec{x})^{-1} & =g_{-\Delta\vec{x}}(\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x}),\nonumber \\
g_{\Delta\vec{x}}(\vec{x}) & =g_{\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{0}+\Delta\vec{x}}(\vec{x}_{0})\,g_{\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{0}}(\vec{x}_{0})^{-1},\label{eq:gauge-id3}
\end{align}
 for all values of $\vec{x}$, $\Delta\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}_{0}$. 

Now fix a basepoint $\vec{x}_{0}$ and define $h(\tau,\vec{x})\equiv g_{\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{0}}(\tau,\vec{x}_{0})^{-1}$. It follows from \prettyref{eq:gauge-id3} that 
\[
g_{\Delta\vec{x}}(\tau,\vec{x})=h(\tau,\vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x})^{-1}h(\tau,\vec{x})
\]
 for all values of $\vec{x}$ and $\Delta\vec{x}$. Substituting this identity into \prettyref{eq:homogeneous-definition} we obtain \prettyref{eq:const-gf} as desired.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:hom-temp-gauge}If $A(\tau,\vec{x})$ is a homogeneous gauge field in the sense of \prettyref{def:homogeneous}, then it may be gauge-transformed simultaneously into homogeneous gauge and temporal gauge, so that $A_{0}(\tau,\vec{x})=0$ and $\vec{A}(\tau,\vec{x})=\vec{A}(\tau)$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By \prettyref{lem:homogeneous} we may assume that $A$ is in homogeneous gauge. To put $A(\tau)$ into temporal gauge, one solves for the gauge transformation $g(\tau)$ in 
\[
\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}g(\tau)=-ieg(\tau)A_{0}(\tau).
\]
 Since $g(\tau)$ does not depend on $\vec{x}$, it preserves homogeneous gauge.
\end{proof}
We warn that sometimes homogeneous and temporal gauge is incomplete as gauge fixing: we shall see that local gauge freedom remains in the case of \prettyref{exa:local-gt}. 

\subsection{\label{app:iso-gauge}Homogeneous and isotropic \texorpdfstring{$\mathrm{SU}(2)$}{SU(2)} gauge fields}

Suppose that $A_{\mu}^{a}(\tau,\vec{x})$ is a homogeneous gauge field, as described in the previous subsection. If every rotation is equivalent to a gauge transformation, then we say that $A$ is isotropic:
\begin{defn}
\label{def:isotropic-gf}A homogeneous gauge field $A(\tau,\vec{x})$ is \emph{isotropic} if for every $R\in\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}\subset\mathrm{SO}(4)$ there exists a gauge transformation $g_{R}(\tau,\vec{x})$ such that 
\begin{equation}
A_{\nu}^{a}(\tau,\vec{x})\,R_{\mu}^{\nu}=\left(g_{R}(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A(\tau,\vec{x})\right)_{\mu}^{a},\label{eq:iso-gt}
\end{equation}
 where again $\cdot$ denotes a gauge transformation as in \eqref{eq:gauge-formula}. 
\end{defn}

For the remainder of \prettyref{app:iso-gauge} we assume $A$ to be isotropic, and moreover given by $\vec{A}(\tau)$ in the homogeneous and temporal gauge of \prettyref{thm:hom-temp-gauge}. Our goal is to prove the following theorem. 
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:isotropy}Let $A_{\mu}^{a}(\tau,\vec{x})$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field (which is real-analytic\footnote{This technical condition is used to rule out the non-physical pathology described in \prettyref{exa:no-ansatz}. It is satisfied by the solutions of any well-behaved system of ODEs and constraint equations, and thus it applies to all solutions considered in this paper. }). Then up to a gauge transformation, $A$ is of the form 
\begin{equation}
A_{0}^{a}(\tau)=0,\quad A_{i}^{a}(\tau)=f(\tau)\,\delta_{i}^{a}\label{eq:iso-diag}
\end{equation}
 for some real-valued function $f(\tau)$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By \prettyref{thm:hom-temp-gauge} we may assume that $A$ is in homogeneous and temporal gauge. In \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} we introduce an $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-version of singular value decomposition (SVD) to be used with the $3\times3$ matrix $\vec{A}(\tau)=A_{i}^{a}(\tau)$. \prettyref{def:isotropic-matrix} introduces a notion of isotropy for $3\times3$ matrices, and \prettyref{lem:matrix-isotropy} characterizes such matrices. In \prettyref{exa:local-gt} we observe that despite $A$ being an isotropic gauge field, the matrix $\vec{A}(\tau)$ can be rank-one instead of isotropic. Later in \prettyref{app:quant-aniso} we develop the tools needed to deal with this subtlety, and in \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof} we prove \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact}, that the rank-one case may be eliminated by a gauge transformation, and we may therefore assume that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is always an isotropic matrix. \prettyref{lem:non-analytic} proves that $\vec{A}(\tau)=f(\tau)S$ for some $S\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$ along any interval where $f(\tau)\neq0$, but \prettyref{exa:no-ansatz} shows that different intervals may require different $S$. \prettyref{thm:analytic} proves that when $A$ is real-analytic, a single matrix $S$ suffices for all $\tau$. Finally, a global gauge transformation whose adjoint is $S^{-1}$ brings $A$ into the desired form.  
\end{proof}
To prove the supporting lemmas, we first introduce an $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-version of SVD.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:SVD-SOn}Let $M$ be any real $n\times n$ matrix with $n$ odd. Then there exist real $n\times n$ matrices $G$, $\Sigma$, and $R$ such that $G,R\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$, $\Sigma$ is diagonal, and $M=G\Sigma R^{T}$. This decomposition is not unique. The diagonal entries $(\sigma_{1},\ldots,\sigma_{n})$ of $\Sigma$ are called the \emph{singular values} of $M$. The singular values can be chosen to be non-negative (resp. negative) when $\det M$ is non-negative (resp. negative). Moreover, they can be chosen to satisfy $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|\geq\cdots\geq\left|\sigma_{n}\right|$. When subject to these two constraints, the singular values are uniquely determined. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The standard SVD for real $n\times n$ matrices produces matrices $G_{0}$, $\Sigma_{0}$, and $R_{0}$ with $G_{0},R_{0}\in\mathrm{O}(n)$ and $\Sigma_{0}$ diagonal. Moreover, we may choose the diagonal entries $\sigma_{1}^{0},\ldots,\sigma_{n}^{0}$ of $\Sigma_{0}$ to satisfy $\sigma_{1}^{0}\geq\cdots\geq\sigma_{n}^{0}\geq0$ in which case the singular values are uniquely determined. Upon setting 
\[
G=\begin{cases}
+G_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det G_{0}=1,\\
-G_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det G_{0}=-1,
\end{cases}\quad R=\begin{cases}
+R_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det R_{0}=1,\\
-R_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det R_{0}=-1,
\end{cases}\quad\Sigma=\begin{cases}
+\Sigma_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det M\geq0,\\
-\Sigma_{0} & \textrm{ if }\det M\leq0,
\end{cases}
\]
 the hypotheses of \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} are satisfied. 
\end{proof}
In analogy with \prettyref{def:isotropic-gf} of an isotropic gauge field, we make a similar definition for matrices:
\begin{defn}
\label{def:isotropic-matrix}A $3\times3$ matrix $M$ is said to be \emph{isotropic} if for each $R\in\mathrm{SO}(3)$ there exists some $G_{R}\in\mathrm{SO}(3)$ such that $MR=G_{R}M$.
\end{defn}

In the case $M=\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$, the matrix $M$ is isotropic if and only if every spatial rotation is equivalent to a \emph{global} gauge transformation for the restriction of $\vec{A}(\tau)$ to the time-slice $\tau_{0}$. 

We have the following characterization of isotropic matrices:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:matrix-isotropy}A $3\times3$ matrix $M$ is isotropic if and only if $M$ is a scalar multiple of an orthogonal matrix, or equivalently if the singular values of $M$ satisfy $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We will demonstrate the following logical implications:
\begin{align*}
\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right| & \implies M\textrm{ is a scalar multiple of an orthogonal matrix}\\
 & \implies M\textrm{ is isotropic}\\
 & \implies\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|.
\end{align*}
 Since these three conditions will form a loop of implications, they are logically equivalent. 

If $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|$, then it is easy to express $\Sigma$ from \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} as $\lambda\equiv\sqrt[3]{\det M}$ times some diagonal matrix in $\mathrm{SO}(n)$. In this case, \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} expresses $M$ as $\lambda$ times a product of three elements of $\mathrm{SO}(n)$, establishing the first implication. 

For the next implication, suppose that $M=\lambda S$ for $S\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$. Then for any $R\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$, we verify that $MR=\lambda SR=SRS^{T}(\lambda S)$, so that $M$ is isotropic by \prettyref{def:isotropic-matrix} with $G_{R}=SRS^{T}$. 

For the final implication, suppose that $M$ is isotropic, and that $M=G_{1}\Sigma_{1}R_{1}^{T}$ is an SVD in the sense of \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn}. By taking $R=R_{1}$ in the definition of isotropy, we conclude that $G_{R_{1}}M=MR_{1}=G_{1}\Sigma_{1}$. Since left-multiplication by orthogonal matrices (here $G_{R_{1}}$ and $G_{1}$) preserves the norms of matrix columns, we conclude that the columns of $M$ have norms $\left(\left|\sigma_{1}\right|,\left|\sigma_{2}\right|,\left|\sigma_{3}\right|\right)$. Next we consider the result of taking $R=R_{1}C$ where 
\begin{gather*}
C=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right).
\end{gather*}
 We similarly conclude that the columns of $M$ have norms $\left(\left|\sigma_{2}\right|,\left|\sigma_{3}\right|,\left|\sigma_{1}\right|\right)$. Therefore $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|$. 
\end{proof}
We note that if the uniqueness constraints of \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} are imposed, then $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|$ implies that $\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}=\sigma_{3}$. Thus if $M$ is isotropic, then it is possible to find an SVD of the type in \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn} where $\Sigma$ is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.

At this stage, it is tempting to mistakenly claim that since $A(\tau)$ is an isotropic gauge field in the sense of \prettyref{def:isotropic-gf}, it follows that for each $\tau_{0}$ the matrix $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ must be isotropic in the sense of \prettyref{def:isotropic-matrix}. However, the following example demonstrates that an isotropic gauge field can indeed have a non-isotropic matrix.
\begin{example}
\label{exa:local-gt}For any real number $\sigma_{1}$, consider the gauge transformation $\exp\left(-ie\sigma_{1}\mathbf{T}_{1}x^{1}\right)$ applied to the zero gauge field $A_{\mu}^{a}=0$. The transformed gauge field has $A_{1}^{1}=\sigma_{1}$ with all other components zero. Thus a nonzero constant gauge field with singular values $(\sigma_{1},0,0)$ is gauge-equivalent to the zero gauge field.
\end{example}

The following definition is useful for characterizing \prettyref{exa:local-gt} in a coordinate-independent manner:
\begin{defn}
\label{def:rank-one}A $3\times3$ matrix $M$ is said to be \emph{rank-one} if exactly one of the singular values of $M$ is non-zero.
\end{defn}

Thus \prettyref{exa:local-gt} shows that if $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is any rank-one matrix which is constant in $\tau$, then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is gauge-equivalent to zero. In \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof} we show that this is the only example in which a non-isotropic matrix can arise from an isotropic gauge field. Since the zero matrix is isotropic, we may assume, up to gauge, that the matrix $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is always isotropic (see \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact}).

In order to analyze $\vec{A}(\tau)$, it is useful to work with the electric field matrix 
\[
E_{i}^{b}(\tau,\vec{x})\equiv-a(\tau)^{-2}F_{0i}^{b}(\tau,\vec{x}).
\]
For convenience, we introduce the comoving quantity 
\begin{align*}
\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau,\vec{x}) & \equiv-a(\tau)^{2}\vec{E}(\tau,\vec{x})=F_{0i}^{b}(\tau,\vec{x}).
\end{align*}
 When $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is in homogeneous and temporal gauge, it follows that 
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)=\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\vec{A}(\tau).\label{eq:E-is-derivative}
\end{equation}
 Moreover, $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ is always an isotropic matrix when $A$ is homogeneous and isotropic:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:elec-is-iso}If $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge, then the electric field matrix $\vec{E}(\tau_{0})$ and the corresponding comoving quantity $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})$ are isotropic matrices for all $\tau_{0}$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
First note that $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau,\vec{x})$ satisfies the tensorial transformation property $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau,\vec{x})\mapsto G(\tau,\vec{x})\,\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau,\vec{x})$ under a gauge transformation $A\mapsto g(\tau,\vec{x})\cdot A$, where $G(\tau,\vec{x})$ denotes the adjoint $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ matrix corresponding to $g(\tau,\vec{x})$. Next we observe that $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})$ is an isotropic matrix for each $\tau_{0}$, which follows from the isotropy of $A$ as follows. For any $R\in\mathrm{SO}(3)$ we have 
\begin{equation}
g_{R}(\tau_{0},\vec{x})\cdot\vec{A}(\tau_{0})=\vec{A}(\tau_{0})\,R^{T},\label{eq:isotropy-A_sp}
\end{equation}
 and consequently 
\[
G_{R}(\tau_{0},\vec{x})\,\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})=\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})\,R^{T}
\]
 for each $\vec{x}$. Choosing an arbitrary point $\vec{x}_{0}$, it follows that $G_{R}(\tau_{0},\vec{x}_{0})$ provides the necessary group element for matrix isotropy (\prettyref{def:isotropic-matrix}) to be satisfied. Since $\vec{E}(\tau_{0})$ and $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})$ are proportional, the same $G_{R}(\tau_{0},\vec{x}_{0})$ applies also to $\vec{E}(\tau)$. 

We note that this proof uses \prettyref{def:isotropic-gf} of an isotropic gauge field without assuming that $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is an isotropic matrix. Thus this lemma will be useful in \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof} for understanding the rank one case. The same argument straightforwardly extends to prove that the magnetic field is isotropic.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:non-analytic}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge such that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is isotropic. For any interval along which $\vec{A}(\tau)\neq0$, there exists some $S\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$ such that 
\[
\vec{A}(\tau)=f(\tau)S.
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
From the characterization of \prettyref{lem:matrix-isotropy}, we know that $\vec{A}(\tau)=f(\tau)S(\tau)$, where $f(\tau)$ is nowhere zero along the interval in question. We wish to show that $S(\tau)$ is constant. Since $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ is an isotropic matrix and $S(\tau)\in\mathrm{SO}(3)$, we know from \prettyref{lem:matrix-isotropy} that $S(\tau)^{-1}\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ is also an isotropic matrix, and 
\[
S(\tau)^{-1}\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)=S(\tau)^{-1}\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\vec{A}(\tau)=f'(\tau)\,I+f(\tau)\,S^{-1}(\tau)\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}S(\tau).
\]
 In particular, this must be a scalar multiple of an orthogonal matrix for each $\tau$. Recall that the eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix all have absolute-value one. Thus the eigenvalues of $S(\tau)^{-1}\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ must all have the same absolute value. The matrix $S^{-1}(\tau)\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}S(\tau)$ is antisymmetric, and thus its components can be written as $\xi^{b}(\tau)\varepsilon_{aib}$ for some $\xi^{b}(\tau)$. The three eigenvalues of $S(\tau)^{-1}\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ are 
\[
\left\{ f'(\tau),f'(\tau)\pm if(\tau)\sqrt{\xi^{b}(\tau)\xi^{b}(\tau)}\right\} .
\]
 For these to have the same absolute value, it must be that $\xi^{b}(\tau)=0$ since by assumption $f(\tau)\neq0$. Thus $S^{-1}(\tau)\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}S(\tau)=0$ and hence $S(\tau)$ is constant.
\end{proof}
The following example shows that without some additional hypothesis, $S$ need not be constant where $f(\tau)=0$.
\begin{example}
\label{exa:no-ansatz}For any fixed time $\tau_{0}$, any $f(\tau)$ satisfying $f(\tau_{0})=0$, and any distinct $S_{+},S_{-}\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$, consider 
\[
A_{0}(\tau)=0,\quad\vec{A}(\tau)=\begin{cases}
f(\tau)S_{+} & \textrm{if }\tau\geq\tau_{0},\\
f(\tau)S_{-} & \textrm{if }\tau\leq\tau_{0}.
\end{cases}
\]
 This gauge field is homogeneous, isotropic, and not gauge-equivalent to the ansatz of \prettyref{thm:isotropy}. 
\end{example}

Such examples are not expected to occur in practice. If $\vec{A}(\tau)$ solves some well-behaved system of ODEs and constraint equations, then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is real-analytic, meaning that it has a locally-convergent power-series expansion. The following theorem sharpens \prettyref{lem:non-analytic} by excluding cases such as \prettyref{exa:no-ansatz}.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:analytic}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a real-analytic, homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge such that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is isotropic. There exists some $S\in\mathrm{SO}(n)$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}(\tau)=f(\tau)S\ \textrm{ for all }\tau.\label{eq:const-son}
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
According to the principle of unique continuation for real-analytic functions, if a real-analytic function $g(\tau)$ vanishes along any interval of positive width, then $g(\tau)$ is identically zero for all $\tau$. For any interval along which $f(\tau)\neq0$, \prettyref{lem:non-analytic} implies that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is confined to a one-dimensional subspace of $3\times3$ matrices. Thus there are eight complementary linear combinations of components of $\vec{A}(\tau)$ which vanish along the interval. By the principle of unique continuation, these components vanish for all $\tau$, and thus \prettyref{eq:const-son} holds for all $\tau$. 
\end{proof}
Up to the proof of \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact} given in \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof}, these results complete the proof of \prettyref{thm:isotropy}.

\subsection{\label{app:global-symmetries}Global symmetries of homogeneous and isotropic \texorpdfstring{$\mathrm{SU}(2)$}{SU(2)} gauge fields}

Understanding the global symmetries of a given field is important for perturbation theory. Namely, if some field is fixed by a global symmetry group, then linear perturbations around that field decompose into irreducible representations of that group. For example, suppose that $A(\tau)$ is any homogeneous $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field. Then $A(\tau)$ transforms under a pair of global $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries denoted by $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}$ and $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$. The group of spatial rotations is $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$, while $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}$ is the adjoint group of global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge transformations. If $(G,R)\in\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}\times\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$, then the transformation is given by 
\begin{align}
A^{a}{}_{i}(\tau) & \mapsto G^{a}{}_{b}A^{b}{}_{j}(\tau)\left(R^{T}\right)^{j}{}_{i}\quad\left(\vec{A}(\tau)\mapsto G\vec{A}(\tau)R^{T}\right),\label{eq:diagonal-action-space}\\
A^{a}{}_{0}(\tau) & \mapsto G^{a}{}_{b}A^{b}{}_{0}(\tau)\quad\left(A_{0}(\tau)\mapsto GA_{0}(\tau)\right).\label{eq:diagonal-action-time}
\end{align}
Suppose now that $A(\tau)$ is isotropic (and not gauge-equivalent to zero). By \prettyref{thm:isotropy} we can take $A(\tau)$ to be of the form $\vec{A}(\tau)=f(\tau)I$, $A_{0}(\tau)=0$. The subgroup of $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}\times\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$ which leaves $A(\tau)$ fixed is evidently the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ subgroup consisting of pairs $(G,R)$ such that $G=R$. Thus for any homogeneous perturbation $\vec{A}(\tau)+\vec{P}(\tau)\epsilon+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2})$ we may decompose 
\begin{equation}
P_{i}^{a}(\tau)=s(\tau)\delta_{i}^{a}+v^{j}(\tau)\varepsilon_{ija}+T_{i}^{a}(\tau)\label{eq:one-three-five}
\end{equation}
 where $v^{j}$ is a vector, $\varepsilon$ is the Levi-Civita symbol, and $T_{i}^{a}$ is a traceless symmetric tensor, corresponding to the decomposition $\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf{3}=\mathbf{1}\oplus\mathbf{3}\oplus\mathbf{5}$. Two remarks are in order:

Firstly, although this decomposition contains a scalar, vector and tensor, it differs from the SVT/helicity decomposition described in \prettyref{sec:helbas}. The latter applies to inhomogeneous perturbations, and it is defined in terms of charges under the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ subgroup of the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ corresponding to rotations around the axis specified by a Fourier mode. In contrast, \prettyref{eq:one-three-five} is a decomposition into irreducible $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ representations. 

Secondly, it's important to note that in the case where $A(\tau)$ is the zero gauge field (i.e. $f(\tau)=0$ for all~$\tau$), it is impossible to sensibly decompose perturbations (at least without some additional structure). This is because all of $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}\times\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$ acts trivially on the zero gauge field, and $\mathbf{3}_{\mathrm{gauge}}\otimes\mathbf{3}_{\mathrm{spatial}}$ is an irreducible representation of this full group. In contrast, when $f(\tau)\neq0$, $\vec{A}(\tau)$ determines an identification between spatial directions and Lie algebra directions, leading to a distinguished diagonal subgroup and enabling the previous decomposition to proceed.\footnote{For this reason, the analysis of non-abelian gauge theories is actually much easier when a non-zero background field is present. }

\subsection{\label{app:quant-aniso}Quantifying anisotropy}

The purpose of this subsection is to develop the tools used in \prettyref{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields} to measure the anisotropy of a homogeneous $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge-field background. These are the same tools needed to complete the proof of \prettyref{thm:isotropy}, which is carried out in \prettyref{app:isotrop-proof}. Throughout this subsection, we take $\vec{A}(\tau)$ to be an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge, but is not necessarily isotropic.

Recall from \prettyref{lem:matrix-isotropy} that a $3\times3$ matrix $M$ is \emph{isotropic} when its singular values are all equal in absolute value. We wish to apply this to the case $M=\vec{A}(\tau)$. In this case, left-multiplication by an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ matrix corresponds to the adjoint action of a spatially-constant $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge transformation. Right-multiplication by (the transpose of) an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ matrix corresponds to a spatial rotation. We seek scalars which are invariant under both left and right $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ transformations. Since $\dim(\mathrm{SO}(3))=3$, assuming that the two $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries are nondegenerate, we expect a total of $9-2\times3=3$ independent scalars. From \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn}, such scalars must be functions of the three singular values. A convenient choice is the polynomials 
\begin{align}
I_{2}(M) & \equiv\left|M\right|^{2}\equiv M_{i}^{a}M_{i}^{a}=\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{3}^{2},\label{eq:def-invariants}\\
I_{3}(M) & \equiv\det M_{i}^{a}=\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3},\nonumber \\
I_{4}(M) & \equiv\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon^{abc}M_{i}^{a}M_{j}^{b}\right)^{2}=\left(\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{3}\sigma_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)^{2}.\nonumber 
\end{align}
 As shown in \prettyref{thm:invariant-scalars}, any invariant scalar is determined as some function of these three quantities. (They also occur in Sec.~4.1.2 of \cite{mares2010}, where this problem occurs in a slightly different context.)

In the isotropic case $\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}=\sigma_{3}=f$, we have 
\begin{align*}
I_{2}(M) & =3f^{2},\qquad I_{3}(M)=f^{3}\qquad I_{4}(M)=3f^{4}.
\end{align*}

In the general case, these scalars satisfy certain inequalities. The inequality of arithmetic and geometric means implies that 
\[
3\sqrt{3}\left|\det M\right|\leq\left|M\right|^{3},
\]
 where the inequality is saturated when $M$ is isotropic (i.e. $\left|\sigma_{1}\right|=\left|\sigma_{2}\right|=\left|\sigma_{3}\right|$). Thus 
\[
-1\leq3\sqrt{3}\frac{I_{3}(M)}{\left|M\right|^{3}}\leq1,
\]
 with isotropy when $3\sqrt{3}\frac{I_{3}(M)}{\left|M\right|^{3}}=\pm1$. 

Note that $I_{4}(M)\geq0$ since it is a sum of squares, and $I_{4}(M)=0$ precisely when $M$ is rank-one or zero. Furthermore, note that 
\[
\left|M\right|^{4}-3I_{4}(M)=\tfrac{1}{6}(2\sigma_{1}^{2}-\sigma_{2}^{2}-\sigma_{3}^{2})^{2}+\textrm{cyclic permutations}\geq0,
\]
 where this inequality is saturated exactly when $M$ is isotropic. In summary,
\begin{gather}
0\leq\frac{3I_{4}(M)}{\left|M\right|^{4}}\leq1,\\
I_{4}(M)=0\textrm{ if and only if \ensuremath{M} is rank one or zero,}\label{eq:two-sv-vanish}\\
3I_{4}(M)-I_{2}(M)^{2}=0\textrm{ if and only if \ensuremath{M} is isotropic.}\label{eq:isotropy-characterization}
\end{gather}

As a sort of polar decomposition, we can consider the radial coordinate $\left|M\right|=\sqrt{I_{2}(M)}$ together with two other quantities which are invariant under scaling. As such, we define 
\begin{equation}
\left(D,E\right)\equiv\left(3\sqrt{3}\frac{I_{3}(M)}{\left|M\right|^{3}},\frac{3I_{4}(M)}{\left|M\right|^{4}}\right)\in\left[-1,1\right]\times\left[0,1\right].\label{eq:DE-def}
\end{equation}
 (Here $E$ is a scalar, and should not be confused with the electrical field $\vec{E}$ used in \prettyref{lem:rank-one-const}.) Not all points inside this rectangle can be realized. The points which are realized belong to the enclosed region in \prettyref{fig:DE-triangle} which resembles a triangle, but with curved edges. A nonzero matrix is isotropic precisely when it corresponds to either the left or right vertex, and the bottom vertex corresponds to rank-one matrices.

In \prettyref{eq:F-norm-fn} of \prettyref{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields} we introduce the radial quantity $F\equiv-\tau|M|/\sqrt{3}\xi$ in the context of $M=\vec{A}(\tau)$. In order to know whether the quantities $(D,E,F)$ are physically meaningful in this context, we must worry about gauge invariance. From \prettyref{exa:local-gt} \vpageref{exa:local-gt}, we note that $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ can fail to be gauge-invariant at any time $\tau_{0}$ when $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank-one or zero, i.e. when $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=0$. We show in \prettyref{thm:scalars-are-gauge-invt} that this is the only such case. Thus $I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ and $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ are always gauge-invariant, while $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ is gauge-invariant at all times $\tau_{0}$ for which $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$. In summary, for the case $M=\vec{A}(\tau)$, gauge-invariance of the quantities $(D,E,F)$ fails only at the rank-one point $(D,E)=(0,0)$ or when $F=0$. 

In any case of physical interest, this slight lack of gauge invariance presents no difficulties: trajectories with generic non-isotropic initial conditions should never pass through these bad points. Even when a non-generic trajectory passes through a bad point, a unique meaningful value of $F$ is determined by continuity.

\caption{\label{fig:DE-triangle}Only values inside the shaded region can be realized as pairs $(D,E)$ of an actual matrix. The left vertex corresponds to isotropy with $\sigma_{i}<0$. The right vertex corresponds to isotropy with $\sigma_{i}>0$. The bottom vertex corresponds to rank one. The boundary corresponds to when two or more singular values coincide. The upper edge corresponds to a coincidence in the larger two singular values, so it is traced out by $(1,1,\sigma_{3})$ for $\sigma_{3}\in\left[-1,1\right]$. The lower two edges correspond to a coincidence of the smaller singular values, i.e. ($\pm1$,$\sigma_{3}$,$\sigma_{3}$) for $\sigma_{3}\in\left[0,1\right]$. The defining equation of this region is $\zeta\protect\geq0$, where $\zeta$ is defined in \prettyref{eq:zeta-sv}.}

\subsubsection*{Completeness of the scalars $I_{n}(M)$}
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:invariant-scalars}Any scalar function of a $3\times3$ matrix $M$ which is invariant under both left and right multiplication by $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a function of $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
From the singular value decomposition of \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn}, any function of $M$ which is invariant under both left and right multiplication by $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ must be expressible in terms of the singular values of $M$. When considering functions of the singular values $(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3})$, there are two possible approaches. The first possibility is to impose a uniqueness condition on the singular values (such as the one stated in \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn}), so that any possible function of the singular values makes sense. Thus $\sigma_{1}$ denotes the largest singular value of $M$ (in absolute value). This approach is awkward because there is no algebraic expression for $\sigma_{1}(M)$ in terms of the components of $M$, so it is difficult to compute. 

The more natural approach is to consider only combinations of singular values which are invariant under rearrangements. The singular values are determined only up to permutation and flipping pairs of signs. Such freedom to rearrange the singular values may be seen explicitly by multiplying $\Sigma$ on the left and right by $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ matrices as follows:
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0\\
-1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{1}\\
 & \sigma_{2}\\
 &  & \sigma_{3}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right) & =\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{2}\\
 & \sigma_{1}\\
 &  & \sigma_{3}
\end{array}\right),\nonumber \\
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-1\\
 & -1\\
 &  & 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{1}\\
 & \sigma_{2}\\
 &  & \sigma_{3}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\\
 & 1\\
 &  & 1
\end{array}\right) & =\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-\sigma_{1}\\
 & -\sigma_{2}\\
 &  & \sigma_{3}
\end{array}\right).\label{eq:SVD-signs}
\end{align}
Assuming no degeneracies, this gives a total of 24 possible ways that $\Sigma$ can be rearranged (6 permutations times 4 possibilities for signs). Correspondingly, these rearrangements are given by the action of a group with 24 elements.\footnote{This group is the symmetric group $S_{4}$ in disguise: our group action is isomorphic to the standard action of the Weyl group of $\mathfrak{so}(6)$ on a Cartan subalgebra, $\mathfrak{so}(6)$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{su}(4)$, and the Weyl group of $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ is the symmetric group $S_{n}$.} Since this group action can rearrange an arbitrary triple of singular values $(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3})$ so that they satisfy the uniqueness constraints given in \prettyref{lem:SVD-SOn}, we conclude that this is the complete group of all possible rearrangements.

Next we explain how the singular values of $M$ can be reconstructed from $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$. Equivalently, given some numbers $I_{2}$, $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$, we wish to solve the algebraic system 
\begin{align}
\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{3}^{2} & =I_{2},\nonumber \\
\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3} & =I_{3},\nonumber \\
\left(\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{3}\sigma_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)^{2} & =I_{4}\label{eq:bezout-system}
\end{align}
 for $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$ and $\sigma_{3}$. It can happen that this system has no real solutions, for instance when $I_{2}<0$. However, we assume that the numbers $\left(I_{2},I_{3},I_{4}\right)$ arise from some matrix $M$, so that we are guaranteed that the system has at least one real solution. Since the $24$-element group acts on the solutions of this equation, there must be at \emph{least} 24 real solutions (when the solutions are counted with multiplicity). By B\'ezout's theorem (see for example \cite{shafarevich1994}), the number of real solutions is at \emph{most} $\deg I_{2}\cdot\deg I_{3}\cdot\deg I_{4}=2\cdot3\cdot4=24$ (counting multiplicities). Therefore, the number of real solutions to the system \eqref{eq:bezout-system} is \emph{exactly} 24 (counting multiplicities). Thus the information encoded in $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$ is precisely that of the 24 possible rearrangements of the singular values of the original matrix $M$. 

Finally, any invariant scalar function of $M$ can be written as an invariant function of the singular values of $M$, and the above procedure gives a recipe to solve for those singular values of $M$ in terms of $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$. Therefore, any invariant scalar function can be written as a function of $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$.
\end{proof}
We also present the following short abstract proof of \prettyref{thm:invariant-scalars}. (Details about the relevant combinatorics and Molien's Theorem can be found in Chapter 1 of \cite{mukai2003}.)
\begin{proof}
The polynomials $I_{n}(M)$ are readily verified to be algebraically independent functions of the $\sigma_{i}$ by the Jacobian criterion. Thus the $I_{n}(M)$ freely generate a subring of polynomials which are invariant under the group action, and the number of linearly independent polynomials in each degree is given by the generating function $\prod_{p=2}^{4}(1-t^{p})^{-1}$. By Molien's Theorem, a tedious but completely straightforward computation shows that the generating function for the full ring of invariant polynomials is given by the same expression. Thus the subring of invariant polynomials generated by $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$ spans the whole ring of invariant polynomials. Since the problem of determining invariant quantities is algebraic, if there are no missing polynomials then there are no missing functions. Thus all invariant scalars of $M$ are functions of $I_{2}(M)$, $I_{3}(M)$ and $I_{4}(M)$. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Gauge invariance of the scalars $I_{n}(\vec{A}(\tau))$}

We saw in \prettyref{exa:local-gt} that $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ fails to be gauge-invariant, so the scalars $I_{n}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ are of potentially dubious physical significance. However, it turns out that $I_{n}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ is gauge-invariant most of the time:
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:scalars-are-gauge-invt}For any $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field $\vec{A}(\tau)$ in homogeneous and temporal gauge, the quantities $I_{3}(\vec{A})$ and $I_{4}(\vec{A})$ are always gauge-invariant. Furthermore, $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))$ is gauge-invariant for all $\tau_{0}$ such that $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$.
\end{thm}

To prove this theorem, it suffices to show that each $I_{n}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))$ is expressible in terms of scalars which are known to be gauge-invariant. This can mostly be accomplished by considering the magnetic field matrix as in the following lemma:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:scalars-gauge-invt}For any $\tau_{0}$, the quantities $\left|I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\right|$ and $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))$ are gauge-invariant. If $I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$ then $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))$ is also gauge-invariant.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We introduce the magnetic field matrix 
\begin{equation}
B_{i}^{b}(\tau_{0})\equiv\tfrac{1}{2}a(\tau_{0})^{-2}\varepsilon_{ijk}F_{jk}^{b}(\tau_{0}),\label{eq:B-def}
\end{equation}
 and the corresponding comoving quantity 
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau)=a(\tau)^{2}\vec{B}(\tau)/e.\label{eq:cal-B}
\end{equation}
Since $\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0})$ transforms as a tensor under gauge transformations (see the proof of \prettyref{lem:elec-is-iso}), each $I_{n}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0}))$ is gauge-invariant. If the SVD of $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is $\vec{A}(\tau)=G_{1}(\tau)\Sigma^{A}(\tau)R_{1}(\tau)^{T}$ then
\begin{gather}
\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau)=G_{1}(\tau)\Sigma^{\mathcal{B}}(\tau)R_{1}(\tau)^{T},\quad\sigma_{1}^{\mathcal{B}}(\tau)=\sigma_{2}^{A}(\tau)\sigma_{3}^{A}(\tau)\ \textrm{ and cyclic permutations}.\label{eq:SV-AB}
\end{gather}
A short computation gives $\left|I_{3}(\vec{A})\right|=\sqrt{I_{3}(\vec{\mathcal{B}})}$ and $I_{4}(\vec{A})=I_{2}(\vec{\mathcal{B}})$. Since the expressions involving $I_{n}(\vec{\mathcal{B}})$ are gauge-invariant, so are the corresponding expressions involving $I_{n}(\vec{A})$. Finally, for all $\tau_{0}$ such that $I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$, we have $I_{3}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$, and so 
\[
I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=\frac{I_{2}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0}))^{2}-I_{4}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0}))}{3I_{3}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0}))}.
\]
\end{proof}
Because we are in the context of non-abelian gauge theory, it is impossible to fully reconstruct $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ from $\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0})$ up to gauge. For instance, $\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau_{0})$ carries no information about the sign of $I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))$. To sharpen the result of \prettyref{lem:scalars-gauge-invt} in order to prove \prettyref{thm:scalars-are-gauge-invt}, it is necessary to introduce a new quantity: 
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prettyref{thm:scalars-are-gauge-invt}]
 We introduce the tensorial quantity 
\[
\vec{\mathcal{C}}\equiv e^{-1}\,\vec{\nabla}^{(A)}\!\times\vec{\mathcal{B}}\quad\left(\mathcal{C}_{i}=e^{-1}\varepsilon_{ijk}\mathbf{D}_{j}\left(\mathcal{B}_{k}^{b}\mathbf{T}_{b}\right),\quad\mathcal{C}_{i}^{a}=e^{-2}F_{ij;j}^{a}\right),
\]
 where $\vec{\nabla}^{(A)}\times$ denotes the gauge-covariant curl operator, and the subscript $_{;j}$ denotes components corresponding to the gauge-covariant derivative $\mathbf{D}_{j}\mathbf{F}$. If the SVD of $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is $\vec{A}(\tau)=G_{1}(\tau)\Sigma^{A}(\tau)R_{1}(\tau)^{T}$ then $\vec{\mathcal{C}}(\tau)=G_{1}(\tau)\Sigma^{\mathcal{C}}(\tau)R_{1}(\tau)^{T}$, where 
\[
\sigma_{1}^{\mathcal{C}}=\left(\left(\sigma_{2}^{A}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{3}^{A}\right)^{2}\right)\sigma_{1}^{A}\ \textrm{ and cyclic permutations}.
\]
A quick computation shows that the gauge-invariant scalar $\mathcal{B}_{i}^{a}\mathcal{C}_{i}^{a}$ satisfies 
\[
\mathcal{B}_{i}^{a}\mathcal{C}_{i}^{a}=2I_{2}(\vec{A})I_{3}(\vec{A}),
\]
 and thus $I_{3}(\vec{A})$ is always given by the gauge-invariant expression 
\[
I_{3}(\vec{A})=\mathrm{sign}\left(\mathcal{B}_{i}^{a}\mathcal{C}_{i}^{a}\right)\,\sqrt{I_{3}(\vec{\mathcal{B}})}.
\]
 Finally, for all $\tau_{0}$ such that $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$, a quick computation shows that 
\[
I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=\frac{I_{2}(\vec{\mathcal{C}}(\tau_{0}))-3I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))^{2}}{I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))},
\]
 and the right-hand side involves only quantities which have been shown to be gauge-invariant. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{\label{app:isotrop-proof}The case when $A$ is isotropic but the matrix $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is not }

In this subsection we assume that $A$ is isotropic, and given by $\vec{A}(\tau)$ in homogeneous and temporal gauge (see \prettyref{app:homo-gauge}). Our goal is to prove \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact}, that it is always possible to find a particular homogeneous and temporal gauge in which $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is an isotropic matrix for all $\tau$. We must deal with the case observed in \prettyref{exa:local-gt}, where $\vec{A}(\tau)$ can be a rank-one matrix. 

In \prettyref{lem:isotropic-gf-relation} we derive a relation satisfied by $\vec{A}(\tau)$. \prettyref{lem:rewrite-isotropic-relation} then rewrites this relation so that in \prettyref{thm:iso-or-rank-one} we conclude for each $\tau_{0}$ that $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is either isotropic or rank-one. In \prettyref{lem:iso-open} we prove that if $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank-one, then it is rank-one for all nearby $\tau$. \prettyref{lem:rank-one-const} uses the electrical field to show that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is constant where it is rank-one. Finally, the proof of \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact} concludes that if $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank one for any $\tau_{0}$, then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is constant for all $\tau$. Thus it coincides with \prettyref{exa:local-gt} and can be made isotropic (and moreover zero) with a gauge transformation. 

First we prove a relation which holds for $\vec{A}(\tau)$: 
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:isotropic-gf-relation}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge. Then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ satisfies 
\[
I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}-3I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}=0
\]
 for all $\tau$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The matrix $\vec{{\cal B}}(\tau)$ is isotropic for all $\tau$ by the proof of \prettyref{lem:elec-is-iso}. From \prettyref{eq:isotropy-characterization} it follows that $I_{2}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau))^{2}-3I_{4}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau))=0$. From \prettyref{eq:SV-AB}, 
\[
I_{2}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau))^{2}-3I_{4}(\vec{\mathcal{B}}(\tau))=I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}-3I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))I_{3}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}.
\]
\end{proof}
We rewrite the characterization given in \prettyref{lem:isotropic-gf-relation} into a form which more clearly implies that the matrix is either isotropic or rank-one:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:rewrite-isotropic-relation}Suppose $M_{0}$ is a matrix which satisfies $I_{4}(M_{0})^{2}-3I_{2}(M_{0})I_{3}(M_{0})^{2}=0$. Then 
\[
I_{4}(M_{0})\left(I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}-3I_{4}(M_{0})\right)=0.
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We will make use of the quantity 
\[
\zeta(I_{2},I_{3},I_{4})\equiv\left(I_{2}I_{4}\right)^{2}+18I_{2}I_{3}^{2}I_{4}-4\left(I_{4}^{3}+I_{2}^{3}I_{3}^{2}\right)-27I_{3}^{4}.
\]
 It is easily verified that for any matrix $M$, 
\begin{equation}
\zeta(M)\equiv\zeta(I_{2}(M),I_{3}(M),I_{4}(M))=\left(\left(\sigma_{1}^{2}-\sigma_{2}^{2}\right)\left(\sigma_{2}^{2}-\sigma_{3}^{2}\right)\left(\sigma_{3}^{2}-\sigma_{1}^{2}\right)\right)^{2}\geq0.\label{eq:zeta-sv}
\end{equation}
 As an aside, one can also show the converse: if $\zeta(I_{2},I_{3},I_{4})\geq0$ then there exists a matrix $M$ such that $I_{n}=I_{n}(M)$. Thus the triangular region shown in \prettyref{fig:DE-triangle} is characterized by $\zeta\geq0$. 

Suppose now that $M_{0}$ is any matrix which satisfies 
\begin{equation}
I_{4}(M_{0})^{2}-3I_{2}(M_{0})I_{3}(M_{0})^{2}=0.\label{eq:A-iso-poly}
\end{equation}
 Consider the quantity $\zeta(M_{0})I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}$. From \prettyref{eq:zeta-sv} we know that $\zeta(M_{0})I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}\geq0$. However, using \prettyref{eq:A-iso-poly} to eliminate $I_{3}(M_{0})$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\zeta(M_{0})I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}=-\tfrac{1}{3}\left(\left(I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}-3I_{4}(M_{0})\right)I_{4}(M_{0})\right)^{2}\leq0.\label{eq:eliminate-I3}
\end{equation}
 Since $0\leq\zeta(M_{0})I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}\leq0$, we conclude that $\zeta(M_{0})I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}=0$, and thus by the equality in \prettyref{eq:eliminate-I3}, 
\[
\left(I_{2}(M_{0})^{2}-3I_{4}(M_{0})\right)I_{4}(M_{0})=0.
\]
\end{proof}
We therefore have the following conclusion:
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:iso-or-rank-one}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge. Then for each time $\tau_{0}$, either $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is isotropic or $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank-one. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By \prettyref{lem:isotropic-gf-relation} combined with \prettyref{lem:rewrite-isotropic-relation}, 
\begin{equation}
\left(I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}-3I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))\right)I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))=0.\label{eq:reduced-isotropy-A}
\end{equation}
 Thus for any $\tau_{0}$, either $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=0$ or $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))^{2}-3I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=0$, and the result follows from \eqref{eq:two-sv-vanish} and \eqref{eq:isotropy-characterization}.
\end{proof}
The following two lemmas will imply that if $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank one for some $\tau_{0}$ then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is constant. 
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:iso-open}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge. If there is some $\tau_{0}$ such that $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank-one, then $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is rank-one along some interval containing $\tau_{0}$ in its interior. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
First, note that by solving \prettyref{eq:reduced-isotropy-A} for $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{1}))$ at any time $\tau_{1}$, the number $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{1}))$ may equal either $0$ or $\tfrac{1}{3}I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{1}))^{2}$. Now suppose that there is some time $\tau_{0}$ for which the matrix $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is not an isotropic matrix. By \prettyref{thm:iso-or-rank-one}, $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ must be rank-one. Thus from \prettyref{eq:two-sv-vanish}, $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=0$ but $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))\neq0$. Assuming the continuity of $\vec{A}(\tau)$, it follows that there is some interval containing $\tau_{0}$ along which $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))\neq0$. Also by continuity, $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau))$ along this same interval must be equal to either the positive branch $\tfrac{1}{3}I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))^{2}$ or the zero branch. Since $I_{4}(\vec{A}(\tau_{0}))=0$, we conclude that it must be the zero branch. Therefore, $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is rank-one for this whole interval along which $I_{2}(\vec{A}(\tau))\neq0$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:rank-one-const}Let $\vec{A}(\tau)$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field in homogeneous and temporal gauge. Along any interval where $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is rank-one, it is constant. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Recall from \prettyref{eq:E-is-derivative} that $\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\vec{A}(\tau)=\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$. Thus in order to show that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is constant along some interval, it suffices to show that $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)=0$ along the same interval. 

From \prettyref{lem:elec-is-iso} it follows that $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ is always an isotropic matrix. By \prettyref{lem:matrix-isotropy}, $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})$ is a scalar multiple of an orthogonal matrix for each $\tau_{0}$. Since orthogonal matrices are invertible, the only scalar multiple of an orthogonal matrix which has a nonzero nullspace is the zero matrix. Thus the lemma follows if we show that $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau_{0})$ has a nonzero nullspace. 

The singular value decomposition of $\vec{A}(\tau)$ in the rank-one case (see \prettyref{def:rank-one}) gives the $3\times3$ matrix equation 
\[
\vec{A}(\tau)=\vec{v}(\tau)\sigma_{1}(\tau)\vec{w}(\tau)^{T},
\]
 where $\vec{v}(\tau)$ denotes the first column of $G(\tau)$ and $\vec{w}(\tau)$ is the first column of $R(\tau)$. Thus 
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)=\vec{v}(\tau)\,\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\left(\sigma_{1}(\tau)\vec{w}(\tau)^{T}\right)+\left(\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\vec{v}(\tau)\right)\sigma_{1}(\tau)\vec{w}(\tau)^{T}.\label{eq:E-rk-1-as-derivative}
\end{equation}
 Choosing any nonzero vector $\vec{s}(\tau)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ which is orthogonal to both $\vec{v}(\tau)$ and $\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\vec{v}(\tau)$, it is clear from \prettyref{eq:E-rk-1-as-derivative} that $\vec{s}(\tau)^{T}\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ vanishes. Thus $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(\tau)$ has a nonzero left-nullspace, proving the lemma.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact}Let $A$ be a homogeneous and isotropic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field. There exists a homogeneous and temporal gauge for $A$ in which $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is an isotropic matrix for all $\tau$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By \prettyref{thm:hom-temp-gauge} we may assume that $A$ is in homogeneous and temporal gauge. If $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is isotropic for all $\tau$ then we are done. Alternatively, if $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is a constant rank-one matrix for all $\tau$ as in \prettyref{exa:local-gt} then we are done because \prettyref{exa:local-gt} is gauge-equivalent to zero, and zero is isotropic. By \prettyref{thm:iso-or-rank-one}, the only other possibility is that $\vec{A}(\tau_{0})$ is rank-one at some time $\tau_{0}$, but $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is non-constant. However, this cannot happen by \prettyref{lem:iso-open} and \prettyref{lem:rank-one-const}. 
\end{proof}
As a result of \prettyref{thm:rk1-is-gauge-artifact}, when $A$ is homogeneous and isotropic we may assume without loss of generality that $\vec{A}(\tau)$ is an isotropic matrix for all $\tau$.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Gravity and electromagnetism are the only two long range interactions in nature, but over the centuries we have explored the Universe only through electromagnetic waves, covering more than 20 orders of magnitude in frequencies, from radio to gamma rays. The discovery of gravitational waves in 2015 has opened a totally new window to observe our Universe~\cite{Abbott:2016blz}.

Judging by what happens with electromagnetic waves, there should be interesting physics to be discovered at every scale of gravitational wave frequencies. Current and planned projects such as pulsar timing arrays, as well as ground- and space-based interferometers will explore gravitational waves in the well-motivated range of frequencies between the nHz and kHz range. However, both from the experimental and the theoretical point of view it is worth to consider the possibility to search for gravitational waves of much higher frequencies, covering regimes such as the MHz and GHz, see for instance~\cite{Cruise:2012zz}.

A strong motivation to explore higher frequencies from the theoretical perspective is that there are no known astrophysical objects which are small and dense enough to emit at frequencies beyond $10 \,$ kHz. Any discovery of gravitational waves at higher frequencies would thus indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, linked e.g.\ to exotic astrophysical objects (such as primordial black holes or boson stars) or to cosmological events in the early Universe such as phase transitions, preheating after inflation, oscillons, cosmic strings, thermal fluctuations after reheating, etc., see~\cite{Caprini:2018mtu} for a recent review.

For early Universe cosmology, gravitational waves may be the only way to observe various events. In particular for the time between the Big Bang and the emission of the cosmic microwave background radiation, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate freely, whereas, due to the weakness of gravity, gravitational waves decouple essentially immediately after being produced and travel undisturbed throughout the Universe forming a stochastic background that could eventually be detected. Even though it may not be easy to unambiguously determine the concrete cosmological source of a gravitational wave signal, its cosmological nature of the spectrum may be identified, similar to what happened with the original discovery of the cosmic microwave background.

In this context, the existence of a stochastic spectrum in the range from kHz to GHz is well-motivated: causality restricts the gravitational wave wavelength to be smaller than the cosmological horizon size at the time of gravitational wave production. This roughly implies a gravitational wave frequency above the frequency range of the existing laser interferometers Virgo~\cite{AdvVirgo,PhysRevLett.123.231108}, LIGO~\cite{aLIGO2015,PhysRevLett.116.131103,PhysRevD.102.062003,PhysRevLett.123.231107} and KAGRA~\cite{Akutsu:2018axf,PhysRevD.88.043007} for any gravitational wave production mechanism that happens at temperatures larger than $10^{10}$ GeV,\footnote{Cosmological events occurring at lower temperatures can also source such high-frequencies gravitational waves if the typical scale of the source is hierarchically smaller than the horizon at that time.}
assuming radiation domination all the way to matter-radiation equality. In particular, GHz frequencies correspond to the horizon size at the highest energies conceivable in particle physics (such as the Grand Unification or string scale) and phenomena like phase transitions and preheating after inflation would naturally produce gravitational waves with frequencies around the GHz range.

Established gravitational wave detector designs are limited to frequencies up to the kHz range. In particular, resonant mass detectors, going back to the original bar design of Joe Weber~\cite{Weber1967}, focused on isolated high-frequencies, often targeting known millisecond-pulsar frequencies. Similarly, the well-established interferometric gravitational wave detectors LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA cover parts of the high-frequency band up to a few kHz. For the purposes of this white paper, we shall therefore use the expression \emph{high-frequency gravitational waves} to refer to frequencies that are above the LIGO detection band, i.e.\ starting from around {10}~{kHz}. In particular, taking inspiration from the electromagnetic spectrum, we denote the MHz to GHz range by \textit{Ultra High-Frequency Gravitational Waves} (UHF-GWs). Several proposals have been made for pushing the high-frequency end of interferometric detectors into this region, however, detectors for the MHz, GHz and THz frequency bands require radically different experimental approaches.

Over the years there have been isolated attempts to search for gravitational waves of very high-frequencies and a few proposals have been put forward. These new concepts have largely been suggested in the form of theoretical papers with no serious discussion of the potential experimental noise sources that might limit their performance, or occasionally, bench tests of early prototypes. The current status of many of these ideas must be regarded as highly preliminary. The published concepts span a wide range of technologies with no real consensus yet as to where to concentrate the community effort. In addition to the selection of suitable technological pathways towards a serious attempt at a detection at high-frequencies, there needs to be an identification of the most realistic sources and thereby the waveforms and spectra for which such detectors should be optimised. This process demands a close collaboration of theorists and experimentalists.
%

The goal of this report is to summarise and start a dialogue among the specialised community regarding the importance and feasibility to explore searches for high-frequency gravitational waves. We are aware that this may be a long term goal but are convinced that the physics motivation is strong enough to start a systematic study of the different sources of high-frequency gravitational waves and their potential detectability. It is the purpose of this white paper to put together the different ideas both from theory and experiment to explore the importance of searching for high-frequency gravitational waves. The origin of this initiative was a workshop organised at ICTP in October 2019 `Challenges and Opportunities of High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection' where members of the theoretical and experimental communities interested on high-frequency gravitational waves got together to explore the motivations and challenges towards this search. This workshop and the present white paper set the stage for the launch of the Ultra-High-Frequency Gravitational Wave (UHF-GW) initiative\footnote{Check out the \href{http://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/activities/UHF-GW.php}{\underline{website}} of the initiative.}, whose goals include supporting the testing phase of currently existing detector proposals and stimulating the technological developments necessary to come up with new schemes for gravitational wave detectors at high frequencies.


The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:Notation} introduces some basic concepts and notation to discuss different types of gravitational wave sources and to relate them to experimental sensitivities. An overview over gravitational wave sources in the late and early Universe is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:th}, followed by a discussion of different detector concepts in Sec.~\ref{sec:exp}. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}. For a summary of the various detector concepts and the corresponding sensitivities see Sec.~\ref{sec:SummarySensitivities} and Tab.~\ref{tab:SummarySensitivity}. For a summary of the various sources see Sec.~\ref{sec:Summary}, Fig.s~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary}, \ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary}, App.~\ref{sec:SummaryTable} and Tab.s~\ref{tab:summary-coherent},~\ref{tab:summary-stochastic}.\\

We collect here a few acronyms that will be used throughout the paper: Gravitational Wave (GW), Ultra High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (UHF-GWs), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Black Hole (BH), Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).

\section{Setting up the notation: comparing different GW sources and detectors}
\label{sec:Notation}

Depending on the source/detector, the strength of GWs, detector noise, and signal-to-noise ratio are described using various different metrics~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}. In general, before using any given metric, it is important to make sure that it is appropriately defined for the scenario under consideration.
In this section we summarize the relevant quantities and notation. We follow the definition in Ref.~\cite{Allen:1999stochastic} for stochastic strain sources, and definitions in Ref.~\cite{Moore:2014sen} for time-dependent strain sources.

\subsection{Gravitational wave sources at high-frequencies}


\begin{enumerate}

\item For stochastic GWs, for example those coming from cosmological sources, a spectral density prescription is most suitable. The most common models assume that they are approximately isotropic, unpolarized, stationary, and have a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. They can thus be fully defined by the second moment~\cite{Allen:1999stochastic}:
\begin{gather}
    \frac{1}{2}\delta^2(\Omega,\Omega')\delta_{AA'} \delta(f-f')\,S_h(f) \equiv \langle \tilde{h}_A(f,\Omega) \tilde{h}_{A'}^*(f',\Omega') \rangle  \,.
    \label{eq:Sh}
\end{gather}

Here $\tilde{h}_A(f,\Omega)$ is the Fourier transform\footnote{Our convention for the Fourier transform (denoted by a tilde) is $\tilde{h}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \, h(t)\, e^{- 2 \pi i f t} $.} of the time-dependent strain in the GW polarization $A$, solid angle $\Omega$, evaluated at a frequency $f$. $S_h(f)$ denotes the one-sided power spectral density.

The energy-density $\rho_\text{GW}$ in GWs per logarithmic frequency interval is represented by $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}$,
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f) = \frac{1}{\rho_c} \frac{\partial \rho_{\rm GW}}{\partial \ln{f}} \,,
\end{equation}
conventionally normalized by the critical energy density $\rho_c = 3 H_0^2/(8 \pi G)$ with $G$ denoting Newton's constant and $H_0$ denoting the Hubble parameter today. We will denote the current value of $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ by $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0}$.


The power-spectral density can be directly related to the 00-component of the stress energy tensor, in turn yielding:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{3 H_0^2}{8\pi^2} \Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)\, f^{-3}\, \delta^2(\Omega,\Omega')  \delta_{AA'} \delta(f-f')= \langle \tilde{h}_A(f,\Omega) \tilde{h}_{A'}^*(f',\Omega') \rangle \,.
\end{equation}

Often, a dimensionless characteristic strain is assigned to the normalized energy density for stochastic GWs (see for instance~\cite{Thrane:2013_sen,Romano:2017Detection})
%
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{gather}
        h_{c,\rm sto}(f) \equiv \sqrt{f\, S_h(f)} \,,\label{eq:charstrainstochastic}\\
        \Omega_\mathrm{GW} = \frac{4\pi^2}{3H_0^2}f^2 h_{c,\rm sto}^2(f) \,.    \label{eq:OmegaAmplitude}
    \end{gather}
\end{subequations}


\item For inspiral sources, such as BH mergers, a time-dependent strain $h(t)$ can be obtained directly from Einstein's equations. Inspirals have an evolving frequency evolution, so usually the stationary phase approximation is used to obtain an analytical form for the Fourier transform  $\tilde{h}(f)$~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}. The characteristic strain for such sources with inspiralling frequency can be defined so as to take the frequency evolution into account in the GW strength~\cite{Moore:2014sen},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hc}
    h_{c,\rm insp} = 2 f \tilde{h}(f) \,.%\label{eq:charstraininsphft}
\end{equation}
Assuming that $h_0$ is the amplitude of the GW from the inspiral, i.e.\ the amplitude of the periodic function $h(t)$, this results in the characteristic strain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:h0}
    h_{c,\rm insp}(f)   = \sqrt{\frac{2f^2}{\dot{f}}} h_0 \,.%\label{eq:charstraininsph0}
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detectors}

Each detector has a different way of searching for GWs, with different antenna patterns, frequency bands, binning, etc. This should be taken into account when defining the appropriate noise and signal-to-noise metrics. For interferometers (such as LIGO) the impact of spatial antenna patterns is of the order of unity. For simplicity, the detector noise floor is usually specified assuming the noise is stationary and Gaussian (even though in reality it is usually neither). Similar to the discussion of stochastic GWs, this noise floor is specified by using a power spectral density,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{2} \delta(f-f') S_n(f) = \langle \tilde{n}(f) \tilde{n}(f')\rangle \,.
\end{equation}
%
The angular brackets denote an average over multiple realizations of the system, which is obtained repeating the measure of the noise over several well separated time intervals of the same length, see~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}.\footnote{This assumes that the system is ergodic, hence it is possible to trade an ensemble average with a time average.} In order to measure this noise,  a fast Fourier transform of the detector noise in the absence of the signal is performed. This measured noise is compared to a numerical model, comprising of the sum of all the noises in the detector. An analysis showing each individual noise source (measured or modeled) summing up to the total measured noise is called the \textit{noise budget}.

Unless otherwise specified, if a detector noise is specified in terms of spectral density, it should be treated as $S_n(f)$ (with $\langle\overline{|n(t)|^2}\rangle = \int \mathrm{d}f\, S_n(f)$) if it is in Hz$^{-1}$, or $\sqrt{S_n(f)}$ if it is specified in $1/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. For a visual comparison of signal strengths of inspirals and stochastic signals against detector sensitivities, conventionally a dimensionless noise amplitude as been introduced, denoted by $h_{c,n}$~\cite{Moore:2014sen}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DimlessNoiseAmplitude}
    h_{c,n} \equiv \sqrt{f S_n(f)} \,.
\end{equation}

Some experiments looking for long-lived sources (e.g. monochromatic sources or stochastic sources) can choose to average the noise over a long time. This gives an additional boost in signal-to-noise ratio, which is sometimes reported as an enhanced sensitivity
\begin{equation}
	S_{n,\mathrm{int}} = \frac{S_{n}}{{N_\mathrm{avg}}} \,.
\end{equation}
If the detector is operating at a frequency $f_\mathrm{center}$ and it is integrating for a time $T_\mathrm{obs}$ then $N_\mathrm{avg} = T_\mathrm{obs}/T_\mathrm{FFT}$ where $T_\mathrm{FFT}$ is the time duration of each spectrum (assuming the segments can be coherently averaged over the duration $T_\mathrm{obs}$).



\subsection{Signal-to-noise ratio}

Understanding whether a signal is detectable using a particular detector requires development of a metric for the signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$.

\begin{itemize}
\item The most efficient signal-to-noise ratio metric for broadband detection of transient sources uses matched-filtering~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz,allen:2012findchirp,Moore:2014sen}:
\begin{equation}
    \rho^2 = \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}f~  4 \frac{|\tilde{h}(f)|^2}{S_n(f)} = \int d \ln f \, \frac{|h_{c,\rm insp}(f)|^2}{f S_n(f)} \,.
\end{equation}
If the frequency ranges of both the signal and the detector are sufficiently broad, $d \ln f = {\cal O}(1)$, then $h_{c, \rm insp} \sim h_{c,n}$ roughly corresponds to $\rho = {\cal O}(1)$. This explains why $h_{c, \rm insp}$ and $h_{c,n}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:DimlessNoiseAmplitude} are useful in assessing the reach of a particular broadband instrument looking for an inspiralling source.

\item For a resonant detector with no sensitivity outside a small bandwidth, this signal-to-noise ratio simply collapses to the single frequency band of detection,
\begin{equation}
    \rho^2_\mathrm{res}(f_\mathrm{center},\Delta f) \sim 4 \Delta f ~  \frac{|\tilde{h}(f_\mathrm{center})|^2}{S_n(f_\mathrm{center})} \,,
    \label{eq:SNR_res}
\end{equation}
indicating that a correspondingly larger threshold value of $\tilde h(f)$ is required to yield a detectable signal at fixed $h_{c,n}$.

\item For detecting approximately monochromatic sources, the signal-to-noise ratio similarly collapses to a single frequency. In this case, $\Delta f$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SNR_res} is given by the frequency resolution, i.e.\ either the width of the signal or the detector resolution, whatever is the relevant limiting factor. For searches of monochromatic GWs that last over long times, various astrophysical effects like the Earth's motion need to be taken into account.

\item Detecting stochastic sources usually requires utilizing cross-correlation between two or more GW experiments to distinguish the GW background from the experiment's noise (see also Sec.~\ref{sec:crosscorrelation}). Therefore, defining a meaningful signal-to-noise ratio for detection of stochastic sources requires careful consideration of the noise, location, and alignment of each individual experiment. The signal-to-noise ratio can be increased by using more independent experiments, observing for longer times, and optimizing the size of frequency bins. Usually, the strength of the signal will be much less than the detector noise, so cross-correlation can provide a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.
For a simple case of $M>1$ colocated detectors, measuring in a frequency band from $f_\mathrm{min}$ to $f_\mathrm{max}$ for a time $T_\mathrm{obs}$, the signal-to-noise ratio can be written as~\cite{Thrane:2013_sen}:
\begin{equation}
    \rho^2_\mathrm{sto} = T_\mathrm{obs} M(M-1) \int_{f_\mathrm{min}}^{f_\mathrm{max}} df\, \frac{S^2_h(f)}{S^2_n(f)} \,\label{eq:SNRsto}.
\end{equation}
We redirect the reader to Refs.~\cite{Allen:1999stochastic,Thrane:2013_sen,Romano:2017Detection} for a full analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison of signal strength and noise for narrowband detectors}
\label{sec:ComparisonSignalStrength}

Since most high-frequency detectors are narrowband\footnote{We define a detector to be narrowband if its bandwidth is small enough such that the data is analyzed in a single bin, i.e. the noise is assumed to be frequency independent over the bandwidth and infinite outside the bandwidth.}, here we provide some handy expressions to compare signal strength and detector sensitivity for narrowband detectors. The most natural way to express a detector's sensitivity is in power or amplitude spectral density, \(S_n(f)\) or \(\sqrt{S_n(f)}\). On the other hand for signal strengths, the most natural units can depend on the type of source - dimensionless characteristic strain for inspirals, amplitude or power spectral density for stochastic sources, and wave amplitude for long-lived monochromatic sources. In order to compare the signal strength and detector sensitivity, we often strive to convey them in the same units. Here we will provide two ways to achieve this for narrowband detectors. The underlying principle for both methods is to first write down a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio metric, and use that to derive the appropriate comparable quantity. The signal-to-noise ratio for stochastic and long-lived monochromatic sources will be enhanced due to the integration over the observation time, in contrast with signal-to-noise ratio for transient sources, which will depend on just a single observation.

If we are interested in assessing the utility of a given detector to search for GWs from various types of sources, it would be natural to include the integration-time information in the signal depending on the source. On the other hand, if we wish to compare various detectors' suitability to a given source, it is convenient to include the time and bandwidth information to convert the detector sensitivity to the source units. Here we provide ways to do both.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Inspirals:}
		For inspiralling sources passing through the band of a narrowband detector, the signal-to-noise ratio is shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SNR_res}, and the Fourier transform \(\tilde{h}(f)\) is related to the characteristic strain using Eq.~\eqref{eq:hc}.
		We desire \(S_\mathrm{h,res,insp}\) or \(h_{c,n,\rm insp}\) such that
		\begin{subequations}
			\begin{align}
				\rho^2_\mathrm{res,insp}(f,\Delta f) \,= \,& \frac{\Delta f}{f^2} \frac{\left|h_{c,\rm insp}(f)\right|^2}{S_n(f)}\\
				\equiv \, & \frac{S_\mathrm{h,res,insp}(f)}{S_n(f)} \\
				\equiv \,& \frac{\left|h_{c,\rm insp}(f)\right|^2}{\left|h_{c,n,\rm insp}(f)\right|^2} \,,
			\end{align}
			\label{eq:convert_narrorband_insp}
		\end{subequations}
which using Eq.~\eqref{eq:SNR_res} gives
		\begin{subequations}
			\begin{align}
				\sqrt{S_\mathrm{h,res,insp}(f)} \sim &\, 2\sqrt{\Delta f} \left|\tilde{h}(f)\right|  
				\,, 
				\\
				\left|h_{c,n,\rm insp}(f)\right| \sim&\, \sqrt{\frac{f^2}{\Delta f}S_n(f)} 
				\,,
			\end{align}
		\end{subequations}
  where \(\Delta f\) represents the frequency range in which GWs are measured by a given detector, i.e., \(f\pm\Delta f/2\).
	\item \textbf{Stochastic sources:}
		Following the same prescription as above, we write the narrowband version of the signal-to-noise ratio in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SNRsto}:
		\begin{equation}
			\rho^2_\mathrm{res,sto} \sim\, T_\mathrm{obs}  \Delta f\, \frac{S_h^2(f)}{S_n^2(f)}\label{eq:SNR_res_sto} \,.
		\end{equation}
		Using Eqs.~\eqref{eq:SNR_res_sto} and\eqref{eq:charstrainstochastic}, we can obtain
		\begin{subequations}
			\begin{align}
				\sqrt{S_\mathrm{h,res,sto}} \sim& \left(T_\mathrm{obs}  \Delta f\right)^{1/4} \sqrt{S_h(f)} 
				= \left( \frac{N_\mathrm{avg}\Delta f}{f}\right)^{1/4}\sqrt{S_h(f)}
%				= \left( \frac{N_\mathrm{avg}}{\tilde{Q}}\right)^{1/4}\sqrt{S_h(f)}
				 \,, \\
				\left|h_{c,n,\rm sto}\right| \sim& \left(\frac{1}{T_\mathrm{obs}\Delta f }\right)^{1/4} \sqrt{f S_n(f)} 
%				=  \left(\frac{\tilde{Q} f}{T_\mathrm{obs}}\right)^{1/4}\sqrt{S_n(f)} 
\,.\label{eq:charnoisesto}
			\end{align}
		\end{subequations}
	\item \textbf{Monochromatic sources:}

	For long-lived monochromatic sources, the natural unit to specify the signal strength is just the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave, \(h_0\).
	The signal-to-noise ratio buildup is from the long integration times and can be written as
	\begin{equation}
		\rho^2_\mathrm{res,mono} \sim \frac{\left|h_0\right|^2 T_\mathrm{obs} }{S_n(f)} \label{eq:SNR_res_mono}\,.
	\end{equation}
	Using this, noise-equivalent signal \(\sqrt{S_\mathrm{n,res,\rm mono}}\) or signal-equivalent noise \(h_{0,n,\rm mono}\) can be written  \footnote{As is the case in LIGO and VIRGO, a more complicated analysis is needed if the coherence duration of the detector is shorter than $T_\mathrm{obs}$. In that case, fast Fourier transforms taken over the coherence duration are incoherently averaged. This leads to a modified scaling $\rho^2_\mathrm{res,mono}\sim \frac{ |h_0|^2N^{1/2}_\mathrm{avg} T_\mathrm{FFT}}{S_n}$\cite{Astone:2014method}.}:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\sqrt{S_\mathrm{n,res,mono}} \sim \left|h_0\right|\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}} \,,\\
			\left|h_{0,n, \rm mono}\right| = \sqrt{\frac{S_n(f)}{T_\mathrm{obs}}} \,.
			\label{eq:h0mono}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	Note that for monochromatic sources, there is no need to invent a characteristic strain, the most `characteristic' strain is the amplitude \(h_0\) itself.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sources}
\label{sec:th}
This section reviews various production mechanisms for GW signals in the high-frequency regime, typically in the range $(\text{kHz} - \text{GHz})$, that fall into two broad classes. In Sec.~\ref{sec:lateU} we discuss sources in our cosmological neighbourhood, which emit coherent transient and/or monochromatic GW signals. In Sec.~\ref{sec:earlyU} we turn to sources at cosmological distances which typically lead to a stochastic background of GWs. We emphasize that all proposed sources, with the notable exceptions of the neutron star mergers discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:NS} (kHz range) and the cosmic gravitational microwave background discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:CGMB}, require new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics to produce an observable GW signal. Thus, while being admittedly somewhat speculative, these proposals provide unique opportunities to shed light on the fundamental laws of nature, even by `only' setting an upper bound on the existence of GWs in the corresponding frequency range.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:Summary}

Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} summarize a representative selection of the sources which are discussed in more detail in the following subsections. The regions bounded by the colored curves illustrate the region of parameter space which may be covered by the corresponding source for appropriate parameter choices as specified below. Except for the cases of inflation with broken spatial reparametrization symmetry and the cosmic gravitational microwave background they should not be mistaken for GW spectra obtained for a fixed model parameter choice. 

In the same figures, we also indicate the demonstrated (filled boxes) or expected (empty boxes) sensitivity of the detector concepts discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:detectors}.
In some cases we report two sensitivities for a single detector, using two different intensities of the same color (see for instance the case of levitated sensors), if the sensitivity depends on the details of the future implementation of the detector or on some assumptions needed to place the constraint. In  the case of the levitated sensors the two colors refer to two different versions of the same detector concept: a 1 meter and a 100 meter implementation, see Sec.~\ref{sec:OpticallyLevitatedSensors}, the latter giving a better sensitivity and in the case of the radiotelescopes EDGES and ARCADE, the two sensitivities refer to the weakest and strongest possible cosmic magnetic field, whose value is needed in order to place the constraint, see Sec.~\ref{sec:inv_gertsenshtein}.

The comparison of signal strength and detector sensitivity in these figures should be taken with great caution, and serves as a very rough illustration only. In particular, the signals in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} are coherent (and partially transient) signals whereas the signals depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary}  are stationary isotropic stochastic signals. A given detector concept will be more or less suitable for these different types of signals, which is not accounted for in this illustration. Further restriction may apply. For example, the quoted sensitivity for the radio telescopes ARCADE and EDGES assumes a cosmological distance between source and observer.
%
Regarding the possible signals, we have aimed to make realistic estimates of the largest possible signals in different models. This does however not factor in the likelihood of such a signal occurring in the detector lifespan. This is in particular true for the coherent sources, see the respective subsections for details.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{CoherentSources_Final.pdf}
    \caption{Examples of coherent sources of GWs, see text for details. {Details about the various detector concepts are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:100MHzInterferometers} for the $0.75$ m interferometer and the holometer experiment, Sec.~\ref{sec:OpticallyLevitatedSensors} for the optically levitated sensors, Sec.~\ref{sec:inv_gertsenshtein} for IAXO Single Photon Detector (SPD), IAXO Heterodyne radio receiver (HET), OSQAR, CAST, ALPS II, JURA, EDGES and ARCADE, Sec.~\ref{sec:AmplificationMethods}, Sec.~\ref{sec:BAW} for the Bulk Acoustic Wave Devices (BAW) and Sec.~\ref{sec:GravitonMagnonResonance} the graviton-magnon resonance effect.}}
    \label{fig:hc_coherent_summary}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} shows representative examples of coherent sources. {For simplicity, we take the factor $\sqrt{\frac{2f}{\dot{f}}}$ converting between the amplitude and characteristic strain of a GW to be unity, which is a good approximation at the merging frequency of compact objects. We moreover use a reference value of 10~kpc for the distance to all sources.}
%
\begin{itemize}
 \item For the ringdown signal of neutron star mergers (Sec.~\ref{sec:NS}) we depict a benchmark at $h_c \simeq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ and $1000<f<5000$ Hz, see Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}.
 \item {For mergers of compact objects, i.e.\ primordial BHs (Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers}) and exotic compact objects (Sec.~\ref{sec:ECOs}) we take the masses of both merging partners to be equal and estimate the maximal signal by determining for each frequency the maximal mass contributing to mergers at this frequency (i.e.\ the mass corresponding to $f = f_\text{ISCO}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fISCO-PBH} or Eq.~\eqref{eq:fISCO-ECO}). For the frequency range depicted, this corresponds to the mass range $(10^{-9}, 1) \, M_\odot$ for primordial BHs. For exotic compact objects, we vary the compactness as $5 \times 10^{-2} < C < 1/2$. The amplitude of the oscillating GW signal is then given by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:h0-PBH} and \eqref{eq:h0-ECO}, respectively. }
 \item {For signals from axion superradiance we consider both the axion annihilation and axion decay channel (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Superradiance}). The frequency of the signal is determined by the axion mass, which is in turn linked to the BH mass by the superradiance condition in Eq.~\eqref{eq:maMBH}. Inserting this into Eq.~\eqref{eq:strain_axion_annihilation} and Eq.~\eqref{GWhg1} and taking $\alpha/l =1/2$, $\epsilon=10^{-3}$ and $M_\text{BH} > M_\odot$ yields the curves depicted.}
\end{itemize}

Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} shows models producing stochastic GW signal: interestingly, most of them are concentrated in the UHF band. These are produced in the early Universe and are thus subject to the cosmological constraint on the number of effective degrees of freedom during BBN and at CMB decoupling, see Sec.~\ref{sec:earlyU}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{StochasticSources_Final.pdf}

    \label{fig:hc_stochastic_summary}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
 \item In certain models, inflation (Sec.~\ref{sec:Inflation}) can yield a signal stretching over a broad frequency range (see Eq.~\eqref{eqfN}), with an amplitude determined by Eq.~\eqref{PGW-frequency} and Eq.~\eqref{nteft}, respectively.
Here in the case of inflation with extra-species we have taken the parameter $\xi$ (defined in Eq.~\eqref{PGW-frequency}) to be bounded by the perturbative limit,
and in the case of inflation described by an effective field theory with broken spatial reparametrization symmetry we have chosen the speed of sound and the spectral tilt to be $c_T = 1$ and $n_T = 0.2$, respectively. Moreover, inflation models with strongly enhanced scalar fluctuations ($P_\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2.5}) $ can source GWs with $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \lesssim 10^{-9}$ at second order in cosmological perturbation theory.
\item For preheating (Sec.~\ref{sec:Preheating}), we show typical values for models with parametric resonance in quadratic (right green box) and quartic (left green box) potentials as well as oscillons. In the latter case the frequency is set by the mass of the scalar field through Eq.~\eqref{eq:OscillonFrequency}, where here we have chosen the mass of the scalar field to be $10^{10} \ {\rm GeV} < m < 10^{13} \ {\rm GeV}$ with $X = 100$, while the amplitude is the typical value inferred from numerical simulations.
\item For the cosmic gravitational microwave background, we show the spectrum given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:CGMB} with $T_\text{max} = 10^{16}$~GeV, which is the upper bound on the reheating temperature set by the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar-ratio~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}.
\item For phase transitions (Sec.~\ref{sec:PhaseTransitions}), we assume a fixed latent heat, number of relativistic degrees of freedom and wall velocity. We also assume that sound waves do not last a Hubble time, such that the amplitude scales as the square of the inverse time scale of the transition.
The peak frequency and amplitude are then given by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:PTf} and \eqref{eq:PTOmega}, where we consider transition temperatures $T_* < 10^{16}$~GeV.
\item As an example for topological defects (Sec.~\ref{sec:TopologicalDefects}) cosmic strings lead to a broad spectrum with an amplitude given Eq.~\eqref{eq:plateauStringsNG}, where the string tension for stable cosmic strings is bounded by $G \mu < 10^{-11}$ whereas for metastable cosmic strings it can by as large as $G \mu \simeq 10^{-4}$ above the LIGO frequency range. The spectrum of gauge textures is described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:gaugetextures}, where here we have chosen the symmetry breaking scale to be $10^{12} \ {\rm GeV} < v < 10^{19}~\rm GeV$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Late Universe \label{sec:lateU}}

In this section we revise various sources that are relevant for high-frequency GW production and are active in the late Universe. A summary of these sources is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} and Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-coherent} in App.~\ref{sec:SummaryTable}.

\subsubsection{Neutron star mergers \label{sec:NS}}
For not too high binary masses the merger of two neutron stars avoids the prompt collapse to a BH and leads to the formation of a massive rapidly rotating and oscillating neutron star remnant. The oscillations of this remnant are very characteristic of the incompletely known equation of state of high-density matter and generate GW emission in the kHz range (see Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}). For instance, the dominant oscillation frequency of the post-merger phase ($f_\mathrm{peak}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}) scales tightly with the radii of non-rotating neutron stars~\cite{Bauswein2016}. These radii are uniquely determined by the equation of state of neutron stars, and are therefore particularly valuable messengers of the underlying high-density matter physics (see e.g.~\cite{Oertel2017} for a review). Simulation results show a tight correlation between the dominant GW frequency and neutron star radii; a fit to the data for fixed binary masses describes the relation with a maximum residual of only a few hundred meters, allowing for accurate radius measurements.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{merger-spectrum.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Typical GW spectrum of the cross polarization of a 1.35-1.35~$M_\odot$ merger along the polar direction at a distance of 20 Mpc. $h_\mathrm{eff,\times} = \tilde{h}_\times(f)\cdot f$ with the Fourier transform of the waveform $h_\mathrm{\times}$ and frequency $f$. $f_\mathrm{peak}$, $f_\mathrm{spiral}$ and $f_{2-0}$ are particular features of the post-merger phase, which can be associated with certain dynamical effects in the remnant. Since the simulation started only a few orbits before merging, i.e. at a relatively high orbital frequency, the power at lower frequencies (below $\sim$ 1 kHz) is massively under-represented in the shown spectrum, and the low-frequency part of the spectrum does not show the theoretically expected power-law decay. The thin solid lines display the spectra of the GW signal of the post-merger phase only revealing that the peaks are indeed generated in the post-merger phase. Dashed lines show the expected unity signal-to-noise sensitivity curves of Advanced LIGO (red) and of the Einstein Telescope (black). Figure taken from~\cite{Bauswein2016}.}
  \label{fig:spec}
\end{figure}

Subdominant features in the GW spectrum (see Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}) contain additional information about the equation of state and may also reveal the dynamics of the remnant, which is indispensable for a complete multi-messenger interpretation of neutron star mergers.
The presence or absence of post-merger GW emission from a neutron star remnant on its own informs about the outcome of the merger (neutron star or BH). In combination with the measured binary masses, this information allows to constrain the threshold binary mass for prompt BH collapse, which is somewhere in the range $(2.9 - 3.8) \, M_\odot$, depending on the equation of state. This threshold depends sensitively on the maximum mass $M_\mathrm{max}$ of non-rotating neutron stars. Obtaining the threshold mass for prompt BH formation through post-merger GW emission will yield a robust determination of the unknown maximum mass $M_\mathrm{max}$ of non-rotating neutron stars, which is another important equation of state property that probes the very high-density regime~\cite{Bauswein2013}. A robust measurement of $M_\mathrm{max}$ is also relevant for stellar astrophysics since it, for instance, affects the outcome of core-collapse supernovae. Pulsar observations only yield accurate lower bounds on $M_\mathrm{max}$.

Generally, equation of state inference from the post-merger stage is complementary to other constraints, e.g. from the inspiral phase. The complementarity concerns the probed density regime, which is generally higher in the post-merger phase, and methodological aspects. Hence, the detection of post-merger GW emission is of highest importance to understand properties of high-density matter including the opportunity to probe the presence of a phase transition to deconfined quark matter~\cite{Most2019,Bauswein2019}.

The different features of the post-merger GW emission have frequencies in the range $(1 - 5)$ kHz, with the dominant peak between 2 and 4 kHz (see Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}). Simulated injections show that at a distance of 40 Mpc (comparable to that of GW170817) a strain sensitivity of roughly {$\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 3 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$} is required for a detection of the main features~\cite{Torres-Rivas2019}. Hence, measurements can be anticipated with a small sensitivity improvement either of Advanced LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA or with a dedicated high-frequency instrument like NEMO~\cite{ozhf} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:ozgrav}).

\subsubsection{Mergers of light primordial black holes}
\label{sec:PBHmergers}

The low effective spins and progenitor masses of the BH mergers detected by LIGO/Virgo have revived the interest for primordial BHs in the range $(1-100) \, M_\odot$~\cite{Bird:2016dcv,Clesse:2016vqa,Sasaki:2016jop}, which could constitute (part of) the observed dark matter abundance. In this context, detecting a sub-solar mass BH would almost clearly point to a primordial origin.\footnote{See however~\cite{Kouvaris:2018wnh} for another sub-solar BH formation channel, in a specific dark matter scenario.}  The frequency associated to the ISCO when the inspiral GW emission is close to maximal\footnote{The ISCO characterizes the end of the inspiral phase and the beginning of the merger. The merger frequency will be higher, but we use ISCO to demonstrate the ballpark estimated strain analytically.}, is given by
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm ISCO} = 4400 \, {\rm Hz} \, \frac{M_\odot}{m_1 + m_2} \,,
\label{eq:fISCO-PBH}
\end{equation}
with $m_1$ and $m_2$ the masses of the two binary components and $M_\odot$ denoting the solar mass. A good estimation of the GW strain produced at a given frequency $f$ is provided by the Post-Newtonian approximation~\cite{Antelis:2018sfj}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:strainPBHs}
h_0 \approx \frac{2}{D} \left( \frac{G \mathcal M }{c^2}  \right)^{5/3} \left( \frac{ \pi f}{c} \right)^{2/3}  \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal M \equiv (m_1 \times m_2)^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5} $ is the binary chirp mass,  $D$ is the distance to the observer, $G$ is Newton's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. For an equal-mass binary and an experiment of strain sensitivity $h_{\rm det}$,  the corresponding astrophysical reach $D_{\rm max}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
D_{\rm max} \approx 1.6  \, \frac{(m_{\rm PBH}/M_\odot) }{h_{\rm det} \times 10^{20}} {\rm Mpc} \,.
\label{eq:h0-PBH}
\end{equation}
High-frequency GW detectors could therefore detect or set new limits on the abundance of light, sub-solar mass primordial BHs, in particular if they have an extended mass distribution. Frequencies in the range $(10^4 - 10^{12})$ Hz correspond to a primordial BH mass range $(10^{-9} - 10^{-1}) \, M_\odot$. In particular, the planetary-mass range, in which recent detections of star and quasar microlensing events~\cite{Niikura:2019kqi,Hawkins:2020zie,2019ApJ...885...77B} suggest a dark matter fraction made of primordial BHs of $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 0.01$, could be probed in a novel way.

There are two possible formation channels of primordial BH binaries, introduced hereafter:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Primordial binaries}:  they come from two primordial BHs that were formed sufficiently close to each other for their dynamics to decouple from Universe expansion before the time of matter-radiation equality~\cite{Nakamura:1997sm,Sasaki:2016jop}. The gravitational influence of one or several primordial BHs nearby prevent the two BHs to merge directly, leading to the formation of a binary.  In some cases, the binary is sufficiently stable and it takes a time of the order of the age of the Universe for the two BHs to merge. If the primordial BHs have a mass spectrum \(\rho(m)\) and are randomly distributed spatially, and that early forming primordial BH clusters do not impact the lifetime of those primordial binaries (a criterion satisfied for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 0.1 $)~\cite{Raidal:2018bbj}, then the today merging rate is approximately given by~\cite{Kocsis:2017yty,Raidal:2018bbj,Gow:2019pok}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d\tau}{d(\ln m_1) \,d(\ln m_2)} \approx \frac{1.6 \times 10^6}{\rm Gpc^3 \, yr} f_{\rm PBH}^2 \left(\frac{m_1 + m_2}{M_\odot}\right)^{-\frac{32}{37}} \left[\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right]^{-\frac{34}{37}} \rho(m_1) \rho(m_2)\,,
    \end{equation}
    where $f_{\rm PBH}$ is the integrated dark matter fraction made of primordial BHs, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two binary BHs components and $\rho(m)$ is the density distribution of primordial BHs normalized to one ($\int \rho(m) d \ln m = 1$).\footnote{However, note that if primordial BHs constitute a substantial fraction of the dark matter, then  N-body simulations have shown that early-forming clusters somehow suppress this rate, eventually down to the rates inferred by LIGO/Virgo for $f_{\rm PBH} \simeq 1$.} Assuming $f_{\rm PBH} \times \rho(m) \simeq 0.01$ at planetary masses in order to pass the microlensing limits, and considering only almost equal-mass mergers ($m_1 \sim m_2 \sim m_{\rm PBH}$) that produce the highest strain, one obtains a merging rate of
    \begin{equation}
    \tau(m_{\rm PBH}) \approx 300  \left(\frac{m_{\rm PBH}}{M_\odot}\right)^{-0.86} {\rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}}\,.
    \end{equation}
    In turn, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:strainPBHs}, one obtains the required GW strain sensitivity to detect one of these merger events per year,
    \begin{equation}
    h_{\rm max}  \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-22}  \left(\frac{m_{\rm PBH}}{M_\odot}\right)^{0.7} \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-20} \left( \frac{\rm Hz}{f} \right)^{0.7} \,,
    \end{equation}
    which can be typically targeted by GW experiments operating at frequencies from kHz up to GHz, see e.g.~\cite{Wang:2019kaf}.
    \item \textit{Capture in primordial BH haloes}:  the second binary formation channel is through dynamical capture in dense primordial BH halos. As any other dark matter candidate, primordial BHs are expected to form halos during the cosmic history.  The clustering properties typically determine the overall merging rate. For instance, for a monochromatic mass spectrum and a standard Press-Schechter halo mass function, one gets a rate~\cite{Bird:2016dcv}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:capturerate}
    \tau \sim f_{\rm PBH} \times \mathcal O(10-100) \, {\rm yr^{-1} \, Gpc}^{-3} \,,
    \end{equation}
    that is independent of the primordial BH mass. However, for realistic extended mass functions, the abundance, size and evolution of primordial BH clusters is impacted by several effects: poissonian noise, seeds from heavy primordial BHs, primordial power spectrum enhancement, dynamical heating, etc. Those can  either boost or suppress the merging rate and make it a rather complex and model-dependent process, subject to large uncertainties (see e.g.~ \cite{Clesse:2016vqa,Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Young:2019gfc,Bringmann:2018mxj,Trashorras:2020mwn} for recent studies of primordial BH clustering).  As an alternative of using uncertain theoretical predictions, one can instead infer from LIGO/Virgo observations an upper bound on the primordial BH merging rate of $\tau \approx 1.2 \times 10^4 {\rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}}$ at $m_{\rm PBH} \approx 2.5 M_\odot$~\cite{Abbott:2020uma} and of $\tau \approx 50 {\rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}} $ at masses between $ 10 M_\odot$ and $50 M_\odot$~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018jsj}. The boost in primordial BH formation at the time of the QCD transition will induce a peak at the solar mass scale in any primordial BH model with an extended mass function~\cite{Byrnes:2018clq,Carr:2019kxo}.  If one normalises the merging rates at the peak with the LIGO/Virgo rates in the solar mass range, then one obtains an upper bound on the rate distribution
    \begin{equation}  \label{eq:ratescatpure2}
    \frac{d\tau}{d(\ln m_1) d(\ln m_2)} \approx 4 \times 10^3 \times \rho(m_1) \rho(m_2) \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^{10/7}}{(m_1 m_2)^{5/7}} \rm{yr^{-1}Gpc^{-3}} \,,
    \end{equation}
    while being agnostic about the total primordial BH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Then, like for primordial binaries, one can obtain an upper limit on the merging rate for equal-mass sub-solar binaries in halos. Assuming $\rho(m_{\rm PBH}) \approx 0.01$, as suggested by microlensing surveys, one gets
    \begin{equation}
    \tau \approx 1.2 \, \rm{yr^{-1}Gpc^{-3}} \,,
    \end{equation}
    independently of the primordial BH mass. This is of the same order than the rates obtained with the theoretical prescriptions leading to Eq.~\eqref{eq:capturerate}, for a monochromatic distribution. One thus expects that Eq.~\eqref{eq:ratescatpure2} is a good approximation for a broad variety of primordial BH scenarios, for both sharp and wide mass distributions. One then obtains the required experimental strain sensitivity to detect one event per year,
    \begin{equation}
    h_{\rm max}  \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-23}  \left(\frac{m_{\rm PBH}}{M_\odot}\right) \approx 6.1 \times 10^{-20} \left( \frac{\rm Hz}{f} \right) \,.
    \end{equation}
     This GW signal is therefore typically lower than for primordial BH binaries formed in the early Universe.  However, it is still debated which of the binary formation channel is dominant, especially if $f_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 0.1$, i.e. if primordial BHs explain a significant or even the totality of the dark matter in the Universe.
\end{enumerate}
While in the literature it is often assumed for simplicity that primordial BHs have a monochromatic mass function, this is not expected in a realistic scenario. Even in the limiting case of BH formation due to a sharp peak in the primordial power spectrum, these primordial BHs would have a relatively broad distribution, due to effects related to the critical collapse~\cite{Musco:2008hv,Musco:2012au}.  For this reason and to be generic, we have also estimated in the above paragraph the rate distribution for the two possible binary formation mechanisms, without specifying the primordial BH mass function.

\subsubsection{Exotic compact objects }
\label{sec:ECOs}
Beyond the very well-known astrophysical compact objects, namely BHs and neutron stars, there are several candidates for stable (or long-lived) exotic compact objects that are composed of beyond the Standard Model particles~\cite{Giudice_2016}. For instance, they can be composed of beyond the Standard Model fermions, such as the gravitino in supergravity theories, giving rise to gravitino stars~\cite{Narain_2006}. Exotic compact objects can also be composed of bosons, such as moduli in string compactifications and supersymmetric theories~\cite{Krippendorf_2018}. Depending on the mechanism that makes the compact object stable (or long-lived), scalar field exotic compact objects have specific names such as Q-balls, boson stars, oscillatons, oscillons. There are also more exotic possibilities, such as gravastars~\cite{mazur2001gravitational}. Exotic compact objects can form binaries and emit GWs in the same way as BH and neutron star binaries do. During the early inspiral phase, the frequency of the emitted GWs is twice the orbital frequency. At the ISCO, the frequency for a binary system of two exotic compact objects with mass $M$ and radius $R$ is given by~\cite{Giudice_2016}
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm ISCO} = \frac{1}{6 \sqrt{3} \pi} \frac{C^{3/2}}{G M} \simeq C^{3/2} \left(\frac{6 \times 10^{-3} \, M_\odot}{M}\right) \, 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \,,
\label{eq:fISCO-ECO}
\end{equation}
where $C = G M/R$ is the compactness of the exotic compact object. This expression is only slightly modified for a boson star binary with two different values of the masses. Note that for a BH the radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\text{S}} = 2 G M$, therefore $C = 1/2$ is the maximum attainable value for the compactness.

The GW strain for a boson star binary formed by equal mass objects $M$ can be estimated as done in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers}
\begin{equation}
h_0 \simeq 1.72 \times 10^{-20}\, C \, \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right) \, \left(\frac{\text{Mpc}}{D}\right) \,,
\label{eq:h0-ECO}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the distance between the source and the observer. The exact waveform produced by the merger of two exotic compact objects is in general different from that of BHs and neutron stars and depends on its microphysics details~\cite{Giudice_2016, Palenzuela_2017}.\footnote{See however~\cite{Helfer:2018vtq} for more details on the initial conditions.} Hence, the detection of GWs from an exotic compact object merger would give further valuable information about beyond the Standard Model physics.

\subsubsection{Black hole superradiance}
\label{sec:Superradiance}

This section focuses on GW emission from clouds of axions or axion-like particles created by the gravitational superradiance of BHs~\cite{Ternov:1978gq,Zouros:1979iw,Arvanitaki:2009fg,Arvanitaki:2010sy,arvanitaki:2016gw,aggarwal2020searching,Detweiler:1980uk,Yoshino:2013ofa,Arvanitaki:2014wva,Brito:2014wla,Brito:2015oca}.
Superradiance is an enhanced radiation process that is associated with bosonic fields around rotating objects with dissipation. The event horizon of a spinning BH is one such example that provides conditions particularly suitable for superradiance~\cite{Arvanitaki:2014wva}.
When the axion Compton wavelength, determined by the axion mass $m_a$, is about the size of the BH,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:maMBH}
m_a \sim \left( \frac{ M_\odot}{M_{\rm BH} } \right) \, 10^{-10}\, \text{eV} \,,
\end{equation}
the axions can accumulate outside the BH event horizon and outside the ergosphere efficiently. 
The BH forms a gravitationally bound `atom' with the axions, with different atomic `levels' occupied by exponentially large numbers of axions.

The primary candidate for GWs at high-frequencies is the axion annihilation  process (${\bf a}  +  {\bf a} \rightarrow h$), with frequencies of around 100 kHz for $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim M_\odot$.The GW frequency emitted by this process is twice the Compton frequency of the axion, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsprannihilation}
f = 2 \left( \frac{m_a}{10^{-9} \, \text{eV}} \right) \, 10^{6} \, \text{Hz} \,.
\end{equation}
 The expected GW strain for this process is roughly \cite{arvanitaki:2016gw} 
\begin{equation}
    h_0 \sim 10^{-19}\left(\frac{\alpha}{l}\right)\epsilon \left(\frac{10 \, \mathrm{kpc}}{D}\right)\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{BH}}{2 M_\odot}\right) \,,
\label{eq:strain_axion_annihilation}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = G M_\mathrm{BH} \, m_a$, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum number of the axions that decay, $D$ is the distance from the observer and $\epsilon < 10^{-3}$ denotes the fraction the BH mass accumulated in the axion cloud. {The superradiance condition constrains $\alpha/l < 0.5$~\cite{Arvanitaki:2010sy}.} See Refs. \cite{Brito:2014wla,aggarwal2020searching} for more recent calculations of GW strain from BH superradiance leading to axion annihilations.

If lighter spinning BHs exist (see Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers}), then this process can produce GWs of even higher frequencies.  Note that this GW signal is predicted to be monochromatic and coherent~\cite{Arvanitaki:2014wva}, rendering it quite distinct from any other astrophysical or cosmological sources discussed here.

For heavier BHs and lighter axions, this process can produce GWs in the LIGO/VIRGO band. Additionally, these bosons created in BH superradiance may also undergo transition from one level to another, emitting a graviton in the process. Both these processes would  produce GWs of lower frequencies and could be detectable in LIGO-VIRGO and LISA, e.g. Refs.~\cite{Brito+2017,Zhu:2020tht,Tsukada:2018mbp}.

Finally, recently it has been postulated that axions might also decay into gravitons (${\bf a}\to h \, h$)~\cite{Sun:2020gem}. In such a process, the GW frequency would be half of the axion Compton frequency, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsprdecay}
f = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{m_a}{10^{-9} \, \text{eV}} \right) \, 10^{6} \, \text{Hz} \,.
\end{equation}
The corresponding strain of the coherent signal has been calculated in Ref.~\cite{Sun:2020gem} to be
\begin{align}\label{GWhg1}
  h_0  \sim 10^{-24} \left(\frac{1 \, \text{MHz}}{f}\right)  \left(\frac{\epsilon \, M_\text{BH}}{ 10^{-7} M_{\odot}} \right)^{1/2} \left(\frac{10 \, \text{kpc}}{D}\right) \,,
     \end{align}
where $\epsilon < 10^{-3}$ denotes the fraction the BH mass accumulated in the axion cloud.

\subsection{Early Universe \label{sec:earlyU} }

We now turn to cosmological sources emitting GWs at cosmological distances, i.e.\ in the early Universe. For a summary of these sources see Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} and Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-stochastic} in App.~\ref{sec:SummaryTable}. In this case, the source is associated to an event in our cosmological history, triggered e.g.\ by the decreasing temperature $T$ of the thermal bath, and typically occurs everywhere in the Universe at (approximately) the same time. This results in a stochastic background of GWs which is a superposition of GWs with different wave vectors. The total energy density of a GW background $\rho_{\rm GW} \equiv \int d\log k \left(d\rho_{\rm GW} / d\log k\right)$, with characteristic wavelengths well inside the horizon, decays as relativistic degrees of freedom with the expansion of the Universe, i.e.~as $\rho_{\rm GW}\propto a^{-4}$. This implies that a GW background acts as an additional radiation field contributing to the background expansion rate of the Universe. Observables that can probe the background evolution of the Universe at some particular moment of its history, can therefore be used to constrain $\rho_{\rm GW}$ at such moments. In particular, two events in cosmic history yield a precise measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe: BBN and photon decoupling of the CMB. An upper bound on the total energy density of a GW background present at the time of BBN and CMB decoupling can be therefore derived from the constraint on the amount of radiation tolerated at those cosmic epochs, when the Universe had a temperature of $T_{\rm BBN} \sim 0.1$ MeV and $T_{\rm CMB} \sim 0.3$ eV, respectively.

A constraint on the presence of `extra' radiation is usually expressed in terms of an effective number of neutrinos species $N_{\rm eff}$ after electron-positron annihilation. After electron-positron annihilation, the total number of Standard Model relativistic degrees of freedom was $g_*(T < T_{e^+e^-}) = 2 + \frac{7}{4}\,N_{\rm eff} \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3}$, with $N_{\rm eff}=3.046$. As the radiation energy density for thermal degrees of freedom in the Universe is given by $\rho_{\rm rad} = \frac{\pi^2}{30}g_{*}(T)T^4$, an extra amount of radiation can be parametrized by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ extra neutrino species\footnote{This is independent of whether the extra radiation is in a thermal state or not, as this is only a parametrization of the total energy density of the extra component, independently of its spectrum.}, as $\Delta \rho_\mathrm{rad} =  \frac{\pi^2}{30}\, \frac{7}{4}\, \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3} \Delta N_{\rm eff} \, T^4$. An upper bound on the extra radiation can thus be seen as an upper bound on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Since the energy density in GW must satisfy $\rho_{\rm GW}(T) \leq \Delta \rho_\mathrm{rad}(T)$, we obtain $\left(\frac{\rho_\mathrm{GW}}{\rho_{\gamma}}\right)_{T = \mathrm{MeV}} \leq \frac{7}{8}\, \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3} \Delta N_{\rm eff}$, with $\rho_\gamma$ denoting the energy density in photons. Writing the fraction of GW energy density today\footnote{{We write the current value of the Hubble parameter as $H_0 = h_H \times 100 \, \text{km} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Early Universe and late time observations report slightly different values for $h_H$, see~\cite{Bernal:2016gxb} for a discussion. For all our purposes, we will assume $h_H = 0.7$ when needed.}} as $\left(\frac{\rho_{\rm GW} \, h_H^2}{\rho_c}\right)_0 = \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \, h_H^2 \, \left(\frac{g_S(T_0)}{g_S(T)}\right)^{4/3}\frac{\rho_{\rm GW}(T)}{\rho_\gamma(T)}$, we obtain a constraint on the redshifted GW energy density today, in terms of the number of extra neutrino species~\cite{Caprini:2018mtu}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ConsRhoBBN}
\left(\frac{\rho_{\rm GW} \, h_H^2}{\rho_c}\right)_0 \leq  \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \, h_H^2 \times \frac{7}{8}\, \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3} \Delta N_{\rm eff}= 5.6 \times 10^{-6} \,
\Delta N_{\rm eff}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have inserted $\Omega_{\text{rad},0} \, h_H^2 = \left(\rho_{\gamma}/\rho_c\right)_0 \, h_H^2 = 2.47 \times 10^{-5}$.
We recall that the above bound applies only to the total GW energy density, integrated over wavelengths way inside the Hubble radius (for super-horizon wavelengths, tensor modes do not propagate as a wave, and hence they do not affect the expansion rate of the Universe). Except for GW spectra with a very narrow peak of width $\Delta f \ll f$, the bound can be interpreted as a bound on the amplitude of a GW spectrum, $\Omega_{\text{GW},0}(f) \, h_H^2 \lesssim 5.6 \times 10^{-6} \Delta N_{\rm eff}$, over a wide frequency range.  The bound obviously applies only to GW backgrounds that are present before the physical mechanism (BBN or CMB decoupling) considered to infer the constraint on $N_{\rm eff}$ takes place.

Constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ can be placed by BBN alone, and/or in combinations with CMB data. In particular, Ref.~\cite{Cyburt:2015mya} finds $\Delta N_{\rm eff} < 0.2$ at 95\% confidence level. Eq.~\eqref{eq:ConsRhoBBN} then gives
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:BBNbound}
\left(\frac{\rho_{\rm GW} \, h_H^2}{\rho_c}\right)_0 < 1.12 \times 10^{-6}\,,
\label{eq:BBN}
\end{eqnarray}
for a stochastic GW background produced before BBN, with wavelengths inside the Hubble radius at the onset of BBN, corresponding to present-day frequencies $f \geq 1.5 \times 10^{-12}$ Hz.
%
A similar bound can also be obtained from constraints on the Hubble rate at CMB decoupling~\cite{Smith:2006nka,Sendra:2012wh,Pagano:2015hma, Clarke:2020bil}. This translates into an upper bound on the amount of GWs, which extends to a greater frequency range than the BBN bound, down to $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$ Hz.

Since high-frequency GWs carry a lot of energy, $\Omega_\text{GW} \propto f^3 \, S_h$, these bounds pose severe constraints on possible cosmological sources of high-frequency GWs.


\subsubsection{Inflation}
\label{sec:Inflation}
Under the standard assumption of scale invariance, the amplitude of the GWs produced during inflation is too small ($\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \lesssim 10^{-16}$) to be observable with current technology.\footnote{However, note that the proposed space-borne detectors Big Bang Observer (BBO)~\cite{BBO} and DECI hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO)~\cite{Seto:2001qf} may reach the necessary sensitivity, assuming that astrophysical GW foregrounds will be able to be substracted to this accuracy}.

Various inflationary mechanisms have been studied in the literature that can produce a significantly blue-tilted GW signal (i.e.\ increasing towards higher frequency), or a localized bump at some given (momentum) scale, with a potentially visible amplitude. A number of these mechanisms have been explored in~\cite{Bartolo:2016ami} with a focus on the LISA experiment, and therefore on a GW signal in the mHz range. However, these mechanisms can be easily extended to higher frequencies. Assuming an approximately constant Hubble $H$ parameter during inflation, a GW generated $N$ Hubble times (e-folds) before the end of inflation with frequency $H$ is redshifted to frequency $f$ today, with
%
\begin{equation}
\ln \left[\frac{f}{10^{-18} {\rm Hz}}\right] \simeq N_{\rm CMB}-N \,,
\label{eqfN}
\end{equation}
%
where $ N_{\rm CMB}$ is the number of e-folds at which the CMB modes exited the horizon. The numerical value of $N_{\rm CMB}$ depends logarithmically on the energy scale of inflation, which is bounded from above by the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}, $H \lesssim 6 \times 10^{13}$~GeV. Saturating this bounds implies $N_{\rm CMB} \simeq 60$, and a peak at $f = 1 \; {\rm MHz}$ then corresponds to the $N = 4.7$, while the LIGO frequency $f_{\rm LIGO} = {\mathcal{O}} \left( 10^2 \, {\rm Hz} \right)$ corresponds to about $N = 14$. Such late stages of inflation are not accessible by electromagnetic probes.

Ref.~\cite{Bartolo:2016ami} discusses three broad categories: the presence of extra fields that are amplified in the later stages of inflation (so to affect only scales much smaller than the CMB ones); GW production in the effective field theory framework of broken spatial reparametrizations and GWs sourced by (large) scalar perturbations.
%
In the following we will briefly summarize these three cases.


\paragraph{Extra-species}
Several mechanisms of particle production during inflation, with a consequent GW amplification, have been considered in the recent literature. Here, for definiteness, we discuss a specific mechanism in which a pseudo-scalar inflation $\phi$ produces gauge fields via an axionic coupling $\frac{\phi }{4 f_a} F {\tilde F}$,  where $F_{\mu \nu}$ is the gauge field strength,  ${\tilde F}_{\mu \nu}$ its dual, and $f_a$ is the axion decay constant. The motion of the inflaton results in a large amplification of one of the two gauge field helicities. The produced gauge quanta in turn generate inflaton perturbations and GW via $2 \to 1$ processes~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf,Sorbo:2011rz}. In particular, the spectrum of the sourced GWs is~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf}
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \simeq 3.6 \cdot 10^{-9} \, \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \frac{H^4}{M_p^4} \, \frac{{\rm e}^{4 \pi \xi}}{\xi^6}\,, \qquad
\xi \equiv \frac{\dot{\phi}}{2 f_a H} \,,
\label{PGW-frequency}
%\label{PGW-sourced}
\end{equation}
%
where $H$ is the Hubble rate. In this relation, $H$ and $\dot{\phi}$ are evaluated when a given mode exits the horizon, and therefore the spectrum in Eq.~\eqref{PGW-frequency} is in general scale-dependent. In particular, in the $\xi \gg 1$ regime, the GW amplitude grows exponentially with  the speed of the inflaton, which in turn typically increases over the course of inflation in single-field inflation models. As a consequence, the spectrum in Eq.~\eqref{PGW-frequency} is naturally blue. The growth of $\xi$ is limited by the backreaction of the gauge fields on the inflaton. {Within the limits of a perturbative description, $\xi \lesssim 4.7$~\cite{Peloso:2016gqs}, GW amplitudes of $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \simeq 10^{-10}$ can be obtained.} Refs.~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh,Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw} explored the resulting spectrum for several inflaton potentials. In particular hill-top potentials are characterized by a very small speed close to the top (that is mapped to the early stages of observable inflation), and by a sudden increase of the speed at the very end of inflation. Interestingly, hill-top type potentials are naturally present~\cite{Peloso:2015dsa} in models of multiple axions such as aligned axion inflation~\cite{Kim:2004rp}.
%

\paragraph{Effective field theory spatial reparametrizations}
The modification of  the theory of gravity which underlines the inflationary physics can give rise to an extra production of GWs with a large amplitude (and blue tilt) rendering it accessible to high-frequency GW experiments. From the theoretical point of view, the effective field theory approach~\cite{Cheung:2007st} represents a powerful tool to provide a clear description of the relevant degrees of freedom at the energy scale of interest exploiting the power of symmetries and gives an accurate prediction of observational quantities.
In the standard single-field effective field theory of inflation ~\cite{Cheung:2007st} only time-translation symmetry ($t\rightarrow t+\xi_{0}$) is broken according to the cosmological background expansion during inflation. However when space-reparameterization symmetry  ($x_{i}\rightarrow x_{i}+\xi_{i}$) is also broken~\cite{Bartolo:2015qvr,Graef:2015ova}, scalar and tensors (GWs) acquire interesting features. In particular tensors can acquire a non-trivial mass $m_h$ and sound speed $c_T$, making them potential targets for high-frequency detectors since in this case the spectrum gets enhanced on small scales. At the quadratic level in perturbations, in an effective field theory approach, the action for graviton fluctuations $h_{ij}$ around a conformally flat
Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker background can be expressed
as in~\cite{Cannone:2014uqa, Bartolo:2015qvr,Ricciardone:2016lym}:
%
\begin{equation} \label{sol-qac}
\mathcal{L}_{h}=\frac{M_p^2}{8}\,\left[\dot h_{ij}^2 -\frac{c_T^2(t)}{a^2} \,\left( \partial_l h_{ij}\right)^2
-m_h^2(t)\,h_{ij}^2\right]\,.
\end{equation}
%
The corresponding tensor power spectrum and its related spectral tilt are:
\begin{equation}
{\cal P}_T\,=\,\frac{2\,H^2}{\pi^2\,M_p^2\,c_T^3}\,\left( \frac{k}{k_*}\right)^{n_T}\,,\quad \quad\quad \quad n_T\,=\,-2 \epsilon+\frac{2}{3}
\frac{m_{h}^2}{H^2}\,.
\label{nteft}
\end{equation}
Hence, if the quantity $m_{h}/H$ is sufficiently large,  we can get a blue tensor spectrum with no need to violate the null energy condition in the early Universe. Consequently $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim \Omega_{\text{rad},0} {\cal P}_T$ is enhanced at high-frequencies, making it a potential target for high-frequency GW detectors. The upper bound at on the spectrum at high-frequencies is set by the observational BBN and CMB bounds, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:BBN}. This scenario shows how GW detectors at high-frequency might be useful to test the modification of gravity at very high-energy scales.

\paragraph{Second-order GW production from primordial scalar fluctuations}
In homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds, scalar, vector and tensor fluctuation modes decouple from each other at first order in perturbation theory. These modes can however source each other non-linearly, starting from second order. In particular, density perturbations can produce  `induced' (or `secondary') GWs through a $\zeta+\zeta \to h$ process \cite{Mollerach:2003nq,Ananda:2006af,Baumann:2007zm} (see also \cite{Kohri:2018awv,Espinosa:2018eve, Braglia:2020eai}). This production, which simply involves only gravity, is mostly effective when the modes re-enter the horizon after inflation. (Second order GWs are also produced in an early matter era, \cite{Inomata:2019ivs,Inomata:2019zqy})
The amplitude of this signal is quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and scale-invariant ${\mathcal{O}} \left( 10^{-5} \right)$  perturbations, as measured on large scales by the CMB, result in unobservable GWs due to too small amplitude. On the other hand, if the spectrum of scalar perturbations produced during inflation has a localized bump at some given scale (significantly smaller than the scales of CMB and the large scale structure), as required e.g.\ to obtain a sizable primordial BH abundance of some specific given mass, the height of the bump could be sufficiently high to produce a noticeable amount of GWs~\cite{Inomata:2016rbd,Garcia-Bellido:2017aan,Bartolo:2018rku}. The non-detection of the stochastic GW background can also be used to constrain fluctuations \cite{Byrnes:2018txb,Inomata:2018epa}. The induced GWs have a frequency $f_*$ parametrically equal to the momentum $k_*$ and can hence be related to the e-fold $N$ of horizon exit of the scalar perturbation through Eq.~\eqref{eqfN}.

The precise amount of produced GWs depends on the statistics of the scalar perturbations~\cite{Nakama:2016gzw,Garcia-Bellido:2017aan,Cai:2018dig,Unal:2018yaa}. A reasonable estimate is however obtained by simply looking at the scalar two-point function,
%
\begin{equation}
P_{h}^{\rm ind}  \propto \langle h^2 \rangle  \propto \langle \zeta^4 \rangle \propto P_\zeta^2 \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $P_\zeta$ is the power spectrum (two-point function) of the gauge invariant scalar density fluctuations such that $\langle \zeta_{\bf k} \, \zeta_{\bf k'} \rangle \propto  \frac{\delta ({\bf k+k'})}{k^3} \, P_\zeta (k)$. From this relation, the present value of the induced stochastic GW background is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim  \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \,  P_\zeta^2 \,.
\end{equation}

At the largest scales of our observable Universe, the density fluctuations are measured as $P_\zeta \simeq 2 \cdot 10^{-9}$, resulting in $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim  {\cal O}(10^{-22})$. Primordial BH limits are compatible with $P_\zeta$ as large as $\lesssim 10^{-2.5}$ at some (momentum) scale $k_*$, in which case $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim  {\cal O} (10^{-9})$.

\subsubsection{(P)reheating}
\label{sec:Preheating}

Preheating is an out-of-equilibrium production of particles due to non-perturbative effects \cite{Traschen:1990sw,Kofman:1994rk,Shtanov:1994ce,Kaiser:1995fb,Khlebnikov:1996mc,Prokopec:1996rr,Kaiser:1997mp,Kofman:1997yn,Greene:1997fu,Kaiser:1997hg}, which takes place after inflation in many models of particle physics (see \cite{Allahverdi:2010xz,Amin:2014eta,Lozanov:2019jxc} for reviews).  After inflation, the interactions between the different fields may generate non-adiabatic time-dependent terms in the field equations of motion, which can give rise to an exponential growth of the field modes within certain bands of momenta. The field gradients generated during this stage can be an important source of primordial GWs, with the specific features of the GW spectra depending strongly on the considered scenario, see e.g.~\cite{Khlebnikov:1997di,GarciaBellido:1998gm,Easther:2006gt,Easther:2006vd,GarciaBellido:2007dg,GarciaBellido:2007af,Dufaux:2007pt,Dufaux:2008dn,Figueroa:2011ye}. If instabilities are caused by the field's own self-interactions, we refer to it as \textit{self-resonance}, a scenario which will be discussed in more detail below. Here we consider instead a multi-field preheating scenario, in which a significant fraction of energy is successfully transferred from the inflationary sector to other fields.

For illustrative process, let us consider a two-field scenario, in which the post-inflationary oscillations of the inflaton excite a secondary massless species. More specifically, let us consider an inflaton with power-law potential $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{p} \lambda \mu^{4-p} |\phi|^p$, where $\lambda$ is a dimensionless coefficient, $\mu$ is a mass scale, and $p\geq 2$. Let us also define $t_{\star}$ as the time when inflation ends. For $t \gtrsim t_{\star}$, the inflaton oscillates with time-dependent frequency $\Omega_{\rm osc} \equiv \omega_{\star} (t /t_{\star})^{1- 2/p}$, where $\omega_{\star} \equiv \sqrt{\lambda} \mu^{(2 - p/2)} \phi_{\star}^{(p/2 - 1)}$ and $\phi_{\star} \equiv \phi (t_{\star})$ \cite{Turner:1983he}. Let us now include a quadratic interaction term $g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2$ between the inflaton and a secondary massless scalar field $\chi$, where $g$ is a dimensionless coupling constant. In this case, the driving post-inflationary particle production mechanism is parametric resonance \cite{Kofman:1994rk,Kofman:1997yn,Greene:1997fu}. In particular, if the so-called \textit{resonance parameter} $q_{\star} \equiv g^2 \phi_{\star}^2 /\omega_{\star}^2$ obeys $q_{\star} \gtrsim 1$, the secondary field gets excited through a process of broad resonance, and the amplitude of the field modes grows exponentially inside a Bose-sphere of radius $k \lesssim k_{\star} \sim q_*^{1/4} \omega_{\star}$. The GW spectrum produced during this process has a peak at approximately the frequency and amplitude \cite{Figueroa:2017vfa},
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{gather}
        f \simeq  8 \cdot 10^{9} \left( \frac{\omega_{\star}}{{\rho}_{\star}^{1/4}}\right)\, \epsilon_{\star}^{\frac{1}{4}} q_{\star}^{\frac{1}{4} + \eta}~{\rm Hz} \label{eq:preheating-1} \,,\\
        \Omega_{\text{GW},0}(f) \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-9}) \times \epsilon_{\star} \, \mathcal{C} \frac{\omega_{\star}^{6}}{\rho_{\star} M_p^{2}}\,q_{\star}^{-\frac{1}{2}+\delta} \label{eq:preheating-2} \,,
    \end{gather}
\end{subequations}
where $\rho_{\star}$ is the energy density at time $t=t_{\star}$, $\eta$ and $\delta$ are two parameters that account for non-linear effects, and $\mathcal{C}$ is a constant that characterizes the strength of the resonance. The factor $\epsilon_{\star} \equiv (a_{\star} /a_{\rm RD})^{1 - 3 w}$ parametrizes the period between the end of inflation and the onset of the radiation dominated stage with a transitory effective equation of state $w$. If non-linear effects are ignored, the frequency and amplitude scale as $f \sim q_{\star}^{1/4}$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim q_{\star}^{-1/2}$ respectively.

The values for $\mathcal{C}$, $\eta$, and $\delta$, can be determined for specific preheating models with classical lattice simulations. For chaotic inflation with quadratic potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^2$, one finds a frequency in the range $f \simeq (10^8 - 10^9) \, {\rm Hz}$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \simeq (10^{-12} - 10^{-11})$ for resonance parameters $q_{\star} \in (10^4,10^6)$ (assuming $\epsilon_{\star} = 1$). On the other hand, for the quartic potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^4$, one gets $f \simeq (10^7 - 10^8)  \,  {\rm Hz}$  and $\Omega_{\text{GW}, 0} \simeq (10^{-13} - 10^{-11}) $ in the range $q_{\star} \in (1,10^4)$. The GW spectrum in the quartic case also features additional peaks, see~\cite{Figueroa:2017vfa} for more details.

GWs can also be strongly produced if the species of the fields involved is different, or when the resonant phenomena driving preheating is different than parametric resonance. For example, GWs can be produced during the out-of-equilibrium excitation of fermions after inflation, for both spin-1/2 \cite{Enqvist:2012im,Figueroa:2013vif,Figueroa:2014aya} and spin-3/2 \cite{Benakli:2018xdi} fields. Similarly, GWs can also be generated when the decay products are (Abelian and non-Abelian) gauge fields. For example, the gauge fields can be coupled to a complex scalar field via a covariant derivative like in \cite{Dufaux:2010cf,Figueroa:2016ojl,Tranberg:2017lrx}, or to a pseudo-scalar field via an axial coupling as in~\cite{Adshead:2018doq,Adshead:2019igv,Adshead:2019lbr}. Preheating can be remarkably efficient in the second case, and the GW amplitude can scale up to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim \mathcal{O} \left(10^{-6} - 10^{-7}\right)$ for certain coupling strengths, see \cite{Adshead:2019igv,Adshead:2019lbr} for more details. Production of GWs during preheating with non-minimal couplings to the scalar curvature has also been explored in \cite{Fu:2017ero}. Finally, the stochastic background of GWs from preheating may develop anisotropies if the inflaton is coupled to a secondary light scalar field, see \cite{Bethke:2013aba, Bethke:2013vca}.


\paragraph{Oscillon Production.}

Oscillons are long-lived compact objects~\cite{Gleiser:1993pt} that can be formed in the early Universe in a variety of post-inflationary scenarios which involve a preheating-like phase~\cite{Amin:2010jq, Amin:2010dc, Amin:2011hj, Zhou:2013tsa, Amin:2013ika, Lozanov:2014zfa, Antusch:2015vna, Antusch:2015ziz, Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz, Antusch:2017vga, Lozanov:2017hjm, Amin:2018xfe, Antusch:2019qrr, Sang:2019ndv, Lozanov:2019ylm, Fodor:2019ftc, Hiramatsu:2020obh}. Their dynamics is a possible source of GW production. Oscillons are pseudo-solitonic solutions of real scalar field theories: their existence is due to attractive self-interactions of the scalar field that balance the outward pressure.\footnote{If the scalar field is complex and the potential features a global $U(1)$ symmetry, non-topological solitons like Q-balls~\cite{Coleman:1985ki} can be formed during the post-inflationary stage, giving rise to  similar GW signatures~\cite{Chiba:2009zu}.} The real scalar field self-interactions are attractive if the scalar potential is shallower than quadratic at least on one side with respect to the minimum. Oscillons can be thought off as bubbles in which the scalar field is undergoing large oscillations that probe the non-linear part of the potential, while outside the scalar field is oscillating with a very small amplitude around the minimum of the potential.

As discussed in the previous section, during preheating the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field are amplified due to a resonance process. The Universe ends up in a very inhomogeneous phase in which the inflaton (or any other scalar field that produces preheating) is fragmented and there are large fluctuations in the energy density. At this point, if the field is subject to attractive self-interactions, the inhomogeneities can clump and form oscillons. While clumping oscillons deviate significantly from being spherically symmetric, therefore their dynamics produce GWs. After many oscillations of the scalar field they tend to become spherically symmetric and GW production stops. However, during their entire lifetime oscillons can produce GWs also due to the interactions and collisions among each other~\cite{Helfer:2018vtq}. Oscillons are very long-lived: their lifetime is model-dependent but typically $\gtrsim 10^4 /m$~\cite{Gleiser:2008ty, Amin:2010jq, Amin:2010dc, Amin:2011hj, Salmi:2012ta, Saffin:2014yka, Antusch:2019qrr, Gleiser:2019rvw, Zhang:2020bec}, where $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. Oscillons eventually decay through classical~\cite{Segur:1987mg} or quantum radiation~\cite{Hertzberg:2010yz}.

The peak of the GW spectrum at production is centered slightly below the value of the mass of the field, that typically correspond to a frequency today well above the LIGO range\footnote{See however~\cite{Antusch:2016con, Liu:2017hua, Kitajima:2018zco} for models that lead to a GW peak at lower frequencies.}~\cite{Zhou:2013tsa, Antusch:2017flz, Lozanov:2019ylm}. In a typical situation, an oscillating massive scalar field forming oscillons quickly comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe until the perturbative decay of the field itself. For the simplest case of a gravitationally coupled massive field that starts oscillating at $H \simeq m$ and decays at $H \sim m^3/M_p^2$) the frequency today can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OscillonFrequency}
f \simeq X \left(\frac{m}{10^{12} \, \text{GeV}}\right)^{5/6} \, 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \,,
\end{equation}
where the factor $X$ which is typically in the range $X \simeq (10-10^3)$ is due to the unknown precise time of GW production and can be obtained in concrete models through lattice simulations: the equality would hold if GWs were produced immediately when the scalar field starts oscillating.\footnote{This rough estimate assumes that the field starts oscillating when $H \simeq m$. Since the potential contains self-interactions, assuming that the field starts at rest, the actual requirement for the start of the oscillations is $V''(\phi_{\text{in}}) \sim H$, where $\phi_{\rm in}$ is the initial value of the field. Please note that if the field is the inflaton, the initial conditions are different from those assumed in Eq.~\eqref{eq:OscillonFrequency} and therefore this estimate does not necessarily hold, see e.g.~\cite{Antusch:2016con}.} On the other hand, the later GWs are produced, the less the frequency is red-shifted and the larger is $X$. The maximum value of today's amplitude for these processes, inferred from numerical simulations, is in the range $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \simeq (10^{-13} - 10^{-10})$~\cite{Antusch:2016con, Antusch:2017flz, Amin:2018xfe}, see~\cite{Dufaux:2007pt} for a discussion on how to compute the GW amplitude.

Depending on the model, gravitational effects can become important and play a crucial role for the existence/stability of the solution~\cite{Seidel:1991zh}. In particular the requirement that the potential must be shallower than quadratic is no longer necessary, as the attractive force is provided by gravity~\cite{UrenaLopez:2002gx}. In this case oscillons are equivalent to oscillatons, see Sec.~\ref{sec:ECOs}, and can give rise to interesting additional effects, such as the collapse to BHs~\cite{Muia:2019coe, Giblin:2019nuv, Kou:2019bbc, Nazari:2020fmk}.

\subsubsection{Cosmic gravitational microwave background}
\label{sec:CGMB}

The hot thermal plasma of the early Universe acts as a source of GWs, which, similarly to the relic photons of the CMB, peak in the $\sim 100$~GHz range today. The spectrum of this signal is determined by the particle content and the maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$ reached by the thermal plasma in the Universe history~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa, Ghiglieri:2020mhm, Ringwald:2020ist}. Ignoring the dependence on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, the energy density in GWs per logarithmic frequency interval can then be written as
 \begin{align}
\Omega_{\rm GW,0}(f) \simeq \frac{1440 	\sqrt{10}}{2 \pi^2} \Omega_{{\rm rad}, 0} \frac{f^3}{T_0^3} \frac{T_{\rm max}}{M_p} \hat{\eta} \left(T_{\rm max}, 2 \pi f/T_0\right)\,,
  \label{eq:CGMB}
 \end{align}
where $T_0$ is the temperature of the CMB today, while $\hat{\eta}(T_{\rm max}, 2 \pi f/T_0)$ encodes the sources of GW production in the thermal plasma: it is dominated by long range hydrodynamic fluctuations at $2 \pi f<T_0$ and by quasi-particle excitations in the plasma at $2 \pi f \sim T_0$, see~\cite{Ghiglieri:2015nfa, Ghiglieri:2020mhm, Ringwald:2020ist} for more details. The peak frequency of $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0}(f)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:CGMB} is in the $(1-100) \, \rm GHz$ range today and depends on the number of entropic relativistic degrees of freedom $g_{*s}(T = T_{\rm max})$.
The peak of $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0}(f)$ approaches the BBN bound if $T_\text{max} \sim M_p$. The CMB constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio however constrain the maximal reheating temperature to $T_\text{max} < 10^{16}$~GeV~\cite{Akrami:2018odb} under the assumption of slow-roll inflation and instantaneous reheating. Therefore the detection of the cosmic gravitational microwave background corresponding to $T_{\rm max} > 10^{16} \, \rm{GeV}$ would rule out slow-roll inflation as a viable pre hot Big Bang scenario. Note that since at leading order $\Omega_{\rm GW,0}(f)$ scales linearly with $T_{\rm max}$ and the peak frequency depends on $g_{*s}(T_{\rm max})$, the detection of the peak of the cosmic gravitational microwave background would determine both $T_{\rm max}$ and $g_{*s}(T_{\rm max})$, see~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} for more details.

\subsubsection{Phase transitions}
\label{sec:PhaseTransitions}

A first order phase transition in the early Universe proceeds by the nucleation of bubbles of the low-temperature phase as the Universe cools below the critical temperature~\cite{Steinhardt:1981ct,Hogan:1984hx}.  Due to the higher pressure inside, the bubbles expand and collide, and the stable phase takes over.  The process disturbs the fluid, generating shear stresses and hence GWs~\cite{Witten:1984rs,Hogan:1986qda}. As the perturbations are mostly compression waves, they can be described as sound waves, and
their collisions are the main source of GWs~\cite{Hindmarsh:2013xza,Hindmarsh:2015qta,Hindmarsh:2017gnf}. \par
The peak frequency of an acoustic contribution to a relic GW background from a strong first order transition is controlled by the temperature of the transition $T_{\ast}$, and the mean bubble separation $R_*$.\footnote{The subscript $*$ means that the corresponding quantity is evaluated at the bubble nucleation time.} Numerical simulations show for wall speeds not too close to the speed of sound that~\cite{Hindmarsh:2017gnf}
\begin{equation}
    f \simeq 26 \left( \frac{1}{H _\ast R _\ast} \right)
\left(  \frac{T_{\ast} }{10^5 \, \text{GeV}} \right) \left( \frac{g_\ast (T_\ast)}{100 } \right)^{1/6}   \text{mHz} \,,
\label{eq:PTf}
\end{equation}
where $H_\ast$ is the Hubble rate at nucleation. The theoretical expectation is that $1 \lesssim (H _\ast R _\ast )^{-1} \lesssim 10^4$.
The intensity depends on $H_\ast R_\ast$, on the fraction of the energy density of the Universe which is converted into kinetic energy $K$ and on the lifetime of the source, which can last for up to a Hubble time.
Denoting the lifetime of the velocity perturbations by $\tau _{\rm v}$, the peak GW amplitude can be estimated as \cite{Hindmarsh:2015qta,Guo:2020grp}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \simeq 3 \,(H _\ast  R _\ast) \, \left(1- \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+2 H_\ast \tau_{\rm v}}}\right) \left( \frac{100}{g_\ast (T_\ast)} \right)^{1/3} \, K^2 \, \tilde\Omega_\text{GW} \, \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \,,
\label{eq:PTOmega}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde\Omega_\text{GW} $ is a simulation factor and $\tau _{\rm v} = R_\ast /\sqrt{K}$ is the life time of the sound waves. Numerical simulations indicate $\tilde\Omega_\text{GW} = \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-2}\right).$
Hence, $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \lesssim 10^{-7}$ today, with the upper bound reached only if most of the energy available in the phase transition
is turned into kinetic energy.  This is only possible if there is significant supercooling. \par
The calculation of the kinetic energy fraction and the mean bubble separation requires a knowledge of the free energy density $f(T,\phi)$, a function of the temperature and the scalar field (or fields) $\phi$ whose expectation value determines the phase. If the underlying quantum theory is weakly coupled, and the scalar particle corresponding to $\phi$ is light compared to the masses gained by gauge bosons in the phase transition, this is easily calculated, and shows that first order transitions are generic in gauge theories in this limit \cite{Kirzhnits:1972iw,Kirzhnits:1976ts}, meaning that there is a temperature range in which there are two minima of the free energy as a function of $\phi$.  The critical temperature is defined as the temperature at which the two minima are degenerate, separated by a local maximum. \par

The key parameters to be extracted from the underlying theory, besides the critical temperature $T_c$, are the nucleation rate $\beta$, the strength parameter $\alpha$ and the bubble wall speed $v_w$. The nucleation rate parameter $\beta = d \log p/dt$, where $p$ is the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume, is calculable from $f(T,\phi)$ through an application of homogeneous nucleation theory \cite{Langer:1969bc} to high-temperature fields \cite{Linde:1981zj}.
This calculation also gives $T_\ast $ as the temperature at which the volume-averaged bubble nucleation rate peaks.
The strength parameter is roughly, but not precisely, one quarter of the latent heat divided by the thermal energy (see~\cite{Hindmarsh:2019phv} for a more precise definition) at the nucleation temperature, and  also follows from knowing  $f(T,\phi)$.
The wall speed is a non-equilibrium quantity, which cannot be extracted from the free energy alone, and is rather difficult to calculate accurately (see \cite{Dorsch:2018pat, Laurent:2020gpg} and references therein). In terms of these parameters, it can be shown that \cite{Enqvist:1991xw} $ R_\ast \sim  v_w/\beta  \,.$
The kinetic energy fraction $K$, can be estimated from the self-similar hydrodynamic flow set up around an isolated expanding bubble, whose solution can be found as a function of the latent heat and bubble wall velocity by  a simple one-dimensional integration~\cite{Turner:1992tz,Espinosa:2010hh,Hindmarsh:2019phv}\footnote{Approximate fits can be found in \cite{Espinosa:2010hh}.} and typically ranges between $K = 1-10^{-6}$. \par

Current projected sensitivities for the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer can probe a cosmological first order transition occurring at a temperature that is at most a few hundred TeV assuming a modest amount of supercooling \cite{Evans:2016mbw,Punturo:2010zz,Hild:2010id} (i.e.\ when $T_\ast \sim T_C$ and $(R_\ast H_\ast )^{-1} \gtrsim 100$). Recently there has been much interest in high scale transitions motivated by U(1)$_{B-L}$ breaking for leptogenesis and the seesaw scenario \cite{Jinno:2016knw,Marzo:2018nov,Brdar:2018num,Okada:2018xdh,Hasegawa:2019amx,Okada:2020vvb}, as well as multi-step grand unification breaking patterns such as a Pati-Salam model \cite{Croon:2018kqn,Greljo:2019xan,Brdar:2019fur,Huang:2020bbe}. However, in both cases it is more natural to motivate significantly higher scale transitions and to most naturally probe first order transitions at these scales one requires a detector sensitive to frequencies in the range $f \simeq (10^{-3} - 10^3)$ GHz. Finally, it has been shown that zero-temperature phase transitions are likely to occurr in string models that include warped throats~\cite{GarciaGarcia:2016xgv}. These lead to a GW spectrum whose peak falls in the high-frequency range for small values of the compactification volume and large values of the gravitational warp factor associated with the throat in which the phase transition occurs. \par

\subsubsection{Topological defects }
\label{sec:TopologicalDefects}

Cosmic strings are one-dimensional topological defect solutions which may have formed after a phase transitions in the early Universe, if the first homotopy group of the vacuum manifold associated with the symmetry breaking is non-trivial~\cite{Kibble:1976sj,Jeannerot:2003qv}. They can also be fundamental strings from string theory, formed for instance at the end of brane inflation~\cite{Dvali:2003zj,Copeland:2003bj}, and stretched to cosmological scales. The energy per unit length of a string is $\mu \sim \eta^2$, with $\eta$ the characteristic energy scale (in the case of topological strings, it is the energy scale of the phase transition). Typically, the tension of the strings is characterized by the dimensionless combination $G\mu \sim (\eta/M_p)^2$, e.g.~the current upper bound from the CMB is $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$, whereas GW searches in pulsar timing arrays constrain the tension to $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-11}$. Cosmic strings are energetic objects that move at relativistic speeds. The combination of these two factors immediately suggests that strings should be a powerful source of GWs.

Whenever cosmic strings are formed in the early Universe, their dynamics drive them rather rapidly into an attractor solution, characterized by their energy density maintaining always a fixed fraction of the background energy density of the Universe. This is known as the `scaling' regime. During this regime, strings will collide, possibly exchanging `partners' and reconnecting afterwards. This is known as `intercommutation'. For topological strings the intercommutation probability is $\mathcal{P}=1$, whereas $\mathcal{P}<1$ is characteristic in cosmic superstrings networks. Closed string configurations -- loops -- are consequently formed when a string self-intersects, or two strings cross. Loops smaller than the horizon decouple from the string network and oscillate under their own tension, which results in the emission of gravitational radiation (eventually leading to the decay of the loop). The relativistic nature of strings typically leads to the formation of {\it cusps}, corresponding to points where the string momentarily moves at the speed of light~\cite{Turok:1984cn}. Furthermore, the intersections of strings generates discontinuities on their tangent vector known as {\it kinks}. All loops are typically expected to contain cusps and kinks, both of which generate GW bursts~\cite{Damour:2000wa,Damour:2001bk}. Hence, a network of cosmic (super-)strings formed in the early Universe is expected to radiate GWs throughout the entire cosmological history, producing a stochastic background of GWs from the superposition of many uncorrelated bursts.\footnote{An alternative strategy to the detection of cosmic string networks is the search for sufficiently strong GW transient signals~\cite{Aasi:2013vna,Abbott:2017mem} which do not form part of the stochastic background of GWs.}

A network of cosmic strings contains therefore, at every moment of its evolution (once in scaling), sub-horizon loops, and long strings that stretch across a Hubble volume. The latter are either infinite strings or in the form of super-horizon loops, and are also expected to emit GWs. However, the dominant contribution is generically that produced by the superposition of radiation from many sub-horizon loops along each line of sight.

The power emitted into gravitational radiation by an isolated loop of length $l$ can be calculated using the standard formulae in the weak gravity regime~\cite{Weinberg:1972kfs}. More explicitly, we can assume that, on average, the total power emitted by a loop is given by $P_{\rm 1Loop} = \Gamma \times (\mathrm{G} \mu) \times \mu$, with $\mathrm{\Gamma}$ is a dimensionless constant (independent of the size and shape of the loops). Estimates from simple loops~\cite{Vachaspati:1984gt,Burden:1985md,Garfinkle:1987yw}, as well as results from Nambu-Goto simulations~\cite{Blanco-Pillado:2017oxo}, suggest that $\mathrm{\Gamma}=50$. The GW radiation is only emitted at discrete frequencies by each loop, $\omega_n = 2\pi n/T$, where $T=l/2$ is the period of the loop, and $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ We can write $P_{\rm 1Loop} = \mathrm{G} \mu^2\sum_n P_n$, with $P_n$ characterizing the power emitted at each frequency $\omega_n$ for a particular loop, depending on whether the loop contains cusps, kinks, and kink-kink collisions~\cite{Burden:1985md,Allen:1991bk}. Namely, it can be shown that for large $n$,
$P_{ n}=\frac{\mathrm{\Gamma}}{\zeta(q)}n^{-q}$, where $\zeta(q)$ is the Riemann zeta function. The latter is simply introduced as a normalization factor, to enforce the total power of the loop to be equal to $\mathrm{\Gamma}=\sum_n P_n$. The parameter $q$ takes the values $4/3$,
$5/3$, or $2$ depending on whether the emission is dominated by cusps, kinks or kink-kink collision respectively, see e.g.~\cite{Vachaspati:1984gt,Binetruy:2009vt,Auclair:2019wcv}.

The resulting GW background from the stochastic background emitted by the loops chopped-off along the radiation domination period is characterized by a scale-invariant energy density spectrum, spanning over many frequency decades. The high-frequency cut-off of this plateau is determined by the temperature of the thermal bath at formation of the string network, with $T_\text{max} \lesssim 10^{16}$~GeV implying a turn-over frequency of $f_\Delta \lesssim 10^9$~GeV~\cite{Gouttenoire:2019kij}.
The amplitude of this plateau is given by~\cite{Auclair:2019wcv}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:plateauStringsNG}
\mathrm{\Omega}^{\rm plateau}_{\text{GW},0}(f) \approx 8.04\, \Omega_{\text{rad},0} \sqrt{\frac{G\mu}{\mathrm{\Gamma}}}\,.
\end{equation}
In particular, this does not depend on the exact form of the loop's power spectrum, nor on whether the GW emission is dominated by cusps or kinks, but rather depends only on the total GW radiation emitted by the loops. The amplitude in Eq.~\eqref{eq:plateauStringsNG} indicates that the stochastic GW background from cosmic strings can be rather large.\footnote{{\it Important remark}: as the characteristic width $\delta \sim 1/\eta$ of a cosmic string is generally much smaller than the horizon scale, it is commonly assumed that strings can be described by the Nambu-Goto (NG) action, which is the leading-order approximation when the curvature scale of the strings is much larger than their thickness. The above plateau amplitude Eq.~\eqref{eq:plateauStringsNG} applies only for the case of NG strings. For NG strings to reach scaling, the GW emission of the loops is actually crucial, as it is the loss of loops from the network that guarantees the scaling. The loops need therefore to decay in some way (this is precisely what the GW emission takes care of), so that their energy is not accounted anymore as part of the string network. However, in field theory simulations of string networks~\cite{Vincent:1997cx,Hindmarsh:2008dw,Daverio:2015nva,Hindmarsh:2017qff}, the network of infinite strings reaches a scaling regime thanks to energy loss into classical radiation of the fields involved in the simulations. The simulations show the presence of extensive massive radiation being emitted, and that the loops formed decay within a Hubble time. This intriguing discrepancy has been under debate for the last $\sim$ 20 years, but the origin of this massive radiation in the lattice simulations is not understood.}

Moreover, if the phase transition responsible for cosmic string formation is embedded into a larger grand unified group, then, depending on the structure of that larger group, cosmic strings may be only metastable, decaying via the (exponentially suppressed) production of monopoles~\cite{Vilenkin:1982hm,Monin:2008mp,Monin:2009ch,Leblond:2009fq}. In this case, the low-frequency end of the spectrum, corresponding to GW emission at later times, will be suppressed and the signal may \textit{only} be detectable in the high-frequency range~\cite{Leblond:2009fq,Dror:2019syi,Buchmuller:2019gfy,Buchmuller:2020lbh}. In this case, the string tension is only bounded by the BBN bound, $G \mu \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and the scale-invariant part of the spectrum may extend from $10^3$~Hz (LIGO constraint) up to $10^9$~Hz (network formation).

Finally, let us recall that long strings (infinite and super-horizon loops) also radiate GWs. One contribution to this signal is given by the GWs emitted around the horizon scale at each moment of cosmic history, as the network energy-momentum tensor adapts itself to maintaining scaling~\cite{Krauss:1991qu,JonesSmith:2007ne,Fenu:2009qf,Figueroa:2012kw,Figueroa:2020lvo}. This background is actually expected to be emitted by any network of cosmic defects in scaling, independently of the topology and origin of the defects~\cite{Figueroa:2012kw}. It represents therefore an irreducible background generated by any type of defect network. In the case of cosmic string networks modelled by the Nambu-Goto approximation (where the thickness of the string is taken to be zero), this background represents a very sub-dominant signal compared to the GW background emitted from the loops. In the case of field theory strings (for which simulations to date indicate the absence of `stable' loops), it is instead the only GW signal (and hence the dominant one) emitted by the network.

The GW energy density spectrum of this irreducible background from long strings is predicted to be exactly scale-invariant, for the modes emitted during radiation domination~\cite{Figueroa:2012kw}. The power spectrum of this background therefore mimics the spectral shape of the dominant signal from the loop decay, but with a smaller amplitude. The amplitude of the irreducible GW background from string networks depends ultimately on the fine details of the so called \textit{unequal-time-correlator} of the network's energy-momentum tensor. This correlator, however, can be obtained only  accurately from sufficiently large scale lattice simulations. In the case of global defects, the scale-invariant GW power spectrum has been obtained numerically with massively parallelized lattice field theory simulations for global strings\footnote{The irreducible background from the more interesting case of Abelian-Higgs lattice field theory simulations, has unfortunately not been yet studied.} as~\cite{Figueroa:2012kw}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GWSOSFplateau}
    \mathrm{\Omega}_{\text{GW}, 0}\simeq 4\times 10^4\, \mathrm{\Omega}_{\text{rad},0} (G\mu)^2\,.
\end{equation}
Despite the numerical prefactor being much larger than unity, the quadratic scaling proportional to $(G\mu)^2$ suppresses significantly the amplitude, see e.g.~\cite{Buchmuller:2013lra} for a comparison among GW signals emitted from the same string network. This amplitude is clearly subdominant when compared to the amplitude of the GW signal from the loops, which scales as $(G\mu)^{1/2}$,  see Eq.~\eqref{eq:plateauStringsNG}. A proper assessment of the power spectrum of this stochastic background requires further results not available yet; namely, lattice simulations of cosmic networks with a larger dynamical range.

Finally, we point out that since the irreducible GW emission described before is expected from any scaling defect network, global texture networks also emit a GW background due to their self-ordering during scaling~\cite{JonesSmith:2007ne,Fenu:2009qf,Giblin:2011yh,Figueroa:2012kw, Figueroa:2020lvo}. Textures are formed when the second (or higher) homotopy group of the vacuum manifold is non-trivial~\cite{Vilenkin:2000jqa}. One can achieve such condition in either case of the symmetry breaking of a global or a gauge group. In the case of a global group, the GW spectrum is scale invariant for radiation domination~\cite{JonesSmith:2007ne,Fenu:2009qf,Figueroa:2012kw}, and exhibits a peak at the horizon today for matter domination~\cite{Figueroa:2020lvo}. For a gauge group the GW spectrum is suppressed at low-frequencies as the massive gauge boson can prevent self-ordering as the gauge field can cancel the gradient field at large scales. The peak frequency and amplitude of a gauge texture is therefore set by the symmetry breaking scale $v$~\cite{Dror:2019syi},
\begin{equation}
    f \sim  \left(\frac{v}{M_p}\right) \, 10^{11} \, {\rm Hz} \,, \qquad
    \Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \left(\frac{v}{M_p}\right)^4 \,.
    \label{eq:gaugetextures}
\end{equation}
Given the frequency and amplitude both increase with $v$, it is only reasonable to consider high-frequency signals.


\subsubsection{Evaporating primordial black holes}
\label{sec:EvaporatingPBHs}

Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers} discussed the GW signal emitted by primordial BHs that merge in the late Universe. Note that light primordial BHs (with mass smaller than $10^{11} \, {\rm kg}$) that evaporate before BBN could produce a stochastic spectrum of GWs by merging and scattering~\cite{Dolgov:2011cq}. The typical frequency for such a source is at $f \gtrsim \rm{GHz}$. Here we consider yet another source of GWs tied to primordial BHs, namely the emission of gravitons as part of the Hawking radiation of primordial BHs. This is particularly relevant for light primordial BHs which evaporated before BBN  and for primordial BHs which have life time ranging from BBN until today ($10^{11} \, {\rm kg} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{14} \, {\rm kg}$).

The graviton emission from a population of primordial BHs induces a stochastic background of GWs~\cite{Anantua:2008am,Dong:2015yjs} that peaks at very high-frequencies, between $f\sim 10^{13} \, {\rm Hz}$ and $ 10^{22} \, {\rm Hz}$.
The shape and amplitude of the GW frequency spectrum depends on multiple factors, such as primordial BH abundance at formation, their mass spectrum, their eventual spin, the number of degrees of freedom in the particle theory. Roughly speaking, due to the redshift of GW amplitude and frequency, the observed GW spectrum is dominated by the latest stages of the primordial BH evolution and the frequency is hence set by the evaporation time (and hence the initial mass) of the primordial BH.

Taking into account the limits on the primordial BH abundance from BBN and extra-galactic background radiation, the maximum amplitude can be up to $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \approx 10^{-7.5}$ for primordial BHs evaporating just before BBN, $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{11} \, {\rm kg}$.  For heavier ones that might have not yet totally evaporated today, $10^{11} \, {\rm kg} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{14} \, {\rm kg}$, it can be up to $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \approx 10^{-6.5}$~\cite{Dong:2015yjs}, with a spectrum peaked at frequencies between $10^{18}$ Hz and $10^{22}$ Hz.

The most interesting case are possibly much lighter primordial BHs which would have completely evaporated well before BBN, e.g.\ if they are produced at an energy close to the grand unification scale, $E \sim 10^{15} \, {\rm GeV}$. Because the primordial BH density decreases like $\propto 1/a^3$ and the radiation density is $\propto 1/a^4$, such early decaying primordial BHs can be very abundant in the early Universe, leading to an early matter dominated phase. GWs produced in their decay could then constitute a sizable fraction of the subsequent radiation dominated phase, limited only by the BBN and CMB constraints (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:BBNbound}). For primordial BHs from the rand unification scale, the GW frequency spectrum has a peak around $10^{15}$ Hz and can reach an amplitude $\Omega_{\text{GW},0} \sim 10^{-8}$ for number of degrees of freedom $n_{\rm dof}\sim 10^3$~\cite{Anantua:2008am}.  It might therefore be in the range of detection of future instruments.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\label{sec:Misc}

In this section we summarize a few more ideas that have been shown to be relevant for high-frequency GW production but require more exotic setups to be realized and do not find place in the classification proposed above.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Brane-world scenarios}: the brane-world scenario~\cite{Rubakov:1983bb} proposes that the very weak force of gravity in our $(3+1)$-dimensional Universe is only a part of the full strength gravity which is felt in the fifth dimension at a level commensurate with the other forces. This scenario suggests that two $(3+1)$-dimensional branes - one of which represents our $4$-dimensional Universe - are separated in a fifth dimension by a small distance~\cite{Randall:1998uk, Maartens:2010ar}. If violent gravitational events - such as BH mergers - take place on the `shadow' brane, which is in close proximity to our brane - they would excite oscillations not only in the shadow brane but also in the fifth dimensional brane separation, leading to GW production on our visible brane~\cite{Seahra1, Seahra2}.
    \item \textit{Pre Big Bang cosmology}: the pre Big Bang scenario provides an alternative to cosmological inflation to provide the initial conditions for the hot Big Bang theory. The scenario exploits the fundamental symmetries of string theory to build a model in which the Universe starts in a cold and empty state in the infinite past and moves towards a state of high curvature through an accelerated expansion~\cite{Gasperini:2002bn, Gasperini:2007vw}. The state of high curvature corresponds to a region in the parameter space in which the theory is strongly coupled. It is then assumed that the strongly coupled theory is able to match this initial accelerated expansion to the usual hot Big Bang cosmology. Interestingly, this scenario predicts a blue spectrum of GWs, with a peak at high-frequency~\cite{Brustein:1995ki}.
    \item \textit{Quintessential inflation}: if the inflationary epoch is followed by a phase in which the equation of state is stiffer than radiation, the stochastic spectrum of GWs features a growth at high-frequency, followed by a sharp cutoff~\cite{Giovannini:1999bh}. This kind of behaviour is expected in quintessential models of inflation, such as the one investigated in~\cite{Peebles:1998qn}. The position of the peak depends very weakly on the number of minimally coupled scalar fields of the model, but it is independent of the final curvature at the end of inflation. Therefore, it is located at $100 \, \text{GHz}$ and cannot be moved around. The amplitude of the GW spectrum can become very large: in~\cite{Giovannini:1999bh} the authors present a choice of the parameters such that $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \simeq 10^{-6}$ at the peak.
    \item \textit{Magnetars}: magnetars are neutron stars that feature very large surface magnetic fields $\sim 10^9-10^{11} \, \text{T}$. Ref.~\cite{Wen:2017itr} suggests that gamma-ray bursts produced by the magnetar itself or by a companion body forming a binary system, and interacting with the surface magnetic field of the magnetar could be the source of high-frequency GW, with frequency around $10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$ and energy density up to $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \sim 10^{-6}$.
    \item \textit{Reheating}: Ref.~\cite{Ema:2020ggo} shows that there exists a model-independent contribution to the stochastic GW background, due to the oscillations of the inflaton (or any other scalar field that oscillates around its minimum after inflation) around the minimum of its potential during preheating. These oscillations provide a driving force in the equation of motion for the tensor modes, leading to GW production at high-frequency $\gtrsim 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$. The amplitude of this signal is bound to be quite small: in Ref.~\cite{Ema:2020ggo} the authors present a choice of parameters such that $\Omega_{\rm GW, 0} \lesssim 10^{-21}$.
    \item \textit{Thermal gravitational noise of  the Sun}: the thermal motion of charged particles in the plasma of protons and electrons present at the core of stars leads to the production of a gravitational radiation noise~\cite{Weinberg:1972kfs, BisnovatyiKogan:2004bk}. The frequency of this radiation is determined by the frequency of the collisions and, in the case of the Sun, it falls in the range $(10^{12}-10^{18})\,$ Hz.
    \item \textit{Plasma instabilities}: in Ref.~\cite{Servin:2003cf} the authors studied the interaction of electromagnetic waves and GWs in a magnetised plasma. In the high-frequency regime, a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave travelling parallel to the background magnetic field present in a plasma generates a GWs with the same frequency of the electromagnetic wave.
\end{itemize}

In summary, a broad range of theoretically well motivated extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of GW sources at different stages in the evolution of our Universe. The corresponding GW frequency range and amplitudes are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} and in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} as well as in Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-stochastic} and Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-coherent} in App.~\ref{sec:SummaryTable}.

\section{Detection of gravitational waves at high-frequencies}
\label{sec:exp}

After the first detection of GWs at frequencies in the range $(0.1 - 2.0)\,$ kHz~\cite{PhysRevX.9.031040}, the expansion into other frequency bands is a natural next step -- as it was in the 1950's when radio, X-Ray and UV observations became possible with new technology. As detailed in the previous section, many exciting questions in astronomy, cosmology and fundamental physics are tied to GW signals with frequencies (far) above the capabilities of current detectors or their upgrades. Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} give an impression of the range of GW amplitudes expected for various coherent and stochastic sources.
%
Even GW upper limits with no known source targets at the time of publication {of this white paper} may be valuable in restricting physical theories.

In this section, we will investigate the experimental possibilities for the detection of high-frequency GWs. First, we will give an overview of current GW detectors and their limitations, followed by the introduction of several concepts for the detection of high-frequency signals.
%
{Depending on the detector concept and the targeted sources, we quote detector sensitivities in terms of strain $\sqrt{S_n}$ or in terms of the dimensionless quantities $h_{c,n}$ (for stochastic signals) and $h_{0,n,mono}$ (for monochromatic signals), see Sec.~\ref{sec:Notation} for details. Careful consideration of operation and bandwidth is needed to convert between these quantities. }

\subsection{Laser interferometers and resonant mass detectors and their limitations}
\label{sec:detectors}

The first GWs were detected by the Advanced LIGO~\cite{PhysRevLett.116.131103} detectors in the US and the Advanced Virgo detector in Italy~\cite{AdvVirgo}. In early 2020, the Japanese KAGRA detector~\cite{PhysRevD.88.043007} joined LIGO's third observing run. These detectors are all based on the principle of a Michelson interferometer, using large suspended mirrors with several kilometers distance between them. Several other detectors are in the design phase. These  detectors typically have their peak sensitivity at frequencies of a few hundred Hz.

However, some future detectors are designed to particularly expand the detection band towards either low or high-frequencies.
To expand the detection band of Earth-bound interferometers to frequencies below 10\,Hz, cryogenically cooled mirrors, large beam diameters and operation underground are considered~\cite{ETdesign,Adhikari_2020}.
LISA, also based on laser interferometry, is a planned, satellite-based detector to increase the arm length beyond the possibilities on Earth and to reduce environmental noise sources such as seismic noise~\cite{Audley:2017drz}. LISA will have its peak-sensitivity in the mHz range. To increase interferometer sensitivity towards higher frequencies, options are an increase of laser power and/or resonant operation. The planned Australian NEMO detector will be targeting frequencies of up to several kHz, see Sec.~\ref{sec:ozgrav} below.\footnote{We note that through the GW memory effect~\cite{Christodoulou:1991cr,Thorne:1992sdb}, these interferometers are sensitive to high-frequency GW bursts far beyond their nominal frequency band~\cite{mcneill2017gravitational,ebersold2020search}. }


While increasing the arm-length of an interferometer increases strain signal in some frequency band, longer arms are only really beneficial as long as the GW wavelength is longer than the interferometer arms. For significantly higher frequencies (MHz) interferometers with arm-lengths of meters are more suitable, but are of course at the same time limited by the smaller strain sensitivity achievable with shorter arms. This constitutes the main limitation of laser interferometers, used as direct strain meters,
towards higher GW signal frequencies.


A concept to detect GWs which existed prior to the interferometers are resonant bar detectors, initially proposed and built by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Their modern successors, resonant spheres, have peak sensitivities at several kHz. In Sec.~\ref{sec:spheres}, we will give a summary of these resonant spheres.

\subsubsection{Laser Interferometers: Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO)} \label{sec:ozgrav}

The first detection of a binary neutron star merger coalescence in 2017~\cite{abbott2017gw170817} has increased the interest in the development of GW detectors with sensitivity in the few kHz regime which will be capable of detecting the merger and ringdown part of the waveform~\cite{martynov2019exploring}. It is expected that such detectors will need to have strain sensitivities approaching $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 10^{-24}\, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ in the range $(1-4)\,$kHz for events that are likely to occur a few times per year. This sensitivity should be achieved by the third generation terrestrial GW detectors that are anticipated to come online in the later half of the 2030s~\cite{Evans:2016mbw,Punturo:2010zz}. The Australian GW community is currently exploring the feasibility of a new detector, `NEMO', dedicated to detecting this merger phase and the following ringdown as well as testing third generation technology on a smaller scale~\cite{ozhf, Bailes:2019oma,Adya2020}. The planned sensitivity of this detector would reach $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 10^{-24}\, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ in the range $(1 - 2.5)\,$kHz~\cite{ozhf}. This detector will work in collaboration with the existing second generation GW detector network that will provide sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up.

The dominant high-frequency noise source for interferometric GW detectors is quantum phase noise or shot noise as it is otherwise called. The magnitude of this noise source is inversely proportional to the square of the product of the circulating power incident on the test masses and the length of the arms of the detector. This generally necessitates extremely high powers in the arms of the interferometers ($\approx 5 \,\text{MW}$ in the case of NEMO). Such high circulating powers lead to technical issues such as parametric and tilt instabilities and thermal induced distortions. These issues can be challenging to deal with, however a dedicated high-frequency detector promises to make this easier. This is because low-frequency sensitivity limits the actuation that can be applied to the test masses to correct instabilities and distortions. Further, relaxing the low-frequency sensitivity relaxes the requirements on seismic isolation and test mass suspension systems that can significantly reduce the cost.

\subsubsection{Interferometers up to 100\,MHz}
\label{sec:100MHzInterferometers}

As was first pointed out by Mizuno~\cite{Mizuno}, in laser interferometers the overall stored energy in the form of circulating laser power sets a limit on the achievable sensitivity and bandwidth, which is a consequence of the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. For a given laser power, higher bandwidth needs to be traded in for an increase in sensitivity. While opto-mechanical resonances can be introduced in the signal response of interferometers to shape the sensitivity curve for specific frequencies~\cite{Somiya:2016pla,Korobko:2018pla}, it appears unlikely that the stored laser power can be further increased by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, broadband interferometric detectors reaching into the MHz detection range (while maintaining LIGO or Virgo-level strain sensitivity) seem not to be a viable option when taking also the arm-length argument from above into account.

Nevertheless there are three notable efforts (two existing and one under construction) of laser interferometers in the MHz range, which currently set the best experimental upper limits on GWs in their respective frequency bands.

One option is to build kHz-bandwidth interferometric detectors that are centered around much higher frequencies. Akutsu et al.~\cite{akutsu} have published upper limits from such a system working at 100 MHz. The detector used a synchronous recycling architecture based on a resonant recycling cavity of dimension 75\,cm and a Nd:YAG laser with a power output of 0.5 W. The limit on stochastic GW signals was reported to be $\sqrt{S_n} \sim 10^{-16}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$, placing a bound of $h_{c,\rm sto} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{-14}$. A study of the potential of this technique~\cite{Nishizawa} showed that a sensitivity of $10^{-20}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ is possible at 100\,MHz with a bandwidth of 2\,kHz, but the sensitivity decreases with increasing frequency and is not competitive above 1\,GHz.

The sensitivity of a single instrument can be surpassed by correlating two co-located instruments in the case of searching for stochastic signals from GWs or other sources.
The \emph{Holometer} experiment at Fermilab consists of two co-located power recycled Michelson interferometers with 40-meter long arms. While their primary research target has been signatures of quantization of spacetime, they reach a sensitivity of $10^{-21} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ approximately in the band $(1-13)\,$MHz~\cite{PhysRevD.95.063002}. Using a 704-hr dataset from the Holometer experiment, the authors of Ref.~\cite{Martinez:2020cdh} concluded that there are no identifiable harmonic sources such as cosmic string loops and eccentric BH binaries emitting in the frequency range $(1-25) \, \text{MHz}$.

The experimental GW group at Cardiff University is planning a set of two wide-band table-top interferometers sensitive in the band $(1-100)\,$MHz~\cite{vermeulen2020experiment}.
These will be able to set new upper limits on a stochastic GW background in this frequency band.

\subsubsection{Spherical resonant masses}
\label{sec:spheres}

The principle of a \textit{resonant mass detector} is that its vibrational eigenmodes can get excited by a GW. These mechanical oscillations are transformed into electrical signals, using electromechanical transducers, and amplified by electrical amplifiers. These resonant detectors have a relatively small bandwidth, usually of less than 100~Hz. Thermal noise, Johnson-Nyquist noise, pump phase noise (if the transducer is parametric), back-action noise, and amplifier noise are the internal noises of this kind of detector. Therefore, the resonant mass antenna and transducers are made of high-quality factor
materials in order to decrease thermal (mechanical) and Johnson-Nyquist (electrical) noises.

The idea of a spherical resonant mass antenna for GW detection has a long history and was first proposed by Robert L. Forward in 1971~\cite{Forward1971} followed by several decades of exploration and proposals~\cite{wagoner1977multimode, hamilton1990resonant, PhysRevLett.70.2367}.
In 1991, Aguiar  proposed a large spherical antenna project in Brazil~\cite{Aguiar:2010kn}. This detector, Mario Schenberg, in S\~ao Paulo, Brazil\cite{Da_Silva_Costa_2014}, was started to be built in 2000, around the same time as Mini-GRAIL, in Leiden, Netherlands. These two spherical detectors were active for about 15 years. At present, they are decommissioned, but Schenberg is planned to be reassembled at INPE, in S\~ao Jos\'e dos Campos, about 100 km from its initial site at the University of S\~ao Paulo.\footnote{These detectors had much smaller masses and diameters than originally proposed in the ’90s of up to 120\,Tons and 3\,m, respectively, resonant around $\sim 700\,$ Hz.} Such detectors have a bandwidth of 50-100 Hz with peak frequencies around 3 kHz for the quadrupole modes. To increase the frequency range, a xylophone configuration of several spheres has been proposed~\cite{PhysRevD.54.2409}.

Spherical antennas provide more information, compared to the classical bar antennas, because of their quadrupole modes, while also being significantly more sensitive due to their favorable geometry of having a larger cross-section at identical mass. From the output of six 6 transducers tuned to the quadrupole modes of the sphere, a single sphere can obtain complete information about the polarization and direction of the incoming wave.

In 2004, Mini-GRAIL reached a peak strain sensitivity of $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 1.5 \times 10^{-20} \;\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at a frequency of 2942.9\,Hz at temperatures of 5\,K. Over a bandwidth of 30\,Hz, the strain sensitivity was  about $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-20}\; \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$~\cite{Gottardi:2007zn}.
Schenberg operating also at 5\,K, reached strain sensitivities of $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 1.1 \times  10^{-19}\; \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for its quadrupolar modes ($\sim 3.2 \,$ kHz) and $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 1.2 \times  10^{-20}\; \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for its monopolar mode ($\sim 6.5 \,$ kHz), in 2015. Both antennas could reach sensitivities around $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 10^{-22}\; \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ when operating at 15\,mK. Schenberg, because it uses parametric transducers, can reach higher sensitivities if it implements squeezing of the signal. In this case, it would have similar sensitivities as the ultimate sensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo around 3.2\,kHz.\footnote{However, the interferometric detectors have a peak sensitivity around one order of magnitude higher at a few hundred Hz.}

The conceptual difficulties in pushing this technology to higher frequencies are similar to the issues discussed for laser interferometers. Searching for GWs at higher frequencies requires smaller resonating spheres and consequently requires measuring smaller absolute displacements to achieve the same strain sensitivity. Note also that contrary to laser interferometers, resonant mass detectors have not yet reached the standard quantum limit yet. It thus seems unlikely that this technology can be pushed significantly beyond the kHz region.

\subsection{Detection at frequencies beyond current detectors}

In this section we will introduce several ideas and concepts for the detection of GWs at high-frequencies beyond the capabilities of currently existing GW detectors.

\subsubsection{Optically levitated sensors}
\label{sec:OpticallyLevitatedSensors}

\textit{Optically levitated dielectric sensors} have been identified as a promising technique for resonant GW searches spanning a wide frequency band from a few $\sim$ kHz to $\sim 300$ kHz \cite{arvanitaki:2016gw,aggarwal2020searching}. A dielectric nano-particle suspended appropriately at the anti-node of a  laser standing wave within an optical cavity will experience a force when a passing GW causes a time-varying strain of the physical length of the cavity. The particle will be displaced from the location of the trapping light anti-node, resulting in a kick on the particle at the frequency of the GW space-time disturbance. The trapping frequency and mechanical resonance linewidth are widely tunable based on the laser intensity and laser cooling parameters chosen. For possible sources in this frequency band see e.g.~Sec.~\ref{sec:NS}, Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers} and Sec.~\ref{sec:ECOs}.

When detecting the resulting displacement of the particle at the trapping resonance frequency, the sensitivity is limited by Brownian thermal noise in the particle itself rather than the displacement detection of the particle. This results in improved sensitivity at higher frequency (unlike traditional interferometer style detectors which decrease sensitivity at high-frequency due to laser shot noise)~\cite{arvanitaki:2016gw}.  The low-friction environment made possible by optical levitation in ultra-high vacuum enables extremely sensitive force detection~\cite{Ranjit:2016zn}, which becomes ultimately quantum-limited by photon-recoil heating from discrete scattering events of individual trap laser photons~\cite{Jain:2016re}.

A 1-meter prototype Michelson-interferometer configuration detector called the `Levitated Sensor Detector' is under construction at Northwestern University in the US, with a target sensitivity of better than $\sqrt{S_n}  \sim {10}^{-19} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $10$ kHz and $\sqrt{S_n} \sim 10^{-21} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $100$ kHz~\cite{aggarwal2020searching}. With Prof. P. Barker and coworkers at partner institution University College London, fiber-based approaches are being investigated to permit longer cavities without the need for expensive optics~\cite{Pontin:2018fi}. The ultimate strain sensitivity of a $10$-meter room-temperature instrument is estimated to be better than approximately $\sqrt{S_n}  \sim {10}^{-20} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $10$ kHz and $\sqrt{S_n}  \sim 10^{-22} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $100$ kHz. For a cryogenic $100$-meter instrument this can be improved by more than an order of magnitude across much of the frequency band~\cite{aggarwal2020searching}. A detailed analysis of the search reach for GWs produced by axions via the BH superradiance process is provided in Ref.~\cite{aggarwal2020searching}.

\subsubsection{Inverse Gertsenshtein effect}
\label{sec:inv_gertsenshtein}
The \textit{Gertsenshtein effect} describes the conversion of photons to GWs in the presence of a magnetic field and was considered already decades ago as a source of GWs~\cite{Gertsenshtein}. While the coupling constant for this process is too small to be of interest for experiments in the near to medium future, the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, frequently referred to as magnetic conversion, can indeed be used to search for GWs~\cite{Boccaletti1970,Fuzfa:2015oaa,Fuzfa:2017ana}. While such dedicated instruments do not exist yet (apart from small prototypes), a first step in this direction has been done by using existing data from axion-search experiments. In these experiments, typically a strong static magnetic field of several Tesla is set up with field lines perpendicular to some interaction region, through which a beam line passes. In their nominal usage these experiments would search for axion-like particles, which can convert to photons in the presence of the magnetic field. These photons would be detected at the end of the beam line by electromagnetic detectors within the frequency band of interest (e.g. photodetectors for optical radiation).
The very same experimental arrangements can also be used to search for GWs, by re-interpreting the acquired data,
as has been pointed out and performed by the work in Ref.~\cite{Ejlli2019}.
This work could set first upper limits for GWs at optical and X-ray frequencies (i.e.\ around 500\,THz and $10^{6}$\,THz respectively).

In the future this class of experiment is expected to continue with larger detectors of this sort being constructed. Given the motivation in the context of searches for high-frequency GWs, a dual usage of these detectors could be imagined
with dedicated instruments and operational modes to search for GWs. For example, the planned IAXO detector~\cite{Armengaud:2014gea} aims at searching for axions produced in the core of the sun. If it were  fitted with different electromagnetic receivers, from radio to optical frequencies, GW searches could be facilitated in these bands. A particular advantage of searches with IAXO would be that the device can be pointed (within some limits) to different points in the sky. It could be of particular interest to point to patches in the sky where, for example, a binary BH merger is predicted to happen. The latter is a real prospect once the LISA space interferometer will be operational, which can detect inspiralling BHs long before their merger.

Note that, in principle, the inverse Gertsenshtein effect might be exploited at all frequencies, and that one further advantage of this concept is the tunability of the solid angle, which changes according to the direction of the magnetic field, see Sec.~\ref{subsec:switch}. In particular, the inverse Gertsenshtein effect has substantial room for development especially at GHz frequencies where many of the early Universe signals converge. Using magnets developed for particle accelerators a conversion path length of 100 metres with uniform magnetic field of 5.6\,T is quite realistic, and being implemented for the ALPS experiment searching for axion-like particles~\cite{Bahre:2013ywa}. Electromagnetic detectors having a thermal noise equivalent to 0.1 Kelvin would lead to a sensitivity around $h_{c,n} \simeq 10^{-26}$. This sensitivity could be further enhanced by the inclusion of a Fabry Perot cavity in the conversion volume and a factor of 100 improvement might be possible. Unfortunately, this improved sensitivity would be gained at the expense of the wide bandwidth of the technique and this would limit the applicability to stochastic signals. Reference~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} estimates the sensitivity that can be reached in the GHz region by using Single Photon Detectors (SPD) and Heterodyne radio receivers (HET). The corresponding limits are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary}.

The conversion of GWs to photons by the inverse Gertsenshtein effect cannot only be exploited in a laboratory setting but also by considering astrophysical or even cosmological `detectors', see e.g.~\cite{Pshirkov:2009sf, PhysRevLett.74.634, Dolgov:2012be, Cillis:1996qy,Domcke:2020yzq}. In this case, the magnetic field is weaker and the background is much harder to control, but cosmic magnetic fields can extend coherently over kpc or even Mpc, implying an enormous `detector volume'. The frequency range of MHz to GHz coincides with the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, a target of existing and upcoming radio telescopes. For example, the data of ARCADE 2~\cite{Fixsen_2011} and EDGES~\cite{Bowman:2018yin} can be recast to respectively constrain $h_{c,\rm sto} < 10^{-24}  (10^{-14})$ in the range $3 \, {\rm GHz} \lesssim f  \lesssim 30 \, {\rm GHz}$ and $h_{c, \rm sto}(f \approx 78 \, {\rm GHz}) < 10^{-12} (10^{-21})$ for the strongest (weakest) cosmic magnetic fields in accordance with current astrophysical data~\cite{Domcke:2020yzq}.

\subsubsection{GW to electromagnetic wave conversion in a static electric field}
\label{sec:ConversionEfield}

Lupanov \cite{Lupanov} considered the inverse Gertsenshtein effect but using a static electric field rather than a static magnetic field. The physics is essentially the same in the two cases but since the intensity of electric fields in laboratory settings is limited by the tendency to pull electrons from nearby conductors (or dielectrics) and thereby cause local short circuits, the available energy densities in electric fields are about one millionth of that created by magnetic fields in the several Tesla range. Hence the use of electric fields seems not to offer any advantages.

\subsubsection{Resonant polarisation rotation}
\label{sec:ResonantPolarisationRotation}

In 1983 Cruise~\cite{Cruise1} showed that a GW could induce a rotation of the plane of polarisation in electromagnetic waves in certain geometries, some of which might be relevant astronomically. In 2000 the idea of resonant polarization rotation was extended~\cite{Cruise2} to a situation in which the electromagnetic wave was a circulating wave in a microwave waveguide ring. The original effect was amplified by the (potentially significant) quality factor of the waveguide ring. A proof of concept apparatus was constructed by Cruise and Ingley~\cite{Cruise3, Cruise:2006zt}. Such a device would be narrowband with a sensitivity $\sqrt{S_n} \sim 10^{-14}\,\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at frequencies of 100\,MHz. It is difficult to see the sensitivity of this scheme for GW detection increasing very far beyond the published value.

\subsubsection{Heterodyne enhancement of magnetic conversion}
\label{sec:AmplificationMethods}

Li and co-workers~\cite{Li:2004df, Li:2006sx, Baker:2008zzb, Li} have suggested enhancing the conversion efficiency of magnetic conversion detectors such as those discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:inv_gertsenshtein}, {see also Ref.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} for a recent discussion}. This proposal has been specifically aimed at the detection of cosmological (relic) signals of a stochastic nature and with dimensionless amplitudes in the range $h_{c,\rm sto} \sim (10^{-30} - 10^{-26})$ at $5 \, \text{GHz}$, about the highest signal consistent with the BBN limit. The conversion from GW to electromagnetic wave is enhanced by seeding the conversion volume with a locally generated electromagnetic wave at the same frequency as that being searched for. In conditions in which the gaussian local oscillator beam is parallel to the incoming signal and at right angles to the static magnetic field, an additional beam of electromagnetic waves is generated by the conversion process, travelling at right angles to the incoming beam and the locally generated beam. The technical challenge is then to distinguish this perpendicular beam of, say, 800 photons/second from the locally generated beam at the same frequency and carrying $10^{24}$ photons/second at frequencies of several GHz~\cite{WOODS201266}. This demands a geometric purity in the Gaussian beam of better than $10^{-21}$, far beyond the current state of the art. The authors have proposed this interesting idea over many years but the lack of laboratory results on the performance of the necessary subsystems leaves the feasibility of this concept an open question.

\subsubsection{Bulk acoustic wave devices}
\label{sec:BAW}

\textit{Bulk acoustic wave devices} are one of the pillars of frequency control and frequency metrology~\cite{ScRep}. In its simplest form, a piece of piezoelectric material is sandwiched between two electrodes, converting the acoustic waves inside the material into electrical signals. With its relatively compact size and robustness, this technology gives one of the best levels of frequency stability near one second of integration time. More recently it was demonstrated that quartz bulk acoustic wave devices exhibit extremely high-quality factors (up to $8 \times 10^9$) at cryogenic temperatures for various overtones of the longitudinal mode covering the frequency range $(5 - 700)\,$MHz~\cite{ScRep,quartzPRL}. For this reason it was proposed to use the technology for various tests of fundamental physics~\cite{ScRep} such as Lorentz invariance tests~\cite{PhysRevX.6.011018}, quantum gravity research~\cite{PhysRevD.100.066020} and search for high-frequency GWs~\cite{Goryachev:2014ac}. For the latter purpose, a bulk acoustic wave device represents a resonant mass detector whose vibration could be read through the piezoelectric effect and a Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). The approach has the following advantages: highest quality factor (high-sensitivity), internal (piezoelectric) coupling to SQUIDs~\cite{Goryachev:2014ab}, allows parametric detection methods, large number of sensitive modes ($>100$) in a single device, modes scattered over wide frequency range ($1-700$)\,MHz, well-established and relatively inexpensive technology (mass production), high-precision (insensitive to external influences such as seismic vibration and temperature fluctuations). On the other hand, it is shown that at low temperatures identical devices demonstrate significant dispersion in mode frequencies, thus, showing low accuracy. The level of sensitivity of bulk acoustic wave detectors is estimated at the level of $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 2\times 10^{-22}\, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ subject to the mode geometry~\cite{Goryachev:2014ac}. With additional investment into research and development, this level can be improved and the frequency range extended down to hundreds of kHz range.

A search for high-frequency GWs with a single bulk acoustic wave devices and two modes at 4\,K has been running in the University of Western Australia since November 2018.

\subsubsection{Superconducting rings}
\label{sec:SuperconductingRings}

The quantum properties of vortices in superfluids may interact with spin components of the GWs. In addition, an extension of the electromagnetic impedance at a boundary in the case of GWs in a superconducting fluid suggests that the impedance mismatch well-known in classical bar detector theory is much reduced for a GW arriving at a boundary in a superconductor, essentially creating a very efficient mirror that could be used as a building block for an interferometer or Sagnac ring. Anandan and Chiao~\cite{Anandan, Chiao:2002nv} proposed a new detector format which utilises these putative principles, reaching a sensitivity of $h_{0, n, \rm mono} \sim 10^{-31}$. Resonant operation will restrict the bandwidth in the GHz range. A good review of the issues surrounding the interaction of mesoscopic quantum systems with gravity was prepared on an European Space Agency contract by Kiefer and Weber~\cite{Kiefer}. This review casts doubt on some of the assumptions made by Anandan and Chiao.

\subsubsection{GW deformation of microwave cavities}
\label{sec:HighQCavities}

Caves~\cite{Caves} published a theoretical study of a microwave cavity with a high mechanical quality factor. Mechanical deformation of the cavity by a GW coupled two of the cavity's resonant microwave modes and transferred the electromagnetic excitation to a previously unexcited cavity mode. Reece et al.~\cite{Reece} built a similar system with a higher resonant frequency of 1\,MHz and one operating at $10 \, \text{GHz}$~\cite{Reece:1982sc}, while Pegoraro et al.~\cite{Pegoraro} designed a system with a sharp resonance at about 1\,GHz. These schemes certainly offer some sensitivity in the frequency range above 1\,GHz but that is limited to around $h \sim 10^{-21}$ by the thermal noise in the microwave sensors. Even at cryogenic temperatures the sensitivity will be many orders of magnitude away from the level required for detecting cosmological sources. The bandwidth of this scheme is nominally limited by the bandwidth of the cavity, up to effects like detection or electronics gains and noises.


\subsubsection{Graviton-magnon resonance}
\label{sec:GravitonMagnonResonance}

As pointed out in Ref.~\cite{Ito:2019wcb}, a GW passing through a ferromagnetic insulator can resonantly excite magnons (collective excitations of electron spins), similar to the excitations of phonons in resonant bar detectors. The readout is achieved by placing the magnetic sample inside a microwave cavity, coupling the magnon to a photon mode. This idea builds on the technique of ferromagnetic haloscopes proposed to for axion searches~\cite{Crescini2018,Flower:2018qgb}.
%
The sensitivity of such detector reaches strain of $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 7.6 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $14$ GHz and $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $8.2$ GHz. The sensitivity of this approach can be greatly improved by incorporating single frequency counters that are already available. A few orders of magnitude in sensitivity have been shown for axion detection~\cite{PhysRevD.88.035020}.

\subsection{Summary of detector sensitivities}
\label{sec:SummarySensitivities}

In Tab.~\ref{tab:SummarySensitivity} we summarize the existing and proposed technologies for high-frequency GW detection, reporting the corresponding sensitivities. For all experiments that quote their sensitivity in terms of a power spectral density noise $S_n(f)$, a conversion to dimensionless strain $h_{c, n, \rm sto}$ has been performed using Eq.~\eqref{eq:charnoisesto} with 1 year as the observation time and the specified detector bandwidth. For the other detectors, we specify the dimensionless strain variable on a case by case basis: we use $h_{c, n, \rm sto}$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:charnoisesto}) for detectors that look for a stochastic signal, while we use $h_{0, n, \rm mono}$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:h0mono}) for detectors that look for a monochromatic GW. In the case of microwave cavities (see Sec.~\ref{sec:HighQCavities}) we denote the sensitivity by $h$ as it can refer either to bursts or to long duration signals, and we refer the reader to the original papers for the details, while we report the best sensitivity estimates. We also specify whether each experiment has already been built, is under construction, is only devised or only the physical mechanism has been identified (theory). {The sensitivity values labeled by an asterisk refer to the planned sensitivities that will be achieved by the proposed future improvements of the currently built setups.} Note that a square bracket in the frequency column refers to the bandwidth of the detector, while a round bracket refers to the range of frequencies\footnote{The range of center frequencies $f_\mathrm{center}$ over which the technical concept can be used, either by building the instrument at the desired operating frequency, or by scanning the frequency as in the case of optically levitated sensors. Not to be confused by the single-shot frequency range spanned by each detector.} that can be covered by the detector itself. We report the bandwidths used in Tab.~\ref{tab:SummarySensitivity} to obtain dimensionless strain from PSD: Mini-GRAIL had a bandwidth $\Delta f  \simeq 30 \, \text{Hz}$~\cite{Gottardi:2007zn}; the Schenberg antenna had a bandwidth $\Delta f \simeq 50 \, \text{Hz}$~\cite{Aguiar:2010kn}; the $0.75$ m interferometer has bandwidth $\Delta f \simeq 2 \, \text{kHz}$~\cite{akutsu}\footnote{Note that, despite the $0.75$ m interferometer~\cite{akutsu} is sensitive to frequencies around $100 \, \text{MHz}$, we do not see any reason that prevents this concept to be extended in the range kHz-$100\,$MHz. This is the reason why we covered this frequency range in Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary}.}; the optically levitated sensors have a bandwidth \(\Delta f = f/10\)
~\cite{arvanitaki:2016gw,aggarwal2020searching}; $\Delta f \simeq (10-50) \, \text{kHz}$ for Cruise's and Ingley's detector~\cite{Cruise3, Cruise:2006zt}; for enhanced magnetic conversion the bandwidth is $\Delta f \simeq 1 \, \text{Hz}$~\cite{Li}; bulk acoustic wave resonators have bandwidth $\Delta f = f/10^8$, where $f$ is in the ranges reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:SummarySensitivity}
~\cite{Goryachev:2014ab}; the bandwidth for Pegoraro's detector is $\Delta f \simeq 1 \, \text{Hz}$. For references that specify their detector sensitivity in dimensionless strain without specifying the exact form of the dimensionless strain, the sensitivities are labeled as just \(h\).

\subsection{Cross correlation detectors}
\label{sec:crosscorrelation}


For a coalescing binary the information about the waveform of GWs is available. The best approach to the detection problem is to use this information by projecting the observed data over the set of expected signals. Usually this set can be parameterized by a small number of parameters, varying in some allowed range. A `scalar product' between data and the set of `templates' is evaluated, using its maximum as a detection statistics.
%
It should be noted that the set of expected signals does not have a linear space structure, in the sense that the linear combination of two possible signals is not generally speaking a possible signal. For this reason the computational cost of a search over a `template bank' grows very fast with the number of free parameters.

When the number of parameters is large, or when a parameterization of the waveform of the expected signal is not possible at all, other detection methods must be used. In the present context this is the case for several cosmological processes, which are expected to produce a GW signal that can be described as an overlap of a very large number of contributions. There is not a waveform here, the expected signal is a stochastic process and the best approach for the detection is the cross correlation one.


\subsubsection{Relic gravitational radiation}

The detection of the CMB in 1965 by Penzias and Wilson gave the first experimental insight into the properties of `relic' radiation, the remnants currently observable of the Big Bang. The CMB is a stationary, stochastic radiation field, basically isotropic down to levels as low as $10^{-5}$ with a Gaussian distribution.

It is natural to suppose that a useful starting point in planning GW observations of a relic radiation would be to assume that cosmologically-sourced GWs can be modeled by a stochastic field $h_{ij}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ with relatively simple properties.
In the spacetime volume of a given experiment, we can describe our background as a superposition of plane waves
\begin{equation}
h_{ij}(\boldsymbol{x},t) = \sum_P \int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \tilde{h}_P(\boldsymbol{k}) \varepsilon_{ij}^P(\hat{k})
e^{i\boldsymbol{k}\boldsymbol{x}-i\omega_k t}
+\text{c.c} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Here $P$ labels the polarization degrees of freedom of the field, whose number can depend on the considered theory of gravitation. The `parameters' of the signal are the amplitudes $h_P(\boldsymbol{k})$ introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:th}, one for each mode of the field. When these must be considered stochastic variables, the relic gravitational radiation field is completely described by their (joint) probability distribution, and is called GW stochastic background.

For a Gaussian stochastic background this joint probability distribution is Gaussian, and is completely determined by the second order expectation value
\begin{equation}
	\left< \tilde{h}_A(\boldsymbol{p}) \tilde{h}_B(\boldsymbol{q})  \right> = \Gamma_{AB}\left(\boldsymbol{p},\boldsymbol{q}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
Further assumptions lead to the simplification of this general expression. For example, stationarity in a given reference frame requires the expectation value $\langle h_{ij}(\boldsymbol{x},t)h_{ij}(\boldsymbol{y},t^\prime)\rangle$ to be a function of $t-t^\prime$ only, and as a consequence the correlation between $h_A(\boldsymbol{p})$ and $h_B(\boldsymbol{q})$ can be non-zero only when $\omega_p=\omega_q$. Stationarity in every reference frame implies homogeneity, and only correlations with $\boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{q}$ are allowed.

Each stochastic model can have its peculiar signature (see also Sec.~\ref{sec:th}): in the simplest stationary, isotropic and Gaussian model a parameterization of the model can be given in term of an array of functions which are connected to contributions
\begin{equation}
	 \Gamma_{AB}\left(\boldsymbol{p},\boldsymbol{q}\right) \propto \frac{1}{f^3} \delta^2\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{p}},\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}\right) \delta(\omega_p-\omega_q) \Omega_{\rm GW}^{AB}\left(\omega_p\right) \,,
 \end{equation}
which is a generalization of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Sh}) and allows for a non trivial polarization structure.


If the radiation is stationary, a temporal signature which could be exploited by a single-instrument detection procedure is not available. Moreover, isotropy and homogeneity do not allow for a signal modulation which could be obtained in principle by changing the orientation or the position of the detector.\footnote{Note however that the motion of the detector with respect to the cosmic rest frame of a cosmological stochastic background breaks isotropy. This yields a (weak) signal modulation and can be exploited to extract polarization information from the stochastic background of GWs~\cite{Seto:2006hf,Seto:2006dz,Domcke:2019zls}.}

It could still be possible to detect the stochastic background as an `excess noise' in the apparatus. However in order to do that the amplitude of the signal must be large enough to make it evident given a theoretical estimate of the noise budget, which is always uncertain. This means that the strategy for detection will necessarily be different from the strategy for discrete source detection.

The most obvious approach is the use of spatial correlations. If a detector is to be developed for the detection of GW relic radiation then a decision to operate it as a correlation detector will have a far reaching influence on many aspects of its design.

An excellent review of GW relic radiation and appropriate methods of detection, in the context of HF band, has been published by Allen \cite{Allen} and important properties of correlation detectors have been explored by Michelson~\cite{Michelson}. The basic principle is to compare the signal from two detectors. This is comparing a random signal with another stationary, stochastic, isotropic, gaussian signal from the same source. Similar to template matching as a means of detecting discrete sources, in this case the template itself is random and that affects the statistical gain from performing a cross correlation between two detectors.


\subsubsection{Properties of correlation detectors}

At the simplest level the outputs $s_i(t)$ of two detectors can be written as
\begin{align}
	s_1(t) &= h_1(t) + n_1(t) \,,\nonumber \\
	s_2(t) &= h_2(t)+  n_2(t) \,,
\end{align}
where $h_{1,2}$ are the stochastic signals and $n_{1,2}$ the noises. We suppose both the signals and the noises to have typical amplitudes $h_i$, $n_i$ and typical bandwidth $\Delta f$.
If we evaluate the simple correlation over a time $T\gg \Delta f^{-1}$ between the two outputs
\begin{align}
	\hat{Y} = \int_t^{t+T} s_1(t') s_2(t') dt' \,,
\end{align}
we find an estimator which is distributed as a Gaussian variable for large enough $T$. Its mean is given by
\begin{align}
	\left<\hat{Y}\right> = \int_t^{t+T} \left<h_1(t') h_2(t')\right> dt' \propto C^{h_1 h_2}(0) T \,,
\end{align}
where the temporal cross-correlation $C^{h_1 h_2}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
C^{xy}(\tau) = \langle x(t) x(t+\tau) \rangle \,,
\end{equation}
and we supposed that the two noises are uncorrelated. The variance of $\hat Y$ is given by
\begin{align}
	\left<\hat{Y}^2\right>-\left<\hat{Y}\right>^2 & = \int_t^{t+T} dt' \int_t^{t+T} dt'' C^{n_1 n_1}(t'' - t') C^{n_2 n_2}(t''-t') \simeq \nonumber \\
	&\simeq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\tau C^{n_1 n_1}(\tau) C^{n_2 n_2}(\tau) \simeq \nonumber \\
	&\simeq T C^{n_1 n_1}(0) C^{n_2 n_2}(0) \frac{1}{\Delta f} \,,
\end{align}
and we see that the signal-to-noise ratio
\begin{align}
	\frac{\left<\hat{Y}\right>}{\sqrt{\left<\hat{Y}^2\right>-\left<\hat{Y}\right>^2}} \propto \frac{C^{h_1 h_2}(0)}{\sqrt{C^{n_1 n_1}(0) C^{n_2 n_2}(0)}} \sqrt{T\Delta f} \,,
\end{align}
increases as the square root of the measurement time. The minimum detectable energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ is
\begin{equation}
\Omega^{\rm min}_{\rm GW} \propto \sqrt{\frac{C^{n_1 n_1}(0) C^{n_2 n_2}(0)}{T \Delta f}} \,,
\end{equation}
 and decreases with the square root of $T$. Of course the minimum detectable signal amplitude is proportional to $\sqrt{\Omega^{\rm min}_{\rm GW}}$, so it decreases much slowly.

\subsubsection{The overlap function}

In the previous, very simple analysis we neglected all the effects that can be adsorbed in a proportionality factor.  For example when we evaluated the signal, we wrote
\begin{equation}
\left<h_1(t) h_2(t)\right> = K h_1 h_2 \,,
\end{equation}
implicitly assuming that $K=O(1)$. As a matter of fact the correlation between the signals coupled to two different detectors can be reduced by several effects.
The quantity of interest can always been obtained by the correlation between the gravitational strain at two different points
\begin{equation}
\left<\tilde{h}_{ij}^*(\boldsymbol{x},\omega) \tilde{h}_{k\ell}(\boldsymbol{y},\omega^\prime)\right> \propto
\sum_{P,P^\prime} \int d\hat{\Omega}_k d\hat{\Omega}_{k^\prime} \left<\tilde{h}_P^*(\hat{k},\omega)\tilde{h}_{P^\prime}(\hat{k}^\prime,\omega^\prime) \right> \varepsilon_{ij}^P(\hat{k}) \varepsilon_{k\ell}^{P^\prime}(\hat{k}^\prime)
e^{-i\omega(\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\boldsymbol{x}-\hat{\boldsymbol{k}^\prime}\boldsymbol{y})}
\end{equation}
after a contraction on appropriate tensors which describe the detectors. Without entering in the details of the calculation, we see that the value of the previous correlation is influenced by two effects.

First of all, the detectors will not be in the same position. In this case the phase factor in the integral will oscillate, and the correlation will be reduced. It is clear that this reduction will start when the separation between the two detectors will be larger than the wavelength of the field at the frequency of interest.  In the very high-frequency regime, this will happen at very small separations, $d \gtrapprox 1/(2\pi f)$.

A further reduction of the correlation can be generated by two detectors which are coupled differently to the modes, for example because they are oriented differently.

The reduction of correlation is quantified by the so--called `overlap function' $\gamma (f)$, a frequency dependent factor with modulus always less than 1, which is simply the coherence between the two signal of interest. In a quantitative analysis $\gamma(f)$ must be included so as to diminish the signal correlation and increase the minimum detectable amplitude by a factor $\frac{1}{\gamma(f)}$. Michelson~\cite{Michelson} has worked through the derivation of $\gamma(f)$ and Allen \cite{Allen} has outlined the process of optimising the detection efficiency by optimal filtering in the time domain for two detectors with arbitrary separation and orientation.

\subsubsection{Exploiting $\gamma(f)$ at very high-frequencies}

One possibility that arises at high-frequencies due to the small wavelength of the radiation being studied is to construct laboratory scale detectors which in principle could be moved relative to one another, hence changing the value of the overlap function $\gamma$. In this way the correlation of the signal can be modulated, and a detection of this modulation pattern could provide credible evidence of a relic radiation detection. It is interesting to note that the overlap reduction function depends on the polarization structure of the field. This means that by looking at the modulation pattern it is in principle possible to disentangle non standard polarizations coming from extended gravitational theories.

\subsubsection{Signal switching}
\label{subsec:switch}

The prospect of a new detection technology for high-frequency GW detection opens a window for a slightly novel form of correlation detector. Instead of correlating the output signal with that of a similar detector, it may be possible to turn off the sensitivity of a single detector to GWs without affecting its other performance properties. If the temporal pattern of switching on and off can be seen in the signal output at a statistically significant level then a credible claim for a detection might be made.

An opportunity of this kind presents itself for correlation detection in the case of magnetic conversion detectors (see below), in which case signal switching could also be achieved by modulating the amplitude of the field and its direction. The devices are arranged to enable the conversion of the GW to an electromagnetic one within an electromagnetic cavity crossed by a strong magnetic field. The electromagnetic signal produced is proportional to the length of the cavity in GW wavelengths and the cavity dimensions transverse to its length are critical in determining the efficiency of the process. This is because the generated electromagnetic wave finds itself travelling in an electromagnetic waveguide, with a phase velocity greater than that of the GW. To make the conversion efficient these two phase velocities must be sufficiently close that, in the whole length of the detector, only a very small phase difference develops between the two waves. If this is not the case then the conversion process is essentially rendered inoperative. Current thoughts on slowing the electromagnetic wave in the cavity include the introduction of a gas into the cavity and adjusting the refractive index at the electromagnetic frequency by means of the pressure to equalise the phase velocities. Because the conversion is so inefficient if this is not done, controlling the gas pressure can essentially switch the sensitivity to GWs off and on with very minimal disturbance to its other operating parameters and hence to the output signal. The detector output can then be correlated with the detector operating pattern. Statistically, this is a more effective correlation process than described above between two similar detectors because in this case the signal is compared with an a priori determined template and not a random template. The minimum detectable signal in this case is $\propto T^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ allowing a faster gain in sensitivity with time.


\subsubsection{Issues related to data acquisition and long term storage}

To detect correlated periodic events in nearby detectors at frequencies around 1 MHz at an signal-to-noise ratio of 8, systematic errors related to timing should be of the order of 20 ns. This necessitates the need for a careful understanding of the various factors that contribute to errors arising from timing calibration. From the hardware side, low noise amplifiers, anti-aliasing electronics, etc. add delay to the data acquisition system. Quantization errors arising from the analog-to-digital converters add further delay and to minimize the effect, their sampling period would have to be made lower than the desired timing resolution. At such sampling rates, making use of super-conducting oversampling ADCs which achieve high dynamic ranges over narrow frequency ranges by pushing quantization noise outside the band-of-interest could turn out to be viable option.

Both stochastic and continuous wave analysis rely on cross-correlation based search strategies and make use of year long data-sets for their analysis. Moving from current audio-band frequencies to megahertz regime can easily scale up the storage requirements to few petabytes of data. However it must be noted that the increase of storage is not proportional to the frequency of interest, but on the bandwidth, as the typical observation frequency can always scaled down with an appropriate heterodyne technique.

This calls for real-time analysis as proposed in SKA where the raw data is discarded after the low latency retrieval of relevant information. Advantages of using cloud and web 2.0 technologies for the collaborative development of the various data analysis pipelines used for signal detection and parameter estimation also needs to be investigated. Making use of data folding techniques based on inherent symmetries, such as Earth's siderial day rotation has been shown to decrease data volume in stochastic background searches at audio-band frequencies~\cite{PhysRevD.92.022003}. Stacking years long data into a single day while preserving all the statistical properties would enable us to carry out the final analysis on personal computing devices.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The search for high-frequency gravitational waves is a promising and challenging search for new physics. It provides a unique opportunity to test many theories beyond the Standard Model that could not be tested otherwise.

Various models proposed to address open questions in particle physics and cosmology predict a gravitational wave signal in the frequency range $f \simeq (10^3 -  10^{10})\,$Hz, which could be a coherent signal - e.g.\ from mergers of compact objects or from axion superradiance around black holes - or stochastic - e.g.~originating from certain models of cosmic inflation, from a phase transition in the very early Universe or from oscillons, evaporating primordial black holes, etc. See Figs.~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} and~\ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary} as well as Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-coherent} and Tab.~\ref{tab:summary-stochastic} for an overview. Many of these models can lead to relatively large signals, corresponding to an ${\cal O}(1)$ fraction of energy density in the early Universe converted to gravitational waves. This energy is red-shifted in the expanding Universe, rendering even these strong signals challenging to detect today. Moreover, in many cases the amplitude of the signal depends sensitively on the model parameters and may be significantly lower in large parts of the model parameter space.

The high-frequency band comes with particular challenges and opportunities. High-frequency gravitational waves carry a high-energy density, implying that bounds provided by cosmology on the fraction of energy contained in gravitational waves translate to stringent bounds on the characteristic gravitational wave strain. This poses a severe challenge for detection, since the magnitude of any observable effects is typically governed by the strain and not by the energy density. This renders the detection of cosmological sources of high-frequency gravitational waves much more challenging than comparable searches at lower frequencies. On the other hand, the lack of known astrophysical gravitational wave sources in this frequency range poses a unique opportunity for foreground free searches of new physics.

At the moment, there is no general consensus on the most promising detection strategy in this frequency band, though many proposals have been put forward in the past decades. The proposals that we are aware of are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:SummarySensitivity}, together with their frequency and sensitivity range. We emphasize that the same sensitivity (in terms of characteristic strain) at a higher frequency typically implies a reduced sensitivity to the viable parameter space of a given cosmological source, as discussed above. In this sense, detectors based on magnetic conversion or on the deformation of microwave cavities seem to be particularly promising avenues, though a more careful study of noise levels and of the margin on improvement with foreseeable technology development is needed in many cases.

We hope that this document will stimulate the necessary discussion and we strongly encourage feedback regarding further proposals or critical assessments which we may have missed. We have the ambition to consider this document as a first step towards a coherent international collaboration to seriously consider the search for high-frequency gravitational waves.

None of the proposals listed in this report currently reach the sensitivity needed to probe the new physics outlined above. At best, achievable proposals are still at least six orders of magnitude beyond the required sensitivity. However, we recall that, one hundred years ago, the technological gap in both the LIGO and LISA frequency ranges was of about $16$ orders of magnitude~\cite{Chen:2016isk}. Also, less than 50 years ago, Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, declared that `\textit{such detectors have so low sensitivity that they are of little experimental interest}'~\cite{Misner:1974qy}, referring to laser interferometers. The first laser interferometer gravitational wave detector, built by Robert Forward at Hughes Research Laboratories in the 1970's~\cite{PhysRevD.17.379} had a sensitivity which was eight orders of magnitudes below the design sensitivity of the currently operating LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. There are currently clear development paths leading to detectors operating at sensitivities of $h_{c, n} \simeq 10^{-26}$ using e.g.\ magnetic conversion (see Sec.~\ref{sec:inv_gertsenshtein}) and several new ideas such as magnon devices and superconducting systems which have received little detailed design development so far.

We therefore take the past history of laser interferometry as an encouraging lesson for the development of gravitational wave detectors in the high-frequency band. The challenges are strong but the opportunities are unique. As a rule of thumb, probing very early epochs of our cosmic history and consequently particle physics at very high-energy scales requires searching for gravitational waves at high-frequencies with correspondingly small experimental devices. As can be seen from Fig.s~\ref{fig:hc_stochastic_summary} and \ref{fig:hc_coherent_summary}, the Ultra High-Frequency band, ranging from the MHz to the GHz is an exciting window to explore fundamental physics up to the grand unification or string theory scales of order $(10^{16}-10^{17})$~GeV, thereby probing our cosmological history right up to the Big Bang. A detection of a gravitational wave signal in this frequency range would be smoking gun signal for new physics, since no known astrophysical processes can generate sizable gravitational wave signals at these frequencies. It would be remarkable if the experimental test of fundamental physics at the highest energies and earliest times in the history of the Universe could eventually be achieved not with huge particle accelerators nor satellite interferometry, but with small size table-top experiments.

This white paper set up the stage for the launch of the Ultra-High-Frequency Gravitational Wave (UHF-GW) initiative\footnote{Check out the \href{http://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/activities/UHF-GW.php}{\underline{website}} of the initiative.}, that supports the creation of a network of researchers for the development of gravitational wave science in the high-frequency range. One of the goals of the initiative is to stimulate the technological development that is needed to build successful gravitational wave detectors at high-frequency.

\section{The non-abelian homogeneous gauge field background \label{sec:background}}

In this section we study the classical evolution of the homogeneous non-abelian gauge-field background. In Sec.~\ref{subsec:Isotropic} we discuss three distinct types of solutions. Among these, of particular interest is the ``$c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type'' of solution which, in physical coordinates, describes a background gauge field whose magnitude, for any fixed $\xi$, approaches a positive constant. This is similar to the background field assumed in CNI (see~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2012st,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka}). (In comoving coordinates, the background field grows in proportion to the scale factor $a(\tau)$, or equivalently\footnote{For the time scales we are considering, $H$ is effectively constant.} in proportion to $(-\tau)^{-1}$.) We will show that this solution is only possible for $\xi\geq2$, and it is stable under perturbations. The key result of this section is to describe the initial conditions necessary to reach this type of solution. To this end, we discuss the different types of solutions both at early and at late times. We close \prettyref{subsec:Isotropic} by showing a phase-space diagram of these solutions, illustrating the different types of solutions as well as their behaviour at early and late times. Based on this in-depth study of the non-equilibrium behaviour of the classical equation of motion we will conclude that 
\begin{itemize}
\item Once the magnitude of the initial conditions reaches a particular threshold, the classical equation of motion for the gauge field background evolves with high probability towards a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type homogeneous and isotropic background solution. 
\end{itemize}
These initial conditions in turn are understood to be sourced by the enhanced gauge field fluctuations generated before this $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution developed. We will return to these quantum fluctuations in \prettyref{sec:linearized}. For now, we will only note that in the far past, these fluctuations are well described by the abelian limit discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian}.

The analysis of Sec.~\ref{subsec:Isotropic} will assume an isotropic gauge field background. We will justify this in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields} by demonstrating that the homogeneous background evolves towards isotropy. We will further see in Secs.~\ref{sec:linearized} and \ref{sec:example}, that this background suppresses the quantum gauge field fluctuations. We therefore conclude that after the homogeneous background is triggered, the dynamics of the gauge field background are accurately captured by the \emph{classical} equation of motion for a homogeneous and isotropic gauge field.

We conclude this discussion in Sec.~\ref{subsec:dynamical_background} by including the dynamical evolution of the inflaton background. Technical details and mathematical proofs are relegated to Appendices~\ref{app:sec3} and \ref{app:gaugefields}.

\subsection{\label{subsec:Isotropic}Equation of motion for an isotropic gauge field background}

In this section, we consider in detail the equation of motion for the non-abelian gauge field background $A^{(0)}$. (For context, see the discussion around \prettyref{eq:background_plus_linear}.) This is the zeroth order part of our approximation, so we ignore for now the inhomogeneous first-order perturbations $\delta A$ which we will add later in Sec.~\ref{sec:linearized}. We make the following explicit assumptions on the background field: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The background gauge field $A^{(0)}$ is homogeneous and isotropic. (We will show in \prettyref{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields} that isotropy is a valid assumption in our regime of interest. For a discussion on homogeneity in the abelian limit, see \prettyref{sec:abelian}.) 
\item The inflaton field $\phi$ is homogeneous and evolves in the slow-roll regime. In particular, we consider $\xi$ to be constant. (See~\prettyref{eq:rev_xi} and the subsequent comments.) 
\end{itemize}
Any $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge field $A^{(0)}(\tau)$ which is homogeneous and isotropic is (after applying a gauge transformation) of the form (see e.g.~\cite{Verbin:1989sg,Maleknejad:2012fw}),
\begin{equation}
(A^{(0)})_{0}^{a}=0,\quad(A^{(0)})_{i}^{a}=f(\tau)\,\delta_{i}^{a}.\label{eq:ansatz-A}
\end{equation}
We provide a rigorous proof of this statement as \prettyref{thm:isotropy} in \prettyref{app:iso-gauge}. We emphasize that although this particular choice of $A^{(0)}$ happens to be in temporal gauge, no gauge-fixing constraints have been imposed on $A^{(0)}+\delta A$. 

The corresponding equation of motion for $f(\tau)$ is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\tau^{2}}ef(\tau)+2\left(ef(\tau)\right)^{3}-\frac{2\,\xi}{-\tau}(ef(\tau))^{2}=0,\label{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}
\end{equation}
obtained by inserting \prettyref{eq:ansatz-A} into \prettyref{eq:eq_motion_final}. Our task is now to analyze the qualitative behaviour of solutions to this ordinary differential equation, where $e$ and $\xi$ are constants.

It is helpful to observe the following symmetries of this equation. 
\begin{itemize}
\item There is always a factor of $e$ wherever $f(\tau)$ appears. Consequently, we focus our analysis on the quantity ``$ef(\tau)$'' instead of ``$f(\tau)$.'' The coupling constant $e$ is nothing but a scale factor. 
\item The substitution 
\begin{align*}
ef(\tau) & \mapsto-ef(\tau)\\
\xi & \mapsto-\xi
\end{align*}
preserves solutions of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. Thus solutions with $\xi<0$, are identical (up to a sign) to solutions with $\xi>0$. As in \prettyref{sec:abelian} we assume without loss of generality that $\xi\geq0$. 
\item \label{enu:symmetry}For any positive real number $\lambda$, the transformation 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)\mapsto\lambda\,ef(\lambda\tau)\label{eq:symmetry3}
\end{equation}
preserves solutions of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. The most straightforward consequence is that in \prettyref{fig:scaling-symmetry}, we may replace the axis labels $(\tau,ef(\tau))$ by $(H_{*}\tau,H_{*}^{-1}ef(\tau))$ for any constant $H_{*}$. For instance, one might take $H_{*}$ to be the value of the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation. Alternatively, for convenience, in this section (and this section only) we will work in units where $\tau$ and $ef(\tau)$ are dimensionless.\\
More generally, this transformation can be understood in terms of the physical quantity $g(N)$ defined as follows:  
\begin{equation}
g(N)\equiv-\tau\,ef(\tau),\ \textrm{ where }\tau=\tau_{0}\,e^{N},\ \textrm{and}\ \tau_{0}\equiv\tau(N=0).\label{eq:g-def}
\end{equation}
Here $N$ is the usual measure of e-folds during inflation with $dN=-Hdt=d\tau/\tau$, so that \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} becomes 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}N^{2}}g(N)-3\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}N}g(N)+2g(N)\left(g(N)^{2}-\xi g(N)+1\right)=0\,.\label{eq:g-of-N}
\end{equation}
This is an autonomous \footnote{\emph{Autonomous} means that the time variable doesn't explicitly appear in the equation of motion. For example, the quartic oscillator equation $w''(x)+2w(x)^{3}=0$ is autonomous, while the Airy equation $w''(x)-xw(x)=0$ is not. } equation, so solutions are invariant under time translations of the form $g(N)\mapsto g(N+\ln\lambda)$. With comoving quantities, these time translations correspond precisely to the transformation~\eqref{eq:symmetry3}. When this transformation is applied in the limit $\lambda\to0^{+}$, it corresponds to the limiting behaviour as $\tau\to0^{-}$ (i.e.\ to the infinite future). As part of our analysis in the next subsection, we illustrate in \prettyref{fig:scaling-symmetry} how the transformation acts on the both the comoving quantity $ef(\tau)$ and physical quantity $g(N)$. Note that Refs.~\cite{Adshead:2012kp,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka} work directly with the physical gauge field background. When studying the infinite future it is more convenient to work with $g(N)$, otherwise we find it more convenient to study $ef(\tau)$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Three distinct types of solutions\label{subsec:solutions}}

\subsubsection*{Typical behaviour of solutions }

Before rigorously analyzing the behaviour of solutions, we begin with an informal discussion of the two most common types of solution to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. Typical examples of these are depicted as solid black lines in \prettyref{fig:scaling-symmetry}. Details and proofs will be provided below. 
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering{}\includegraphics{xi1curves}\hfill{}\includegraphics{xi3curves}\\
\includegraphics{xi1curvesg}\hfill{}\includegraphics{xi3curvesg}\caption{\label{fig:scaling-symmetry} Typical solutions for the classical gauge field background. The thicker black curve ($\lambda=1$) is obtained by numerically solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} for specific (but generic) initial conditions. The coloured curves are obtained by applying the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} for various $\lambda$. The top panels show the solutions in comoving coordinates and conformal time. The bottom panels show the same solutions in physical coordinates and e-folds, where \eqref{eq:symmetry3} simply corresponds to a time-shift. (To be definite, we choose $\Delta N$ to denote the number of e-folds before $\tau_{0}=-\tfrac{1}{8}$.) The left panels show a typical example of a $c_{0}$\protect\nobreakdash-type background solution. The right panels show a typical $c_{2}$\protect\nobreakdash-type background solution. In the far future, the bounded $c_{0}$\protect\nobreakdash-type (resp.~growing $c_{2}$\protect\nobreakdash-type) background solutions in comoving coordinates correspond in physical coordinates to decaying (resp.~bounded) solutions.}
\end{figure}

For large negative values of $\tau$ (the far past), solutions for $ef(\tau)$ are typically oscillatory of a fixed amplitude. We caution the reader that in our model, this oscillatory behaviour does not actually occur in the far past. This is because at early times, the gauge field background is dominated by small but growing fluctuations from super-horizon modes, and so the classical equation of motion breaks down there. \label{ref:no-osc}

On the other hand, we shall be primarily concerned with what happens as $\tau\to0^{-}$ (the infinite future), and the influence of the initial conditions on this behaviour. Based on the two parameters which determine the initial conditions, we can divide solutions into three categories based on their behaviour as $\tau\to0^{-}$:
\begin{description}
\item [{$c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type~solutions}] \label{c0typesol} The function $ef(\tau)$ remains bounded, and $ef(\tau)$ converges to a finite value as $\tau\to0^{-}$. In this case, the physical gauge field background $f(\tau)/a(\tau)$ approaches zero and will remain small compared to the tachyonically enhanced gauge field fluctuations, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}. 
\item [{$c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type~solutions}] The function $ef(\tau)$ is unbounded as $\tau\to0^{-}$. In this case, the growth of $ef(\tau)$ is always proportional to $(-\tau)^{-1}$. These are the background solutions which will be most relevant throughout this work, and which are responsible for the inherently non-abelian regime of CNI. The physical gauge field background $f(\tau)/a(\tau)$ approaches a positive constant.
\item [{$c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type~solutions}] These solutions form the ``saddle points'' between $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions. They arise only with finely-tuned initial conditions. Just like $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, their growth is proportional to $(-\tau)^{-1}$ as $\tau\to0^{-}$, however with a smaller proportionality constant. 
\end{description}
Asymptotic formulas for these three families of solutions are given in \prettyref{app:t_to_0}.

Our two central questions are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given initial conditions for a solution to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}, will the solution be $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type or $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type? 
\item For which initial conditions is the solution oscillatory? When so, at what time do the oscillations stop? \label{enu:central-questions} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Ansatz}

We can write down up to three explicit solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} with the ansatz 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=c\,\xi/(-\tau)\,,\qquad\textrm{ equivalently }g(N)=c\,\xi,\label{eq:ansatz-f}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant. Solutions of this form arise by rescaling any general solution of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} to its $\tau\to0^{-}$ limit, namely by applying the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} in the limit as $\lambda\to0$. (This fact is part of \prettyref{thm:bg-future}, and can be readily verified from the formulas of \prettyref{app:t_to_0}.) Indeed, functions of the form of this ansatz are precisely the fixed points of \eqref{eq:symmetry3}.

We obtain a solution to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} when $c$ is one of 
\begin{equation}
c_{0}=0\,,\quad c_{1}=\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\sqrt{1-4/\xi^{2}})\,,\quad c_{2}=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\sqrt{1-4/\xi^{2}})\,,\label{eq:c-definitions}
\end{equation}
motivating the nomenclature for $c_{i}$\nobreakdash-type solutions introduced above. Note that since $f(\tau)$ must be real, the $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ solutions exist only when $\xi\geq2$. In this case, 
\[
0+\xi^{-2}<c_{1}\leq\tfrac{1}{2}\leq c_{2}<1-\xi^{-2}\,,
\]
and asymptotically as $\xi\to\infty$ we have 
\begin{equation}
c_{1}=0+\xi^{-2}+O(\xi^{-4}),\quad c_{2}=1-\xi^{-2}+O(\xi^{-4})\,.\label{eq:c-asymptotics}
\end{equation}
The reader will find it especially useful to keep in mind that $c_{2}\approx1$ for large $\xi$.

We shall see in \prettyref{subsec:phase-space} that the $c_{0}$ and $c_{2}$ solutions are stable under all small perturbations of the initial conditions. Thus they both have a two-parameter basin of attraction. The $c_{1}$-solution is stable under just one direction of perturbations, so it is just part of a one-parameter family. \prettyref{app:t_to_0} contains explicit asymptotic formulas for these families. The structure of these families is explained in \prettyref{subsec:phase-space}.

The $c_{2}$ solution (which exists only when $\xi\geq2$) plays a central role in our story because it is an explicit stable non-abelian solution: 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=c_{2}\,\xi/(-\tau)=\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+\sqrt{1-4/\xi^{2}}\right)\xi}{-\tau}\,.\label{eq:c2solution}
\end{equation}

\begin{description}
\item [{Note}] We refer to the three particular solutions 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=c_{i}\,\xi/(-\tau),\quad i\in\left\{ 1,2,3\right\} \label{eq:ci-solutions-123}
\end{equation}
respectively as \emph{the $c_{0}$ solution} (or simply \emph{the zero solution}), \emph{the $c_{1}$ solution} and \emph{the $c_{2}$ solution}. In contrast there are three \textbf{families} of $c_{i}$\nobreakdash-\textbf{type} \emph{solutions}, of which the $c_{i}$ solutions are respective members. A $c_{i}$\nobreakdash-type solution approaches the corresponding $c_{i}$ solution in the infinite future. More details on the families of $c_{i}$\nobreakdash-type solutions are given in \prettyref{app:t_to_0}. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Oscillatory behaviour}

We remind the reader that although the oscillatory regime for the classical background field equation \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} which we describe in this subsection extends to the infinite past, our model does not obey this classical equation at early times (see page~\pageref{ref:no-osc}). Nevertheless we will see in this section how the mathematical analysis of the oscillatory regime in the infinite past provides a nice criterion for determining which initial conditions lead to either $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solutions or $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions.

The oscillatory behaviour of solutions is explained by the following theorem: 
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:oscillatory}Any particular solution $ef(\tau)$ to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} has two associated constants: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\omega\geq0$, 
\item $u_{0}\in[0,5.244)$. 
\end{itemize}
These constants depend on the solution, so they are determined once initial conditions are fixed. The solution can be written in the form 
\begin{align}
ef(\tau) & =\omega\cdot\mathrm{sn}(\omega\tau+u_{0})+\epsilon(\tau)\,,\label{eq:approx-quartic}
\end{align}
for some function $\epsilon(\tau)$ which is $\mathcal{O}((\xi+\xi^{2})/(-\tau))$ as $\tau\to-\infty$. Here $\mathrm{sn}(u)$ denotes the Jacobi $\mathrm{sn}(u|m)$ function with elliptic parameter $m=-1$ (see \prettyref{app:Jacobi} for details). We recall that the Jacobi $\mathrm{sn}$ function with argument $m$ is periodic with quarter-period given by the complete elliptic integral $K(m)$. The precise range for the periodic parameter $u_{0}$ is thus $[0,4K(-1))$. The constant $\omega$ is always uniquely determined by initial conditions. The constant $u_{0}$ is uniquely determined when $\omega\neq0$. The parameters $(\omega,u_{0})$ transform under \eqref{eq:symmetry3} as 
\begin{equation}
(\omega,u_{0})\mapsto(\lambda\omega,u_{0})\,.\label{eq:ic-transform}
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

Moreover, we have numerically verified the stronger statement that for \emph{all} $\tau$, 
\begin{equation}
\left|\epsilon(\tau)\right|\leq\frac{4\xi}{-3\tau}\,.\label{eq:epsilon-ineq}
\end{equation}
We prove \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} in \prettyref{app:pf-approx-w}. A rigorous proof of \prettyref{eq:epsilon-ineq} is likely possible using similar techniques, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. 

\prettyref{thm:oscillatory} tells us that when $\omega>0$, $ef(\tau)\approx\omega\cdot\mathrm{sn}(\omega\tau+u_{0})$ when $\left|\epsilon(\tau)\right|\ll\omega$. In particular combining this with \prettyref{eq:epsilon-ineq}, oscillation occurs at early times when 
\begin{equation}
\tau\ll-\frac{\xi}{\omega}\,,\label{eq:osc-from-omega}
\end{equation}
which we take as the definition of the oscillatory regime. In the case $\omega=0$, \eqref{eq:epsilon-ineq} implies that $|ef(\tau)|\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau)$ so that there are no oscillations.

We remark that \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} and \prettyref{eq:epsilon-ineq} are consistent with the results obtained from the ansatz~\eqref{eq:ansatz-f}. Namely the $c_{i}$ solutions correspond to $\omega=0$ and $\epsilon(\tau)=ef(\tau)=c_{i}\xi/(-\tau)$. (This satisfies \prettyref{eq:epsilon-ineq} because $\left|c_{i}\right|\leq\tfrac{4}{3}$.) To explain why $\omega=0$ is necessary for the $c_{i}$ solutions, recall that the $c_{i}$ solutions are fixed points of the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3}. Thus by \prettyref{eq:ic-transform} we have $\omega=\lambda\omega$ for all positive $\lambda$, and hence $\omega=0$. 

\prettyref{eq:osc-from-omega} is unfortunately not very practical for determining which initial conditions lead to oscillation, because $\omega$ is difficult to compute from given initial conditions. As a remedy, the following theorem suggests a very simple criterion in terms of initial conditions $ef(\tau_{1})$ and $ef'(\tau_{1})$ at time $\tau_{1}$. It introduces a function $\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ which serves as an approximation to the constant $\omega$. 
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:approx-w}(Criterion for oscillation) Let $ef(\tau)$ be a particular solution to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. Define the associated function 
\begin{align}
\omega_{ef}(\tau) & \equiv\sqrt[4]{(ef'(\tau))^{2}+\left(ef(\tau)\right)^{4}}.\label{eq:omega_ef}
\end{align}
 As explained in \prettyref{app:Jacobi}, this approximates the envelope of $ef(\tau)$ as it oscillates. Then 
\[
\omega\equiv\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{ef}(\tau)
\]
 coincides with the parameter $\omega$ specified in \prettyref{thm:oscillatory}. Furthermore, the solution is oscillatory (i.e.\ $\omega>0$) if there exists any time $\tau_{1}$ such that either 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})>0$ when $0\leq\xi<2$, or 
\item $\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})>\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau_{1})$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

We prove this theorem in \prettyref{app:pf-approx-w}. 

Based on the second bullet point, we identify the transition time $\tau_{1}$ between the oscillatory regime and non-oscillatory regime as occurring when 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt[4]{(ef'(\tau_{1}))^{2}+\left(ef(\tau_{1})\right)^{4}}\approx\frac{4\xi}{-3\tau_{1}}\approx\frac{\xi}{-\tau_{1}}\,.\label{eq:BoundaryOscillatory}
\end{equation}
 This answers the second question of page~\pageref{enu:central-questions}. As will become clear from the discussion in Sec.~\ref{subsec:phase-space}, we can use this to estimate the necessary amplitude of the gauge field fluctuations which is required to trigger a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution.

Here we pause to take account of the two notions of ``oscillatory'' that we have developed so far. Firstly, a solution is, according to \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} and \prettyref{eq:epsilon-ineq}, oscillatory in the far past if the constant $\omega$ associated with the solution is positive. In that case, the solution oscillates when $\tau\ll-\frac{\xi}{\omega}$. Thus $-\omega\tau\sim\xi$ sets the scale for the transition. In contrast, \prettyref{thm:approx-w} provides a particular criterion which is well-suited for checking whether initial conditions at some time $\tau_{1}$ have corresponding solutions which begin in this oscillatory regime: $\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})>\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau_{1})$ with $\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ defined in \prettyref{eq:omega_ef}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering{}\includegraphics{xi1-w1-f}\hfill{}\includegraphics{xi3-w1-f}\\
\includegraphics{xi1-w1-tauf}\hfill{}\includegraphics{xi3-w1-tauf} \caption{\label{fig:omega_eq_1} Systematic study of all possible solutions to the classical background equation~\eqref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} for two different values of $\xi$. All solutions have been normalized to unit amplitude ($\omega=1$) and the phase $u_{0}$ is indicated by colour. The lower panels show the same solutions in physical coordinates. This illustrates that the limiting values of $g(N)$ as $\tau\to0^{-}$ are $c_{i}\xi$, and the value of the phase $u_{0}$ determines which of the $c_{i}\xi$ is reached. The two special $c_{1}$\protect\nobreakdash-type solutions are indicated by thicker lines. The orange vertical line indicates the transition time $\tau=-\xi/\omega$. We have chosen $\Delta N$ to denote the number of e-folds before $\tau_{0}=-10^{-2}$. }
\end{figure}
For solutions with $\omega\neq0$, we may normalize the amplitude of oscillations to $\omega=1$ by applying the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} with $\lambda=\omega^{-1}$. (In terms of the physical quantity $g(N)$, this entails time-shifting the solutions so that they all exit the oscillatory regime at the same point in time.) \prettyref{fig:omega_eq_1} illustrates how the solutions of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} (normalized to $\omega=1$) depend on the remaining free phase parameter $u_{0}$. We note that the upper-left panel with $\xi=1$ does not admit unbounded solutions as $\tau\rightarrow0^{-}$, whereas the upper-right panel ($\xi=3$) admits both bounded and unbounded solutions. The value of $u_{0}$ is colour-coded, and we point out that for $\xi=3$, the $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solutions have colours which range only from orange-red to yellow-green. More precisely, this is the interval $u_{0}\in\left(0.136,1.409\right)$, which is approximately one fourth of the phase range. When $\xi=3$ and the phase $u_{0}$ is random, the probability of a $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solution is 24.3\%, and the probability of a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution is $75.7$\%.

The distinct categories of solutions are particularly evident in the lower panels of \prettyref{fig:omega_eq_1} depicting the physical gauge field amplitude. The limiting values in the infinite future are discrete: 
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:bg-future}When $\xi\neq2$, all solutions of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} satisfy
\[
\lim_{\tau\to0^{-}}-\tau\,ef(\tau)=c_{i}\xi
\]
for some $i\in\left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $, where $c_{i}$ is defined in \prettyref{eq:c-definitions}. Furthermore, the $\lambda\to0$ limit of the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} applied to any solution of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} is the corresponding $c_{i}$ solution. 
\end{thm}

The proof is provided in \prettyref{app:pf-bg-future}, and it uses the machinery developed in \prettyref{subsec:phase-space}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{centering}

The grey and white regions respectively indicate $c_{0}$- and $c_{2}$\protect\nobreakdash-type solutions. This figure illustrates that $c_{0}$\protect\nobreakdash-type solutions are rare when $\xi$ is large. }
\end{figure}
This theorem gives us a way to classify solutions into three distinct categories. Solutions with generic initial conditions are always of type $c_{0}$ or $c_{2}$. Fine-tuning the phase $u_{0}$ to achieve a solution exactly between $c_{0}$ and $c_{2}$ leads to exactly two values of the phase which correspond to ``$c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions.'' The corresponding red and green curves in the lower panels of \prettyref{fig:omega_eq_1} are indicated with thicker lines. The following theorem formalizes the notion that the $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions are the boundary between $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, the proof of which is also provided in \prettyref{app:pf-bg-future}.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:phase-intervals}For each $\xi>2$, there exists exactly two distinct values of $u_{0}$ corresponding to $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions. The two complementary phase intervals correspond respectively to $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions. 
\end{thm}

\prettyref{fig:u0-of-xi} visualizes the phase intervals leading to the respective $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, generalizing the above results to the entire $\xi$-range of interest. We note in particular that for $\xi\gtrsim4$, the $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solutions become highly unlikely for random initial conditions. This will be a crucial ingredient in answering the first question on page~\pageref{enu:central-questions}. 

\subsubsection{\label{subsec:phase-space}Phase space diagram}

\subsubsection*{Change of variables }

As we saw in \prettyref{eq:g-def}, there is a change of variables which puts \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} into the form of an autonomous system. Thus the dynamics are captured by a 2-dimensional phase space diagram. This enables us to re-phrase the results obtained in \prettyref{subsec:solutions} in a more intuitive way.

Rather than choose $(g(N),g'(N))$ as phase space coordinates, we find the following choice more convenient: 
\begin{equation}
q(\tau)\equiv-\tau\,ef(\tau)\,,\quad p(\tau)\equiv(-\tau)^{2}ef'(\tau)\,.\label{eq:cov}
\end{equation}
The equations of motion under these new coordinates then become 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}\tau}=\frac{p(\tau)-q(\tau)}{-\tau},\quad\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}\tau}=\frac{-2\left(q(\tau)^{3}-\xi\,q(\tau)^{2}+p(\tau)\right)}{-\tau}\,.
\]
The denominator of $-\tau$ can be eliminated via the substitution $\mathrm{d}\tau=\tau\,\mathrm{d}N$, rendering the system autonomous: 
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}N} & =q-p\,,\quad\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}N}=2(q^{3}-\xi\,q^{2}+p)\,.\label{eq:q-p-eom}
\end{align}
Just as for the physical quantity $g(N)$ defined in \prettyref{eq:g-def}, the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} also acts on $q(N)$ and $p(N)$ as $N$-translation 
\begin{equation}
N\mapsto N+\ln\lambda\,.\label{eq:lambda-time-translation}
\end{equation}

This differential equation is solved by the flow lines of the vector field 
\begin{equation}
\left(q-p,2\left(q^{3}-\xi\,q^{2}+p\right)\right)\,,\label{eq:vec-field}
\end{equation}
in the $q$-$p$ plane.

We now begin a complete classification of solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} based on an analysis of this vector field \eqref{eq:vec-field}. For simplicity we exclude the degenerate case when $\xi=2$ exactly.

The zeroes of this vector field are readily verified to be 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c}_{i}\equiv\left(q,p\right)=\left(c_{i}\xi,c_{i}\xi\right),\label{eq:ci-points}
\end{equation}
for $c_{i}$ defined in \eqref{eq:c-definitions}, and the corresponding constant trajectories are, up to the change of variables \eqref{eq:cov}, the $c_{i}$ solutions of \prettyref{eq:ci-solutions-123}. Therefore for $\xi<2$, $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ is the unique zero of \eqref{eq:vec-field}. As $\xi$ passes through the value $2$, the pair of zeroes $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ is created at the point $(1,1)$. Thus for $\xi>2$ there are three zeroes in total. The zeroes at $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ are stable, while $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ is a saddle point. Thus the stable trajectories of $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ form two-parameter families, while the stable trajectories of $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ form only a one-parameter family. These families correspond to the ``$c_{i}$\nobreakdash-type solutions'' described on page~\pageref{c0typesol}.

\subsubsection*{Visualizing solutions with a phase-like diagram}

Using the change of variables from \prettyref{eq:cov}, we can visualize the structure of solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} in a very effective manner. Solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} can be plotted as trajectories in the $q$-$p$ plane. Two solutions parameterize the same trajectory if and only if they are related by a shift in the time variable $N$ according to \prettyref{eq:lambda-time-translation}. In the first row of \prettyref{fig:trajectories-panel} we plot various such trajectories. Since the phase $u_{0}$ defined by \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} is invariant under \eqref{eq:symmetry3}, each trajectory has a well-defined phase which is indicated by colour in the first row of \prettyref{fig:trajectories-panel}, with the same colour coding as in Fig.~\ref{fig:omega_eq_1}. Oscillation is represented by the spirals in the top right panel of \prettyref{fig:trajectories-panel}. Solutions spiral inwards along a trajectory of fixed colour, and each crossing of the $p$-axis corresponds to a zero of the solution.

\begin{figure}
\centering{}\includegraphics{rainbowpanel} \caption{\label{fig:trajectories-panel} Evolution of the background gauge field in phase space, depicted by trajectories of the vector field \prettyref{eq:vec-field} for $\xi=3$. The dots are zeroes of the vector field, corresponding to the $c_{i}$ solutions of Sec.~\ref{subsec:solutions}. The left column shows the non-oscillatory regime around the zeroes, whereas the right column is a zoomed-out view showing the oscillatory regime. The second row shows some special trajectories, the third row depicts contours of constant $-\omega\tau$. See the text for further details.}
\end{figure}

Already at this point, since no two trajectories are allowed to cross, we observe that the boundary between the basins of attraction for $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ is given precisely by the two trajectories of $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions (plus of course their limit point $\mathbf{c}_{1}$.) These are depicted as red and green lines in the second row of Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectories-panel}.

We can construct a natural coordinate system on the $q$-$p$ plane by taking a coordinate complementary to the phase $u_{0}$. The complementary invariant $\omega$ of solutions is not a suitable candidate, because it transforms nontrivially under \eqref{eq:symmetry3} according to \prettyref{eq:ic-transform}. The quantity $-\omega\tau$ is however invariant under \eqref{eq:symmetry3}, and level curves are shown in the last row of \prettyref{fig:trajectories-panel} (with a spacing of $N/10$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:g-def}). For a given trajectory, these level curves correspond to fixed-time contours, and hence the speed of approach to the respective $c_{i}$ solution is encoded in the spacing of these level curves. The contour $-\omega\tau=\xi$ is highlighted in orange, indicating the transition between the oscillatory and the non-oscillatory regime (see \prettyref{eq:osc-from-omega}). Moreover, we indicate the level curves of $D(N)^{1/4}$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:def-D}) as dashed lines, showing the excellent agreement between $-\omega\tau$ and the auxiliary function $D(N)^{1/4}$ in the oscillatory regime. These dashed level curves accumulate to the level curve $D(N)=0$, which plays a key role in the analysis of \prettyref{app:sec3}.

The resulting coordinate system is degenerate at $\omega=0$. In the left panel of the middle row of Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectories-panel}, we show the $\omega=0$ solutions corresponding to the two ``instanton-type'' trajectories (vacuum-to-vacuum transitions which tunnel from the $c_{1}$ solution in the infinite past to either the $c_{0}$ solution or $c_{2}$ solution in the infinite future) as grey curves. The asymptotic formula for the corresponding solutions is \prettyref{eq:instanton-type} with $\rho>0$ and $\rho<0$ respectively. These instanton-type solutions, together with all the $c_{i}$ solutions (which are the limit points), are all of the only non-oscillatory ($\omega=0$) solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}.

The black curves are contours of constant $-\omega\tau$. }
\end{figure}

In this way, we understand the structure of all the solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} and how they fit together. The results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:rainbow}, which simply combines the first and last row of Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectories-panel}.

We see how if generic initial conditions are chosen to be oscillatory, they will spiral inwards towards either $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ or $\mathbf{c}_{2}$. Finally, recall from \prettyref{fig:u0-of-xi} that $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ is favoured, overwhelmingly so as $\xi$ increases. This explains why Eq.~\eqref{eq:BoundaryOscillatory} can be used as a criterion for the required magnitude of the initial conditions necessary to trigger a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution.

We note that $c_{1}\approx0$ for large $\xi$, and hence the basin of attraction for $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ actually comes very close to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$. Thus it is quite likely that the abelian gauge field fluctuations will trigger a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution even before the oscillatory regime is entered. But given that the fluctuations grow exponentially with $\xi$, it is sufficient to simply have an order-of-magnitude estimate for the transition time. From \prettyref{eq:BoundaryOscillatory} we conclude that the transition occurs when 
\begin{equation}
e\langle A_{\text{ab}}^{2}\rangle^{1/2}\sim\xi/(-\tau).\label{eq:transition-time}
\end{equation}
  

\subsection{Anisotropic background gauge fields \label{subsec:Anisotropic-background-fields}}

Until now, throughout our analysis of the homogeneous background we have assumed isotropy, so that
\begin{equation}
(A^{(0)})_{i}^{a}=\delta_{i}^{a}\,f(\tau).\label{eq:iso-bg}
\end{equation}
 Here we study the effect of anisotropies in the background gauge field, assuming de-Sitter space. (Note that anisotropic CNI cosmologies have been studied e.g. in \cite{Maleknejad:2013npa}.) We verify that all anisotropies of a homogeneous gauge-field background decay (in physical coordinates) into one of the previously-studied isotropic solutions. 

First we show there are no anisotropic analogues of the $c_{i}$ solutions. Next we consider homogeneous anisotropic perturbations of \eqref{eq:iso-bg} to linear order. Finally, as a non-perturbative verification, we numerically solve the full nonlinear equations of motion for a homogeneous anisotropic background. This justifies our previous assumption of isotropy.

\subsubsection*{No anisotropic steady states }

We make the anisotropic analogue of our ansatz \prettyref{eq:ansatz-f}, namely 
\begin{equation}
e\,(A^{(0)})_{i}^{a}(\tau)=C_{i}^{a}\xi/(-\tau)\,.\label{eq:ansatz-aniso}
\end{equation}
\prettyref{eq:eq_motion_final} yields the following equations: 
\begin{equation}
(2\xi^{-2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{3}^{2})\sigma_{1}-2\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}=0\textrm{ and cyclic permutations,}\label{eq:svdansatz}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$ and $\sigma_{3}$ are the singular values of $C_{i}^{a}$. As can be verified by solving this with a computer algebra system, the only real solutions are equivalent to the three isotropic solutions we already found in \prettyref{eq:ansatz-f}.

\subsubsection*{Anisotropic perturbations of the background gauge field to linear order }

We wish to consider first-order perturbations of \prettyref{eq:iso-bg} which are anisotropic, and thus of the form 
\[
(A^{(0)})_{i}^{a}=f(\tau)\delta_{i}^{a}+P_{i}^{a}(\tau)\,\epsilon+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2})\,.
\]
 As explained in \prettyref{app:global-symmetries}, we may decompose $P_{i}^{a}$ into irreducible representations of the diagonal $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ subgroup of $\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{gauge}}\times\mathrm{SO}(3)_{\mathrm{spatial}}$ as 
\[
P_{i}^{a}=s(\tau)\delta_{i}^{a}+v^{j}(\tau)\varepsilon_{ija}+T_{i}^{a}(\tau).
\]
 Since $f(\tau)$ already accounts for the diagonal degree of freedom, we impose that $s(\tau)=0$. We now substitute this ansatz into our twelve equations of motion. It's implicit here that the three $(A^{(0)})_{0}^{a}$ components are determined by the equation of motion (as constraint equations). Expanding out the remaining nine equations of motion, we obtain \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}, together with the rank-five equation for the perturbations 
\begin{align*}
T''+\frac{2\xi}{-\tau}ef(\tau)\,T & =0\,.
\end{align*}
We find no equations of motion involving $v^{j}(\tau)$, indicating that they are the gauge degrees of freedom. Accordingly, the remaining three equations are equivalent to $0=0$.

In the case of the $c_{0}$-solution $f(\tau)=0$, the general solution is $T(\tau)=T_{0}+\tau T_{1}$ so that $T(\tau)\to T_{0}$ as $\tau\to0^{-}$. The corresponding physical quantity thus decays as $(-\tau)T_{0}+\mathcal{O}(\tau^{2})$ as $\tau\to0$. 

In any $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution, as the isotropic component $f(\tau)$ grows in the positive direction, WKB theory dictates that $T$ decays in proportion to $\left(-\tau^{-1}f(\tau)\right)^{-1/4}$ (see \prettyref{eq:exp-approx}). Thus when $ef(\tau)$ is any $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution, $T$ decays in proportion to $\sqrt{-\tau}$, and the corresponding physical quantity decays as $(-\tau)^{3/2}$. In the case of the $c_{2}$ solution, the exact solution for $T(\tau)$ is 
\begin{align*}
T(\tau) & =T_{0}\sqrt{-\tau}\exp\left(\pm i\,\mu_{2}\log(-\tau)\right)+\textrm{h.c}\,,\\
\mu_{2} & \equiv\xi\sqrt{2c_{2}-(2\xi)^{-2}}\,,
\end{align*}
where $T_{0}$ is a complex symmetric traceless tensor determined by the initial conditions.

\subsubsection*{Numerical solutions of full nonlinear anisotropic background}

We showed above that any homogeneous background solution which has anisotropies at sub-leading order must evolve towards isotropy. While this supports the hypothesis that any homogeneous background tends toward isotropy, it does not prove anything about highly anisotropic backgrounds. For this we resort to numerical simulation. Specifically, we numerically solve the fully anisotropic\footnote{For the fully anisotropic case, while one may diagonalize the spatial components of $A(\tau_{\mathrm{ini}})$ at the initial time $\tau_{\mathrm{ini}}$, the spatial components of $A(\tau_{\mathrm{ini}})$ and $A'(\tau_{\mathrm{ini}})$ are not simultaneously diagonalizable.} system \prettyref{eq:eq_motion_final} for the twelve functions\footnote{We have twelve functions $(A^{(0)})_{\mu}^{a}$ subject to three constraint equations and six independent dynamical equations. To get a well-formed system, one must add three gauge-fixing constraints. We found it convenient to impose temporal gauge $\left(A^{(0)}\right)_{0}=0$.} $(A^{(0)})_{\mu}^{a}$ which determine the background field $A^{(0)}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering{}\subfigure{ \includegraphics{xi3-c2-iso-tri} } \hfill{}\subfigure{ \includegraphics{xi3-c2-iso-plot} } \caption{\label{fig:c2-iso} A $c_{2}$\protect\nobreakdash-type solution with random anisotropic initial conditions evolving towards isotropy for $\xi=3$. Left panel: the positively orientated isotropic configuration corresponds to the top-right corner. Right panel: For the same parameter point, time evolution (relative to an arbitrary time $\tau_{*}$) of the quantities $D$, $E$ and $F$ as defined in the text. The horizontal lines denote the asymptotic values $1$ and $c_{2}\approx0.87$ characterizing an isotropic $c_{2}$ solution. }
\end{figure}

In order to understand the resulting numerical solutions, we need a way to visualize their properties. As a generalization of $ef(\tau)$ to the non-isotropic case, we define for any nonzero $3\times3$ matrix $A$: 
\begin{align}
F(A)\equiv\frac{-\tau|A|}{\sqrt{3}\xi}\ \textrm{ where }|A|\equiv\sqrt{A_{i}^{a}A_{i}^{a}}.\label{eq:F-norm-fn}
\end{align}
Then in the special case that $A^{(0)}$ is isotropic, $F(A^{(0)}(\tau))=-\tau\left|ef(\tau)\right|/\xi$. Thus if $A^{(0)}$ corresponds to an isotropic $c_{i}$\nobreakdash-type solution, then $\lim_{\tau\to0^{-}}F(A^{(0)}(\tau))=c_{i}$ in accordance with \prettyref{thm:bg-future}. Next we must quantify the degree to which $A^{(0)}$ is anisotropic. We define in \prettyref{app:quant-aniso} two further parameters $D(A)$ and $E(A)$ for this purpose, which are invariant under rotation, gauge symmetry, and multiplication by a positive scalar. Up to a normalization factor, $D(A)\in\left[-1,1\right]$ is $(\det A)/\left|A\right|^{3}$, while the definition of $E(A)$ is more involved. The pair of values $(D(A),E(A))$ determines a point in the triangular-shaped region in the left panel of \prettyref{fig:c2-iso} (see also \prettyref{fig:DE-triangle}). The matrix $A$ is isotropic when $D(A)=\pm1$, or equivalently when $E(A)=1$. When $D(A)=+1$ (resp.\ $-1$) the gauge field is positively (resp.\ negatively) oriented.\footnote{We say that an isotropic gauge field $A_{i}^{a}=f(\tau)\delta_{i}^{a}$ is \emph{positive} when $f(\tau)$ is positive. This has the following physical significance. An isotropic gauge field identifies an orthonormal basis of the Lie algebra with $|f(\tau)|$ times an orthonormal basis of 3-space (via contraction). The Lie algebra carries a natural orientation where the structure constants are $+i\varepsilon^{abc}$. For 3-space, the chiral term in our Lagrangian picks out a preferred orientation (which corresponds to the standard orientation when $\xi>0$). The relative orientation thus is the sign of $\xi f(\tau)$. Since we assume $\xi>0$, the relevant sign is that of $f(\tau)$.}

In \prettyref{fig:c2-iso} we show a typical example of a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution with random anisotropic initial conditions evolving towards isotropy. As expected for all $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, $(D,E)\to(1,1)$ in the infinite future, indicating positively-oriented isotropy. (In contrast, $(D,E)$ need not approach $(1,1)$ for $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solutions since $F(A)\to0$ and zero is isotropic.) In our numerical simulations, we observe that within a few e-folds, all solutions converge towards an isotropic solution of the form \prettyref{eq:ansatz-aniso}, namely either a $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solution or a $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solution. The proportion of $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions was even higher than predicted in \prettyref{fig:u0-of-xi}. We conclude that 
\begin{itemize}
\item the $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions are stable against small anisotropic perturbations; 
\item sufficiently large anisotropic initial conditions with $\xi>2$ usually lead to $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions; 
\item the continuous sourcing of the background field through the enhanced abelian super-horizon modes will therefore inevitably lead to an isotropic $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type background solution. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Inflationary model building is notoriously hard due to the difficulty to protect the flatness of the inflationary direction against potentially large quantum corrections of different origin. This problem is particularly severe for models with observable tensor modes since they generically require the inflaton to travel over a trans-Planckian distance during inflation \cite{Lyth:1996im}. The most promising way-out is based on the presence of symmetries which forbid dangerous corrections to the inflaton potential. 

These symmetries can only be postulated at the effective field theory level but can instead be derived if inflation is embedded within the framework of a consistent UV theory like string theory \cite{McAllister:2007bg, Baumann:2009ni, Cicoli:2011zz, Burgess:2013sla}. From this point of view, the inflaton is the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with these symmetries which need to be slightly broken in order to generate the inflaton potential. The small breaking parameter suppresses higher dimensional operators which can spoil the flatness of the inflaton potential. The two main symmetries used for inflationary model building are compact axionic shifts \cite{Westphal:2014ana,Pajer:2013fsa} and non-compact rescaling symmetries for volume moduli \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. 

These symmetries have allowed the realisation of several very promising mechanisms to drive inflation in string compactifications. However some of these mechanisms rely mainly on local constructions which lack a full global realisation in terms of moduli stabilisation. This is crucial to have full control over the inflationary dynamics since it determines the properties of all directions orthogonal to the inflaton and fixes all the mass and energy scales in the model. On top of moduli stabilisation, other important issues to trust inflationary models building are the study of the post-inflationary cosmological history starting with reheating \cite{Green:2007gs, Brandenberger:2008kn, Barnaby:2009wr, Cicoli:2010ha} and the interplay between inflation and other phenomenological implications of the same model like the supersymmetry breaking scale \cite{Conlon:2008cj, He:2010uk, Antusch:2011wu, Buchmuller:2014pla}, the nature of dark matter \cite{Acharya:2008bk, Allahverdi:2013noa, Aparicio:2015sda} and dark radiation \cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Hebecker:2014gka, Cicoli:2015bpq} or the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry \cite{Kane:2011ih, Allahverdi:2016yws}. 

Some string inflation models admit a global realisation with moduli stabilisation but only within the context of an effective supergravity description which assumes the existence of a particular Calabi-Yau background and a suitable form of the superpotential and the K\"ahler potential that define the theory. This is for example the state-of-the-art of fibre inflation models \cite{Burgess:2016owb} where inflation is driven by a K\"ahler modulus and the final prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is between $0.01$ \cite{Cicoli:2016chb} and $0.006$ \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. In this case, the underlying Calabi-Yau manifolds is assumed to have a fibration structure so that the overall internal volume is controlled by two cycles, the base and the fibre. At leading perturbative order beyond the tree-level approximation, only the overall volume develops a mass while the fibre modulus remains exactly massless. This makes this field a perfect candidate to drive inflation. The perturbative corrections which depend on the fibre modulus and generate its potential are subdominant because of supersymmetry \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. Moreover the flatness of the fibre modulus potential is protected by an effective shift symmetry associated with the underlying no-scale structure of type IIB compactifications. Even if this symmetry is approximate, since it is broken by loop effects, it is still sufficient to suppress higher dimensional operators \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. 

In this paper we make these inflationary models more robust by embedding them in concrete Calabi-Yau manifolds with an explicit choice of orientifold involution and brane setup which is globally consistent and can, at the same time, reproduce the form of the inflationary potential of fibre inflation models. 
We first derive the topological conditions on the underlying Calabi-Yau manifold which are imposed by the requirement of a successful moduli stabilisation and inflationary mechanism. This singles out Calabi-Yau manifolds with at least $h^{1,1}=3$ that feature a K3 or $T^4$ fibration over a ${P}^1$ base and a shrinkable rigid (del Pezzo) divisor \cite{Cicoli:2008va, Cicoli:2011it}. We therefore perform a systematic scan through the Kreuzer-Skarke list of toric Calabi-Yau three-folds \cite{Kreuzer:2000xy} to find those with the required structure and find $45$ different examples. We then choose different orientifold involutions and D3/D7 brane setups which satisfy tadpole cancellation conditions and have the right structure to generate the typical potential of fibre inflation models via both string loop \cite{Berg:2005ja, Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp} and higher derivative $\alpha'$ corrections to the effective action \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. In the end we perform a detailed analysis of these global models showing that all K\"ahler moduli can be fixed inside the K\"ahler cone and inflation can take place successfully. 

This is the first viable realisation of fibre inflation models in explicit Calabi-Yau orientifold constructions which are globally consistent. This definitely represents an important step forward in our understanding of string inflationary models even if further work in the future is needed. In fact, we shall show that Calabi-Yau examples with $h^{1,1}=3$ are not rich enough to allow non-trivial gauge fluxes on D7-branes which would generate a chiral visible sector. The minimal case which can potentially lead to a global embedding of fibre inflation with a visible chiral sector requires $h^{1,1}=4$. We leave the study of this case for the future. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec2}, after a brief review of the main features of fibre inflation scenarios, we outline the strategy that we shall follow to build viable global models. We then describe the topological and model building requirements of our constructions and present the results of our search through the Kreuzer-Skarke list of toric Calabi-Yau three-folds. We finally explain how we choose the orientifold involution and brane setup and how we compute the resulting string loop corrections to the 4D scalar potential. In Sec. \ref{ExplEx} we then present concrete global models in explicit Calabi-Yau examples with $h^{1,1}=3$. More explicit global examples are described in App. \ref{App}.


\section{Global embedding of fibre inflation}
\label{sec2}

Before presenting our strategy to realise a viable global embedding of fibre inflation models, let us start by reviewing the main features of these inflationary models.

\subsection{A brief review}
\label{Review}

Successful realisations of fibre inflation models require `weak Swiss-cheese' Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-folds whose volume form does not completely diagonalise and in general looks like:
\begin{equation}
{V} = f_{3/2}\left(\tau_j\right) - \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}} \lambda_i \tau_i^{3/2}\qquad\text{with}\qquad i\neq j=1,...,h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small}\,,
\label{WSC}
\end{equation}
where $f_{3/2}\left(\tau_j\right)$ is a homogeneous function of degree $3/2$. After fixing at semi-classical level all complex structure moduli and the dilaton by turning on background fluxes \cite{Giddings:2001yu}, the K\"ahler moduli-dependent K\"ahler potential and superpotential are taken of the form:
\begin{equation}
K = -2\ln {V} + K_{\alpha'} + K_{g_s} \qquad \text{and} \qquad W = W_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}} A_i\,e^{-a_i T_i}\,,
\end{equation}
where ${V}$ is the Einstein-frame CY volume in string units, $K_{\alpha'}$ is an ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ correction which depends just on the overall volume ${V}$ \cite{Becker:2002nn, Minasian:2015bxa, Bonetti:2016dqh}, $K_{g_s}$ contains both ${O}(g_s^2 \,\alpha'^2)$ and ${O}(g_s^2 \,\alpha'^4)$ string loop effects which depend on all $T$-moduli \cite{Berg:2005ja, Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp}, while $W_0$ is the flux superpotential which can be considered as constant after complex structure and dilaton stabilisation. 

According to the general LVS moduli stabilisation procedure, $N_{\rm small}$ blow-up modes plus the overall volume mode get stabilised at leading order giving rise to an AdS vacuum by the interplay of non-perturbative effects in $W$ and ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections to $K$ \cite{Cicoli:2008va}. This leaves $N_{\rm flat} = h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small} - 1$ flat directions which can naturally drive inflation and develop a potential at subleading order by either ${O}(g_s^2 \,\alpha'^4)$ string loop corrections \cite{Berg:2005ja, Berg:2007wt, Cicoli:2007xp} or higher-derivative $F^4\,{O}(\alpha'^3)$ effects \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}.

Note that ${O}(g_s^2 \,\alpha'^2)$ corrections to $K$ contribute effectively to the scalar potential as ${O}(g_s^4 \,\alpha'^4)$ effects since their leading order contribution cancels off because of supersymmetry \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. This crucial cancellation for inflationary model-building has been name `extended no-scale structure' and can be traced back to the presence of an approximate non-compact shift symmetry \cite{Burgess:2014tja}.

A particularly simple situation arises when $N_{\rm small}=h^{1,1}-2$ since it leads to just $N_{\rm flat} = h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small} - 1 = 1$ flat direction. In this case, the general expression for the CY volume (\ref{WSC}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \lambda   \sqrt{\tau_1}\,\tau_2 - \sum_{i = 1}^{h^{1,1} - 2} \lambda_i \tau_i^{3/2}\,,
\label{eq:VolumeNflat1}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_1$ is the volume of a ${T}^4$ or a K3 fibre over a $\P^1$ base whose volume is given by $t_1=\lambda\tau_2/\sqrt{\tau_1}$ \cite{Math}. Trading the large modulus $\tau_2$ for ${V} \simeq \lambda \sqrt{\tau_1}\, \tau_2$ and working order by order in a large volume expansion, the dominant contribution to the scalar potential at ${O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$ can be schematically written as:
\begin{equation}
V_{{O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)} = V_\LVS({V}, \tau_i) + V_\dS({V})\,, \quad  \quad i = 1, \dots, N_{\rm small}\,.
\label{eq:PotentialOrder3}
\end{equation}
In the last expression, $V_\LVS({V}, \tau_i)$ is generated by non-perturbative and ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ effects and gives rise to standard LVS vacua which clearly leave $\tau_1$ unfixed at this level of approximation. The order of magnitude of the LVS potential is \cite{Cicoli:2008va}:
\begin{equation}
V_\LVS ({V},\tau_i) \simeq \left(\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\right) \frac{\xi W_0^2}{g_s^{3/2} {V}^3} \,,
\label{eq:VLVS}
\end{equation} 
where $\xi$ is an ${O}(1)$ topological quantity. $V_\dS$ is instead a model-dependent term which contributes to the vacuum energy and can give rise to a dS solution by properly tuning flux quanta. Its microscopic origin can involve anti-branes \cite{Kachru:2003aw} (for recent progress see \cite{antiDdS}), non-perturbative effects at singularities \cite{Cicoli:2012fh} or T-branes \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx}. 

The flat direction parameterised by $\tau_1$ can drive inflation if it is lifted at subleading order by additional perturbative corrections to $K$ which generate a new contribution $V_{\rm inf}(\tau_1) \ll V_\LVS ({V},\tau_i)$.\footnote{Non-perturbative corrections to $K$ are negligible in the region where the EFT is under control \cite{Cicoli:2008va}.} The two main effects which can generate $V_{\rm inf}$ are string loop and higher derivative corrections which we briefly discuss below.

\subsubsection{String loop corrections}

Despite the fact that open string 1-loop corrections have been computed explicitly only in simple toroidal cases \cite{Berg:2005ja}, their dependence on K\"ahler moduli for a generic CY manifold has been carefully conjectured in \cite{Berg:2007wt}. In Einstein frame, 1-loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential take two different forms \cite{Berg:2007wt}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Kaluza-Klein loops:} \quad K^\KK_{g_s} &=& g_s \sum_i \frac{C_i^\KK t_i^{\perp}}{{V}} \,, 
\label{LoopCorrKkk} \\
\text{Winding loops:} \quad K^\W_{g_s} &=& \sum_i \frac{C_i^\W}{{V}\, t_i^{\cap}}\,.
\label{LoopCorrKw}
\end{eqnarray}
Kaluza-Klein (KK) corrections can be seen in the closed string channel as arising due to the exchange of KK modes between stacks of non-intersecting D3/D7-branes and/or O3/O7-planes. In (\ref{LoopCorrKkk}) $t_i^\perp = a_{ij} t_j$ are the 2-cycles transverse to the stack of parallel D-branes/O-planes. On the other hand, winding corrections can be seen as due to the exchange between stacks of intersecting D-branes/O-planes of closed strings wound around non-contractible 1-cycles at the intersection locus. Accordingly, in (\ref{LoopCorrKw}) $t_i^{\cap} = b_{ij} t_j$ are the 2-cycles where D-branes/O-planes intersect. Moreover, $C_i^\KK$ and $C_i^\W$ are unknown flux-dependent coefficients which can be treated as constants after complex structure and dilaton stabilisation.
 
It is useful to keep track of the order at which these corrections arise both in the $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ expansion. $K_{g_s}^\KK$ is an ${O}\left(g_s^2 \alpha'^2\right)$ effect while $K^\W_{g_s}$ appears at ${O}\left(g_s^2 \alpha'^4\right)$.\footnote{The $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ dependence can be worked out by rewriting the corrections to $K$ in terms of the string frame dimensionful volume ${\rm Vol}_s$ by performing the substitution ${V} \rightarrow {\rm Vol}_s/\left(\alpha'^3 g_s^{3/2}\right)$.} However, the leading KK contribution to the scalar potential vanishes due to the extended no-scale structure, and so the first KK loop correction arises only at ${O}\left(g_s^4 \alpha'^4\right)$ and looks like \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK = \left(\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\right) g_s^2 \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2} \sum_{ij} C_i^\KK C_j^\KK K_{ij} \,,
\label{VgsKK}
\end{equation} 
where $K_{ij}$ is the tree-level K\"ahler metric. Being an ${O}\left(g_s^4 \alpha'^4\right)$ effect, (\ref{VgsKK}) behaves effectively as a 2-loop KK effect. On the other hand, the leading winding contribution to the scalar potential is non-vanishing and reads \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W = -2 \left(\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2} \, K_{g_s}^\W \,.
\label{VgsW}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Higher derivative effects}

The 10D type IIB action for bulk fields receives $\alpha'$ corrections which start contributing at ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ and are encoded in several eight-derivative operators:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm IIB}^{10D} = S_0 + \alpha'^3 \, S_3 + \dots\,,
\end{equation}
where the dots indicate the presence of subleading corrections for bulk fields, as well as additional terms related to local sources. $S_3$ denotes a set of eight-derivative operators which can be schematically written as:
\begin{equation}
S_3\sim \frac{1}{\alpha'^4} \int d^{10}x \, \sqrt{-g} \left[{R}^4 + {R}^3 \left(G_3^2 + ..\right) + {R}^2 \left(G_3^4 + ..\right) + {R} \left(G_3^6 + ..\right) + \left(G_3^8 + ..\right) \right],
\label{8DerivOper}
\end{equation}
where $G_3$ is the type IIB 3-form flux, while the dots in each bracket stand for all possible combinations of fluxes giving rise to an operator with the proper number of derivatives. The second term in (\ref{8DerivOper}), gives rise to the following contribution in the scalar potential \cite{Becker:2002nn}:\footnote{The contribution (\ref{Valpha'}) has been actually derived by first performing a dimensional reduction of the first term in (\ref{8DerivOper}) and then by using supersymmetry arguments.}
\begin{equation} 
V_{\alpha'} = \left(\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\right) \frac{3 \xi W_0^2}{4 g_s^{3/2} {V}^3}\,,
\label{Valpha'}
\end{equation} 
which gives rise to LVS minima due to its interplay with non-perturbative effects and fixes the scale of $V_\LVS({V},\tau_i)$. This term is of order $F^2$, as can be easily inferred from the $W_0$ dependence. The parameter $\xi$ is completely determined by the CY Euler number $\chi(X)=2(h^{1,1}-h^{1,2})$ since $\xi=-\frac{\chi(X) \zeta(3)}{2(2\pi)^3}$ \cite{Becker:2002nn}. Note that genuinely $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections give rise to an effective Euler number by shifting $\chi(X) \rightarrow \chi_{\rm eff} = \chi(X) + 2 \int_X  D_{\rm O7}^3$, where $D_{\rm O7}$ is the two-form dual to the divisor wrapped by the O7-plane \cite{Minasian:2015bxa}. 

In \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}, the authors were able to infer $F^4$ contributions to the scalar potential which arise from the third term in (\ref{8DerivOper}) and for a general CY take the simple form:\footnote{See also \cite{Weissenbacher:2016gey} for four-derivative terms in the absence of background fluxes. These effects should give rise to small corrections to the moduli canonical normalisation, and so we shall neglect them.}
\begin{equation} 
V_{F^4} = - \left(\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\right)^2 \frac{\lambda\,W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2} {V}^4} \sum_{i=1}^{h^{1,1}}\Pi_i t_i \,,
\label{VF4}
\end{equation} 
where $t_i$ are the 2-cycles of the generic CY manifold $X$, while $\Pi_i$ are topological numbers defined as:
\begin{equation} 
\Pi_i = \int_X c_2 \wedge \hat{D}_i \,.
\label{Pii}
\end{equation} 
Here $c_2$ is the CY second Chern class, $\hat{D}_i$ is a basis of harmonic 2-forms such that the K\"ahler form can be expanded as $J = t_i \hat{D}_i$ and $\lambda$ is an unknown combinatorial factor which is expected to be between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$ \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. Note that $\Pi_i \,t_i \geq 0$ in a basis of the K\"ahler cone where $t_i \geq 0$ $\forall i=1,..,h^{1,1}(X)$, implying that all $\Pi_i$ can also be taken as semi-positive definite. 


\subsubsection{Inflationary potentials}
\label{InflationaryModels}

Different combinations of perturbative corrections to $K$ can give rise to a different inflationary potential $V_{\rm inf}(\tau_1)$. In fact, depending on compactification details like intersection numbers, divisor topology, brane setup and choice of gauge fluxes and other microscopic parameters, some of the corrections described above can be absent or irrelevant for the stabilisation of $\tau_1$ and the inflationary dynamics. Let us now briefly describe the main features of the different inflationary models proposed so far within this framework.


\subsubsection*{Fibre inflation: KK and winding loops}

The first attempt to realise inflation in fibred CY manifolds with additional shrinkable divisors is `fibre inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. In this model the remaining flat direction $\tau_1$ is lifted by the inclusion of both KK and winding loop corrections to $K$. On the other hand, the effect of higher derivative $F^4$ terms is neglected. The scalar potential for the canonically normalised inflaton $\phi$ takes the form:\footnote{Here and in the following $\phi$ represents the displacement of the field from the minimum of the potential.}
\begin{equation}
V_\FI \simeq \frac{W_0^2}{\langle {V} \rangle^{10/3}} \left[(3 - R) - 4 \left(1 + \frac{R}{6}\right) e^{- k \phi/2} + \left(1 + \frac{2}{3} R\right) e^{- 2 k \phi} + R \,e^{k \phi} \right]\,,
\label{VFI}
\end{equation}
where $k = 2/\sqrt{3}$ and $R$ is a numerical coefficient which is naturally small since $R\propto g_s^4\ll 1$. The minimum of the potential in $\phi=0$ is generated by the competition between the two negative exponentials in (\ref{VFI}) while the term proportional to $e^{- k \phi/2}$ yields an inflationary plateau which can support slow-roll inflation. For large values of $\phi$ the positive exponential in (\ref{VFI}) causes a steepening of the potential which violates the slow-roll conditions. However, due to the smallness of $R$ in the regime with $g_s\ll 1$ where perturbation theory is under control, the inflationary plateau can naturally produce enough efoldings of inflation. The largest tensor-to-scalar ratio which is possible to get with the spectral index compatible with observations is $r \simeq 0.006$ \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. Note that horizon exit can only occur in the plateau since, if it happened close to the steepening region, the spectral index would become too blue.


\subsubsection*{Left-right inflation: KK loops and higher derivatives}

Ref. \cite{Broy:2015zba} considered the same CY geometry and included $F^4$ higher derivative corrections but neglected winding loops. The resulting inflationary potential contains four terms: two positive KK corrections and two $F^4$ terms whose sign is undetermined. Depending on the sign of these $\alpha'$ effects the potential features an inflationary plateau which can support slow-roll inflation either from left to right or from right to left. Note however that the flatness of the potential tends to be spoiled by dangerous terms which cause a rapid steepening unless one of the two topological quantities controlling $F^4$ terms (see their definition in (\ref{Pii})) is hierarchically smaller than the other by a factor at least of order $10^{-4}$ \cite{Broy:2015zba}. The typical prediction of these generalised fibre inflation models is a relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of the form $r=2 f^2 \left(n_s-1\right)^2$ where $f$ is an effective decay constant controlling the strength of the inflationary plateau generated by the term $e^{-\phi/f}$ \cite{Burgess:2016owb}. Note that in the original fibre inflation model $f=2/k$ \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. 

The two inflationary potentials proposed in \cite{Broy:2015zba} look like:
\begin{equation}
V_\R \simeq V_0 \left(1 - e^{k \phi/2}\right)^2 \qquad \text{and}\qquad V_\L \simeq V_0 \left(1 - e^{- k \phi}\right)^2\,,
\label{VLR}
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{equation}
V_0 \simeq \left(\frac{\lambda}{g_s}\right)^2 \frac{W_0^6}{\langle{V}\rangle^4} \,.
\end{equation} 
In both cases the minimum is due the interplay between $F^4$ and string loop corrections, while the inflationary plateau is generated by higher derivative effects which take different forms in the two potentials in (\ref{VLR}). In terms of inflationary observables, inflation to the right reproduces the same predictions of fibre inflation since $f=2/k$. On the other hand, inflation to the left has $f=1/k$, and so, from the typical $r$-$n_s$ relation of generalised fibre inflation models, it predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio smaller by a factor of $4$. Hence for $50$-$60$ e-foldings and a spectral index compatible with observations, the final predictions for tensor modes are: $r_\R \simeq 0.006$ and $r_\L \simeq r_\R/4 \simeq 0.0015$ \cite{Broy:2015zba}.

\subsubsection*{$\alpha'$-inflation: winding loops and higher derivatives}

Another interesting attempt to realise string inflation in fibred CY manifolds with small blow-up modes is `$\alpha'$ inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. In this model the inflaton $\tau_1$ develops a potential via higher derivative $F^4$ effects and 1-loop winding corrections. KK loop corrections are neglected since they effectively contribute to the scalar potential only at 2-loop order due to extended no-scale cancellation. The inflationary scalar potential takes the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{\alpha'\I} \simeq \frac{W_0^2}{\langle {V} \rangle^3 \langle\tau_1\rangle} \left[\left(1 - e^{- k \phi/2}\right)^2  
-R \left(1- e^{k \phi/2} \right)\right]\,,
\label{Vap}
\end{equation} 
where $\langle\tau_1\rangle$ is the value of the inflaton at the minimum and the coefficient $R$ is given by:
\begin{equation} 
R \simeq \frac{\Pi_2}{\Pi_1} \frac{\langle\tau_1\rangle^{3/2}}{\langle {V} \rangle}\,.
\end{equation} 
If the underlying parameters are chosen to yield an anisotropic compactification at the minimum with $\langle \tau_1\rangle^{3/2}\ll \langle{V}\rangle$, i.e. $\langle \tau_1\rangle\ll \langle\tau_2\rangle$, and the topological quantity $\Pi_2$ is hierarchically smaller than $\Pi_1$, i.e. $\Pi_2\ll \Pi_1$, the coefficient $R$ becomes very small. In the limit $R\to 0$, the potential (\ref{Vap}) represents another example of generalised fibre inflation models with $f=2/k$ where the plateau is generated by winding loops. Hence it reproduces the same predictions of both fibre and left-right inflation, i.e. $r\simeq 0.006$. However, in $\alpha'$ inflation the coefficient of the positive exponential is smaller than in fibre inflation, and so horizon exit can take place also close to the steepening region without obtaining a blue spectral index. In this case the prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio can raise to $r \simeq 0.01$ with $n_s \simeq 0.97$ \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}.


\subsection{Global constructions}

After reviewing the main features of fibre inflation scenarios, we are now ready to describe our strategy to build global inflationary models. Let us start by outlining the general topological and model-building requirements.

\subsubsection{General requirements}

In order to realise a successful embedding of fibre inflation models in globally consistent CY orientifolds, we shall follow the following steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Search through the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) list of toric CY 3-folds \cite{Kreuzer:2000xy} to find those with a fibration structure and at least a shrinkable rigid divisor for LVS moduli stabilisation, i.e. $N_{\rm small}\geq 1$. Requiring in addition at least one flat direction $N_{\rm flat}=h^{1,1}-N_{\rm small}-1\geq 1$, we end up with CY manifolds with Hodge number $h^{1,1}\geq 2+N_{\rm small}\geq 3\,$.

\item Choose an orientifold involution and a D3/D7 brane setup which satisfy both D3- and D7-tadpole cancellation conditions and,\footnote{In the concrete examples of Sec. \ref{ExplEx} we shall not explicitly turn on 3-form background fluxes, and so we will be able to check only the D7-tadpole cancellation condition. However we shall ensure that D3-tadpole cancellation leaves enough space to turn on background fluxes \cite{Cicoli:2011qg}.} at the same time, have enough structure to generate appropriate string loop and higher derivative $\alpha'$ contributions to the scalar potential which can successfully drive inflation.

\item Turn on gauge fluxes on D7-branes to generate a chiral visible sector. 

\item Find a dS vacuum after fixing explicitly all K\"ahler moduli inside the K\"ahler cone.  
\end{enumerate}

If successful, this strategy would lead to the first globally consistent CY orientifold examples with a chiral visible sector and a viable inflationary mechanism together with dS moduli stabilisation. We shall show that CY cases with $h^{1,1}=3$ are not rich enough to satisfy points $(3)$ and $(4)$ above, and so can just lead to a global embedding of fibre inflation models without a chiral visible sector and an explicit dS uplifting mechanism. In order to be able to construct a model where all the points above can potentially be satisfied, one should instead focus on CY cases with at least $h^{1,1}=4$.

\subsubsection{Weak Swiss-cheese CYs}

The simplest scenarios have $N_{\rm flat}=1$ flat direction and $N_{\rm small}=h^{1,1}-2=1$ small blow-up mode which implies $h^{1,1}=3$. These CY examples allow for the realisation of globally consistent inflationary models but are too simple to include a chiral visible sector and an explicit sector responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. In fact, chirality can arise only in the presence of non-vanishing D7 worldvolume fluxes. However these gauge fluxes generate also moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos terms which together with soft term contributions from matter fields can lift at leading order all K\"ahler moduli charged under anomalous $U(1)$s \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. This stabilisation method can have the net effect of generating a dS uplifting contribution \cite{CYembedding} corresponding to a T-brane background \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} but reduces the number of flat directions which can be used to drive inflation. Thus in the $h^{1,1}=3$ case, the only flat direction would become too heavy, and so would not represent anymore a natural inflaton candidate. 

On the other hand, for $N_{\rm small}=h^{1,1}-3$, there are $N_{\rm flat} = h^{1,1}-N_{\rm small}-1=2$ flat directions. Requiring at least $N_{\rm small}=1$ shrinkable divisor, this necessarily leads to CY cases with $h^{1,1}=4$. This situation can now potentially allow for the realisation of inflationary models together with a chiral visible sector and an explicit dS mechanism. In fact, in the presence of chirality, one of the flat directions would be lifted in the process of dS uplifting via D-term driven non-vanishing matter F-terms \cite{CYembedding, Cicoli:2015ylx}, while the other might play the r\^ole of the inflaton. In the $h^{1,1}=3$ case, dS vacua could instead be realised via anti-branes \cite{Kachru:2003aw}. Let us now describe separately these two different situations with $h^{1,1}=3$ and $h^{1,1}=4$ (and $N_{\rm small}=1$) which are both relevant for LVS inflationary constructions.

\subsubsection*{$h^{1,1}=3$ case}

In the $h^{1,1}=3$ case, we shall focus on CY 3-folds $X$ with intersection polynomial of the form:
\begin{equation}
I_3 = a\, D_f\, D_b^2+\, b\, D_s^3\,,
\label{IntPol}
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ are model dependent integers, while $f$, $b$ and $s$ stay respectively for `fibre', `base' and `small'. This terminology is justified by a theorem by Oguiso which states that if the intersection polynomial is linear in a particular divisor $D_f$, then $D_f$ is either a K3 or a ${T}^4$ fibre over a $\P^1$ base \cite{Math}. Moreover (\ref{IntPol}) includes also a shrinkable del Pezzo (dP) 4-cycle $D_s$ suitable to support non-perturbative effects which fix it at small size compared to the overall volume \cite{Cicoli:2008va}. 

Expanding the K\"ahler form $J$ in the divisor basis $\{D_b, \, D_f, \, D_s\}$ as $J = t_f\, D_b+t_b \, D_f+ t_s\, D_s$, the overall volume can be written as:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac{1}{3!}\int_X J \wedge J \wedge J = \frac{a}{2}\, t_f^2\, t_b +\,  \frac{b}{6}\, t_s^3 \,.
\end{equation}
Considering the 4-cycle volume moduli given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_b = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_f} = a\, t_b \, t_f\,, \qquad \tau_f = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_b}=\frac{a}{2}\, t_f^2\,, \qquad \tau_s = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_s}=\frac{b}{2}\,t_s^2\,,
\end{eqnarray}
the CY volume can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
{V} = c_a\,\tau_b\, \, \sqrt{\tau_f} - c_b\,\tau_s^{3/2}\qquad\text{where}\quad c_a= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,a}}>0\quad\text{and}\quad c_b = \frac13 
\sqrt{\frac{2}{b}}>0\,.
\end{equation}
The positivity of ${V}$ when $\tau_s\to 0$ forces the integer $a$ to be positive. Moreover, as we shall see below, the fact that $D_s$ is a dP surface 
ensures $b>0$ while its shrinkability implies the K\"ahler cone condition $t_s <0\,$.

\subsubsection*{$h^{1,1}=4$ case}

The intersection polynomial for fibred CY 3-folds $X$ with $h^{1,1} = 4$ and a shrinkable dP surface looks like \cite{Cicoli:2011it}:
\begin{equation}
I_3 = a\, D_f\, D_{b_1} \, D_{b_2}+\, b\, D_s^3\,.
\end{equation}
Expanding the K\"ahler form $J$ in the divisor basis $\{D_{b_1}, \,D_{b_2},\, D_f, \, D_s\}$ as $J = t_{f_1}\, D_{b_1}+ t_{f_2}\, D_{b_2}+t_b \, D_f+ t_s\, D_s$, the overall volume becomes:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac{1}{3!}\int_X J \wedge J \wedge J = a\, t_{f_1}\, t_{f_2}\, t_b +\,  \frac{b}{6}\, t_s^3 \,.
\end{equation}
The 4-cycle volume moduli read:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{b_1} = a\, t_{f_2} \, t_b\,, \qquad \tau_{b_2} = a\, t_{f_1} \, t_b\,, \qquad \tau_f = a\, t_{f_1} \, t_{f_2}\,, \qquad \tau_s = \frac{b}{2}\, t_s^2\,,
\end{equation}
and so the CY volume can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
{V} = c_a\,\sqrt{\tau_{b_1}\, \tau_{b_2}\, \tau_f} - c_b\, \tau_s^{3/2}\qquad\text{where}\quad c_a= \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}>0\quad\text{and}\quad c_b = \frac13\sqrt{\frac{2}{b}}>0\,.
\label{VoLu}
\end{equation}
The relevance of this type of CY volume for cosmological LVS applications has been recently pointed out in \cite{Burgess:2016owb} since (\ref{VoLu}) is analogous to the volume of the simple toroidal example ${T}^6/(\Z_2 \times \Z_2)$ (${V} = \sqrt{\tau_1\, \tau_2\, \tau_3}$) with the only difference being the addition of a blow-up mode. Note that a K3-fibred CY 3-fold with $h^{1,1}=3$ and volume given by (\ref{VoLu}) with $c_b=0$ has been presented in \cite{Gao:2013pra}.

\subsubsection{Divisor topologies}

As we have seen above, `weak Swiss-cheese' CY 3-folds suitable for LVS cosmological applications are K3 or ${T}^4$ fibrations over a $\P^1$ base with additional shrinkable dP divisors. Before presenting the results of a scan over the KS list for this kind of CY spaces, let us describe more in depth the topological features of dP, K3 and ${T}^4$ surfaces.

\subsubsection*{Del Pezzo divisors}

Del Pezzo divisors are Fano surfaces defined as the algebraic surfaces with ample canonical bundle. These are either dP$_n$ divisors obtained by blowing up $\P^2$ on 8 points ($0 \leq n \leq 8$) or $\P^1 \times \P^1$. Here we shall just consider dP$_n$ surfaces which have the following Hodge diamond:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm dP}_n \equiv
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  0 & & $n+1$ & & 0 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular}\qquad \qquad \qquad \forall \, n =0,1,..,8\,. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
These surfaces are rigid as $h^{2,0}({\rm dP}_n) = 0$ (in particular dP$_0=\P^2$), and do not contain non-contractible 1-cycles since $h^{1,0}({\rm dP}_n) =0$. Del Pezzo divisors can be of two types: diagonal and non-diagonal \cite{Cicoli:2011it}. Note that a diagonal dP divisor $D_s$ is shrinkable since one can always find a divisor basis where the only term involving $D_s$ in the intersection polynomial is $D_s^3$. 

Divisors with the same Hodge diamond as above but with $n>8$ are still rigid but not del Pezzo. We shall denote them as `NdP$_n$' with $n>8$. These surfaces are not genuine local effects, and so intuitively could be thought of as blow-ups of line-like singularities. Thus NdP$_n$ divisors are generically non-diagonal \cite{Cicoli:2011it}.

A necessary condition for $D_s$ to be dP is that its triple self-intersection is positive and intersections of $(D_i \, D_s^2)$-type with $i\neq s$ are either negative or zero:
\begin{equation}
\int_{D_i \cap D_s} \, c_1(D_s) = \int_X D_i \wedge D_s \wedge \left(-c_1({\cal N}_{D_s | X})\right) = - \int_X D_i \wedge D_s \wedge D_s \geq 0 \qquad \forall \, i \neq s\,.
\end{equation} 
Here we have used the fact that the first Chern class of a divisor $c_1(D)$ can be written in terms of the first Chern class of its normal bundle $c_1({\cal N}_{D | X})$ as $c_1(D) = - c_1({\cal N}_{D | X}) = - [D]$ where $[D]$ is the homology class of $D$.

Two important quantities characterising the topology of a divisor $D$ are the Euler characteristic $\chi(D)$ and the holomorphic Euler characteristic $\chi_h(D)$ \cite{Blumenhagen:2008zz}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi(D) &\equiv& \sum_{i=0}^4 {(-1)}^i \, b_i(D)  =  \int_X \, D \wedge\left( D \wedge D + c_2(X) \right)\,, \label{chi} \\
\chi_h({D}) &\equiv& \sum_{i=0}^2 {(-1)}^i \, h^{i,0}(D)  = \frac{1}{12} \int_X \, D \wedge \left(2 \, D\wedge D + c_2(X) \right)\,, 
\label{chih}
\end{eqnarray}
where $b_i(D)$ and $h^{i,0}(D)$ are respectively the Betti and Hodge numbers on the divisor. These two relations also imply:
\begin{equation}
\chi_h(D) = \frac{1}{12}\left(\chi(D) + \int_X D \wedge D \wedge D\right) \,.
\label{eq:chisAndDDD}
\end{equation}
For connected dP divisors, $\chi_h({\rm dP}_n) = 1$ and $\chi({\rm dP}_n) = n+3$ which from (\ref{eq:chisAndDDD}) give: 
\begin{equation}
\int_X \, D \wedge D \wedge D = 9-n\,.
\label{chisAndDDDdPn}
\end{equation}
According to (\ref{chisAndDDDdPn}), $D^3_{|_X}>0$ for a dP$_n$ with $n\leq 8$ (for example $D^3_{|_X} = 9$ implies that $D$ is a dP$_0$), while $D^3_{|_X}\leq 0$ indicates that a rigid divisor is a non-shrinkable NdP$_n$ with $n>8$.

\subsubsection*{K3 and ${T}^4$ surfaces}

K3 and ${T}^4$ surfaces are the only two classes of CY 2-folds. Their Hodge diamonds are:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm K3} \equiv
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  1 & & 20 & & 1 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \qquad \qquad\text{and}\qquad\qquad
		{T}^4 \equiv
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 2 & & 2 & \\
  1 & & 4 & & 1 \\
   & 2 & & 2 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular}\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
As we have seen above, if the CY intersection polynomial is linear in $D_f$, then the CY has the structure of a $D_f$ fibre over a $\P^1$ base \cite{Math}. The condition ${D_f^3}_{|_X}= {D_f^2\,D_i}_{|_X}=0$ $\forall i\neq f$ forces $D_f$ to be either a K3 or a ${T}^4$ divisor. In fact, for $D_f={\rm K3}$ we have $\chi(D_f) = 12 \,\chi_h(D_f) = 24$, while for $D_f={T}^4$ we have $\chi(D_f)=\chi_h(D_f)=0$. Thus in both cases (\ref{eq:chisAndDDD}) implies:
\begin{equation}
\int_X D_f^3 = \chi_h(D_f) - \frac{\chi(D_f)}{12} = 0\,.
\label{eq:fibre1}
\end{equation}
More in general the condition (\ref{eq:fibre1}) is equivalent to require:
\begin{equation}
\quad h^{1,1}(D_f) = 10\, h^{0, 0}(D_f) - 8\, h^{1,0}(D_f) +10\, h^{2,0}(D_f)\,,
\end{equation}
which is satisfied by K3, ${T}^4$ and other topologies. However the additional condition ${D_f^2\,D_i}_{|_X}=0$ $\forall i\neq f$ reduces all possibilities to be either K3 or ${T}^4$ \cite{Math}. In this paper we shall present several K3-fibred CY examples, whereas ${T}^4$ fibrations are mostly realised in toroidal setups. 

\subsubsection{Scanning results}

Following the topological requirements described above, we considered all the $244$ reflexive lattice polytopes of the KS list \cite{Kreuzer:2000xy} which result in $340$ different CY spaces with $h^{1,1} =3$ after considering the maximal triangulations, and performed a detailed scan to look for `weak Swiss-cheese' CY 3-folds suitable for realising the minimal setup of fibre inflation models. 

We found $102$ CY 3-folds which are K3-fibred and admit at least one dP$_n$ divisor (with $0\leq n\leq 8$). Imposing the further condition that this dP$_n$ divisor should be shrinkable, reduces this number to $45$. We did not perform a proper scan for `weak Swiss-cheese' CY 3-folds with $h^{1,1}=4$ which have the potential to include also a chiral visible sector and an explicit dS uplifting mechanism. We leave this search for future work.

\subsubsection{Orientifold involution and brane setup}

In the explicit examples which we will present in Sec. \ref{ExplEx}, we shall always focus on simple orientifold involutions of the form $\sigma: x_i \to -x_i$ which give rise to an O7-plane wrapped around the `coordinate divisor' $D_i$ defined by $x_i = 0$ plus possible additional O3-planes. We shall then choose an appropriate D7-brane setup which cancels D7-tadpoles and, at the same time, generates string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential suitable to support fibre inflation models.

In order to cancel all D7-charges, we shall introduce $N_a$ D7-branes wrapped around suitable divisors (say $D_a$) and their orientifold images ($D_a^\prime$) such that \cite{Blumenhagen:2008zz}:
\begin{equation}
\sum_a\, N_a \left([D_a] + [D_a^\prime] \right) = 8\, [{\rm O7}]\,.
\label{eq:D7tadpole}
\end{equation}
D7-branes and O7-planes also give rise to D3-tadpoles which receive contributions also from background 3-form fluxes $H_3$ and $F_3$, D3-branes and O3-planes. The D3-tadpole cancellation condition reads \cite{Blumenhagen:2008zz}:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = \frac{N_{\rm O3}}{4} + \frac{\chi({\rm O7})}{12} + \sum_a\, \frac{N_a \left(\chi(D_a) + \chi(D_a^\prime) \right) }{48}\,,
\label{eq:D3tadpole}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm flux} = (2\pi)^{-4} \, (\alpha^\prime)^{-2}\int_X H_3 \wedge F_3$ is the contribution from background fluxes and $N_{\rm gauge} = -\sum_a (8 \pi)^{-2} \int_{D_a}\, {\rm tr}\, {\cal F}_a^2$ is due to D7 worldvolume fluxes. For the simple case where D7-tadpoles are cancelled by placing 4 D7-branes (plus their images) on top of an O7-plane, (\ref{eq:D3tadpole}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} =\frac{N_{\rm O3}}{4} + \frac{\chi({\rm O7})}{4}\,.
\label{eq:D3tadpole1}
\end{equation}
As a consistency check for a given orientifold involution, one has to ensure that the right-hand-side of (\ref{eq:D3tadpole1}) is an integer. As explained above, in the explicit examples of Sec. \ref{ExplEx} with $h^{1,1}=3$ we shall not turn on gauge fluxes on D7-branes in order to preserve the flatness of the inflaton direction. Thus we shall always have $N_{\rm gauge}=0\,$. Moreover, we shall not explicitly turn on $H_3$ and $F_3$ fluxes but we will always consider orientifold involutions such that the right-hand-side of (\ref{eq:D3tadpole}) is a positive and large integer. This ensures that D3-tadpole cancellation leaves enough freedom to turn on background fluxes for dilaton and complex structure stabilisation. 

\subsubsection{Computation of string loop effects}
\label{ComputeLoops}

Given a particular choice of orientifold involution and brane setup, the location of D-branes and O-planes determines the K\"ahler moduli dependence of open string 1-loop corrections to the scalar potential. In particular, parallel stacks of D-branes/O-planes induce KK corrections, while winding loop effects arise only in the presence of D-branes/O-planes which intersect over a 2-cycle containing non-contractible 1-cycles \cite{Berg:2007wt}. 

In order to understand which involution and brane setup yields a form of these corrections suitable to drive inflation, we shall first compute the intersection curve $D_i\cap D_j$ between each couple of coordinate divisors $D_i$ and $D_j$ and check if this curve can contain non-contractible 1-cycles, i.e. $h^{1,0}(D_i\cap D_j)\neq 0$. If $D_i \cap D_j = \emptyset$ and both divisors are wrapped by D7-branes/O7-planes, string loop corrections are of KK-type and depend on the transverse direction ($t^\perp$) between the two non-intersecting objects. Even if an explicit determination of such a direction requires a detailed knowledge of the CY metric, we are just interested in its dependence on the K\"ahler moduli which for the particular examples of Sec. \ref{ExplEx} can be easily inferred from very general considerations. 

On the other hand, if $D_i \cap D_j \neq \emptyset$, the volume of the intersection 2-cycle is given by:
\begin{equation}
t^\cap = \int_X J \wedge D_i \wedge D_j\,.
\end{equation}
If both $D_i$ and $D_j$ are wrapped by D7-branes and/or O7-planes, the scalar potential will receive $t^\cap$-dependent winding loop corrections only if $h^{1,0}(D_i\cap D_j)\neq 0$. Finally notice that in the presence of O3-planes, KK corrections always arise due to the exchange of closed KK modes between D7-branes/O7-planes and O3-planes.

	
\section{Explicit global examples}
\label{ExplEx}

In this section, we shall present all the topological and model-building details of global fibre inflation models in explicit CY orientifolds with $h^{1,1}=3\,$.

\subsection{Toric data}

Let us consider the CY 3-fold $X$ defined by the following toric data:
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|ccccccc|}
\hline
     & $x_1$  & $x_2$  & $x_3$  & $x_4$  & $x_5$ & $x_6$  & $x_7$       \\
    \hline
6 & 0  & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0  & 3   \\
8 & 0  & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1  & 4   \\
8 & 1  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1  & 4   \\   \hline
  & dP$_8$  & NdP$_{10}$ & SD$_1$ &  NdP$_{15}$ & NdP$_{13}$ & K3  &  SD$_2$  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{table}
 \noindent
with Hodge numbers $(h^{2,1}, h^{1,1}) = (99, 3)$ and Euler number $\chi(X)=-192$. The Stanley-Reisner (SR) ideal is:
\begin{equation}
{\rm SR} =  \{x_1 x_5,\, x_1 x_6 x_7,\, x_2 x_3 x_4,\, x_2 x_6 x_7,\, x_3 x_4 x_5 \} \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the polytope ID $\#192$ in the CY database of Ref. \cite{Altman:2014bfa}. The intersection polynomial in the basis of smooth divisors $\{D_1, D_6, D_7\}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
I_3={D_1^3+ 9 \,D_7^2\, D_1 -3\, D_7\, D_1^2+ 18\, D_7^2\, D_6+  81\, D_7^3}\,,
\label{I3a}
\end{equation}
while the second Chern class is:
\begin{equation}
c_2 (X) = -\frac{14}{3}\, D_3\, D_7 + \frac23\, D_5\, D_7 +\frac83\, D_7^2\,.
\label{eq:c2a}
\end{equation}
The coordinate divisors are written in terms of the divisor basis as:
\begin{eqnarray}
&  & \hskip-0cm D_2 = D_6 - D_1, \qquad D_3 = \frac13 \left(D_7 -  D_6 \right), \quad \\
& &  D_4  = \frac13 \left(D_7 -  D_6  -3\, D_1 \right),   \qquad D_5 =  \frac13 \left(D_7 -4\,  D_6 + 3\, D_1 \right). \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Coordinate divisors}

A detailed analysis using \texttt{cohomCalg} \cite{Blumenhagen:2010pv, Blumenhagen:2011xn} shows that $D_1$ is a dP$_8$ surface while $D_6$ is a K3. This can also be explicitly seen from the various intersections listed in Tab. \ref{Tab2}.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|ccccccc|}
\hline
     & $D_1$  & $D_2$  & $D_3$  & $D_4$  & $D_5$ & $D_6$  & $D_7$       \\
    \hline
$D_1^2$ & 1  & -1 & -1 & -2 & 0 & 0  & -3   \\
$D_2^2$ & 1  & -1 & -1 & -2 & 0 & 0  & -3   \\
$D_4^2$ & 4  & -2 & -2 & -6 & 0 & 2  & -4   \\
$D_5^2$ & 0  & 2 & -2 & -2 & -4 & 2  & -4   \\
$D_6^2$ & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 0   \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Intersections between coordinate divisors.}
  \label{Tab2}
 \end{table}
 \noindent
For $D_1$, Tab. \ref{Tab2} shows that $D_1^3= 1 >0$ while $D_1^2\, D_i \leq 0$ $\forall\,i \neq 1$. Thus $D_1$ satisfies the necessary condition to be a dP surface. Moreover, from (\ref{chisAndDDDdPn}) we have that $D_1$ is a dP$_8$ surface with $\chi(D_1)=11$ and $\chi_h(D_1)=1$. On the other hand, the divisor $D_6$ satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\int_{D_6}\, c_1(D_6) \wedge i^* D_i = -D_6^2\, D_i = 0\,, \qquad \qquad \forall \, i \neq 6\,.
\end{equation}
In addition, using (\ref{chi}) and (\ref{chih}) we find that $\chi(D_6) =24$ and $\chi_h(D_6) = 2$, signaling that $D_6$ is a K3 surface. Furthermore, $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_5$ are NdP$_n$ divisors which are rigid but not dP surfaces (as introduced in \cite{Cicoli:2011it}). To be more specific, \texttt{cohomCalg} gives the following Hodge numbers:
\begin{eqnarray}
 D_2 \equiv
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  0 & & 11 & & 0 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \qquad  D_4 \equiv
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  0 & & 16 & & 0 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \qquad  D_5 \equiv
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  0 & & 14 & & 0 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Tab. \ref{Tab2} also shows that $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_5$ do not satisfy the necessary condition for being a dP, although they are rigid. Using triple intersection numbers and the general relations (\ref{chi}) and (\ref{chih}), we find $\chi(D_2) = 13$, $\chi(D_4) = 18$, $\chi(D_5) = 16$ and
$\chi_h(D_2) = \chi_h(D_4)=\chi_h(D_5)=1$. Finally, $D_3$ and $D_7$ are two `special deformation' divisors SD$_1$ and SD$_2$ (in the notation of \cite{Gao:2013pra}) with $h^{01} =0$ and $h^{20} \neq 0$ since their Hodge diamonds read: 
\begin{eqnarray}
& & \hskip-0.75cm D_3 \equiv
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  2 & & 29 & & 2 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \qquad \qquad
  D_7 \equiv  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  23 & & 159 & & 23 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular}\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
showing that $\chi(D_3) = 35$ and $\chi(D_7) = 207$.
 
\subsubsection{Volume form}

Using (\ref{I3a}), and expanding the K\"ahler form in the basis $\{D_1, D_6, D_7\}$ as $J = t_1 \, D_1 + t_6 \, D_6 + t_7 \, D_7$, the overall CY volume becomes:
\begin{equation}
{V} =\frac{27}{2} \, t_7^3 +9 \,t_7^2 \, t_6+\frac92 \, t_7^2 \, t_1-\frac32 \,t_7 \, t_1^2+\frac16\,t_1^3\,.
\label{vo1}
\end{equation}
Given that the 4-cycle volume moduli look like:
\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = \frac12\left(t_1 - 3 \,t_7\right)^2\,, \qquad \tau_6 = 9 \, t_7^2\,, \qquad  \tau_7 = \frac{3}{2}\left( 27\, t_7^2 - t_1^2 + 12 t_7 \, t_6 + 6 \, t_7\, t_1\right)\,,
\end{equation}
the overall volume ${V}$ takes the following form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac16 \left( \sqrt{\tau_6} \, (\tau_7-2 \tau_6 + 3 \tau_1) - 2 \,\sqrt{2} \, \tau_1^{3/2}\right) = t_6\tau_6 +\frac23 \,\tau_6^{3/2} -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\,\tau_1^{3/2}\,.
\label{eq:volEx1a}
\end{equation}
This expression for the volume reflects the fact that $D_6$ is a K3 fibre over a $\P^1$ base of size $t_6$ while $D_1$ is a shrinkable dP$_8$ corresponding to a small divisor in the LVS framework. Moreover it suggests to trade the basis element $D_7$ for $D_x =D_7-2 D_6 + 3 D_1$, since the intersection polynomial (\ref{I3a}) would simplify to:
\begin{equation}
I_3 = D_1^3 + 18 \, D_6\, D_x^2\,.
\end{equation}
In turn, expanding the K\"ahler form in the new basis as $J = t_s \, D_1 + t_b \, D_6 + t_f \, D_x$, where $s$, $b$ and $f$ stay respectively for `small', `base' and `fibre', the volume form reduces to the minimal version needed for embedding fibre inflation models:
\begin{equation}
{V} = 9\, t_b \, t_f^2 + \frac16\,t_s^3  = \frac16 \,\sqrt{\tau_f}\tau_b - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\,\tau_s^{3/2} = t_b\tau_f- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\,\tau_s^{3/2}\,,
\label{simpleVol}
\end{equation}
where we have used the following conversion relations in the second step:
\begin{equation}
t_s = - \sqrt{2}\, \sqrt{\tau_s}\,, \qquad t_b = \frac{\tau_b}{6\, \sqrt{\tau_f}}\,, \qquad  t_f = \frac13\,\sqrt{\tau_f}\,.
\label{ttau}
\end{equation}
Let us finally mention that $D_x$ is a connected divisor with the following Hodge numbers:
\begin{eqnarray}
D_x \equiv \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 1 & & 1 & \\
  9 & & 92 & & 9 \\
   & 1 & & 1 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular}, \qquad \chi(D_x) = 108\,.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Brane setups}

Let us now present different globally consistent brane setups which can lead to fibre inflation models. We start by describing possible choices for the orientifold involution.

\subsubsection{Orientifold involution}

We focus on orientifold involutions of the form $x_i \to -x_i$ with $i=1,...,7$ which feature an O7-plane on $D_i$ and O3-planes at the fixed points listed in Tab. \ref{Tab3}. 

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$\sigma$ & O7 & O3  & $N_{\rm O3}$  & $\chi({\rm O7})$ & $\chi_{\rm eff}$     \\
\hline
\hline
$x_1 \to -x_1$ &  $D_1$ & $\{{D_2 D_3 D_7}, {D_2 D_4 D_5}, {D_3 D_5 D_6}, {D_4 D_6 D_7} \}$ & $\{3,2,2,6\}$ & 11 & -190  \\
$x_2 \to -x_2$ &  $D_2$ & $\{{D_1 D_3 D_7}, {D_3 D_4 D_6}, {D_5 D_6 D_7} \}$ & $\{3,2,6\}$ & 13 & -194  \\
$x_3 \to -x_3$ &  $D_3$ & $\{{D_1 D_2 D_7}, {D_2 D_4 D_6}, {D_4 D_5 D_7}\}$ & $\{3,0,2\}$ & 35  & -190 \\
$x_4 \to -x_4$ &  $D_4$ & $\{{D_2 D_3 D_6}, {D_3 D_5 D_7}\}$ & $\{0,2\}$ & 18 & -204  \\
$x_5 \to -x_5$ &  $D_5$ & $\{{D_1 D_2 D_4}, {D_1 D_3 D_6}, {D_3 D_4 D_7}\}$ & $\{2,0,2\}$ & 16 & -200 \\
$x_6 \to -x_6$ &  $D_6$ & $\{{D_1 D_4 D_7}, {D_2 D_5 D_7}\}$ & $\{6,6\}$ & 24 & -192 \\
$x_7 \to -x_7$ &  $D_7$ & $\{{D_1 D_2 D_3}, {D_1 D_4 D_6}, {D_2 D_5 D_6}\}$ & $\{1,0,0\}$ & 207 & -30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Fixed point set for involutions of the form $x_i \to -x_i$ with $i=1,...,7$.}  
\label{Tab3}
\end{table}

The effective non-trivial fixed point set in Tab. \ref{Tab3} has been obtained after taking care of the SR ideal symmetry. Moreover, the total number of O3-planes $N_{\rm O3}$ is obtained from the triple intersections restricted to the CY hypersurface, while the effective Euler number $\chi_{\rm eff}$ has been computed, using (\ref{chi}) and (\ref{chih}), as $\chi_{\rm eff} = \chi(X) + 24 \, \chi_h ({\rm O7}) - 2 \, \chi({\rm O7})$. We now focus on two different kinds of D7-brane setups which satisfy the D7-tadpole cancellation condition (\ref{eq:D7tadpole}):
\begin{itemize}
\item D7-branes on top of the O7-plane: in this case string loop effects simplify since winding corrections are absent due to the fact that there is no intersection between D7-branes and/or O7-planes.

\item D7-branes not (entirely) on top of the O7-plane: in this case $g_s$ corrections to the scalar potential can potentially involve also winding loop effects which are crucial to drive inflation in most fibre inflation models.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Tadpole cancellation}

Let us now present some explicit choices of brane setup which satisfy the D7-tadpole cancellation condition for different orientifold involutions.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 1}: we focus on the involution $\sigma: x_3 \to -x_3$ with an O7-plane wrapping $D_3$. D7-tadpole cancellation is satisfied via the following brane setup:
\begin{equation}
8 [{\rm O7}] = 8 \left( [D_2] + [D_5]\right) \,,
\end{equation}
implying that two stacks of D7-branes wrap $D_2$ and $D_5$. The condition for D3-tadpole cancellation (\ref{eq:D7tadpole}) instead becomes:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = \frac{N_{\rm O3}}{4} + \frac{\chi({\rm O7})}{12} + \sum_a\, \frac{N_a \left(\chi(D_a) + \chi(D_a^\prime) \right) }{48} = 9\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
which leaves some (even if little) space for turning on both gauge and background fluxes for complex structure and dilaton stabilisation. 

\item \textbf{Case 2}: we consider the involution $\sigma: x_6 \to -x_6$ with an O7-plane on $D_6$. The D7 tadpole condition can be satisfied by placing 4 D7-branes (plus their images) on top of the O7-plane:
\begin{equation}
8 [{\rm O7}] =8 [D_6]\,.
\end{equation}
Thus D3-tadpole cancellation takes the form: 
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = 9\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
leaving again some freedom to turn on gauge and 3-form fluxes.

\item \textbf{Case 3}: the involution $\sigma: x_7 \to -x_7$, which results in an O7-plane wrapping $D_7$, can give rise to a larger freedom for switching on background fluxes since $\chi(D_7) = 207$. The D7-tadpole cancellation condition can be satisfied by: 
\begin{equation}
a)\qquad 8 [{\rm O7}] = 8\, \left(3\, [D_3] + [D_6] \right)\,,
\end{equation}
with two stacks of D7-branes wrapping $D_3$ and $D_6$. Hence D3-brane tadpoles can be cancelled if:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = 39\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
showing that the contribution to the total D3-brane charge from background fluxes can indeed be larger in this case. The involution $\sigma: x_7 \to -x_7$ and D7-tadpole cancellation allow also for many other different choices for the brane setup such as:
\begin{eqnarray}
b) \qquad 8 [{\rm O7}] &=& 8\left(3\, [D_2] +3\, [D_5]  + [D_6] \right)
\qquad\qquad\Rightarrow\quad N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge}  = 36\,, \nonumber\\ \\
c) \qquad 8 [{\rm O7}] &=& 8\left(2\, [D_2] + [D_3] +2\, [D_5]  + [D_6] \right)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge}  = 37\,, \nonumber\\ \\
d) \qquad 8 [{\rm O7}] &=& 8\left([D_2] + 2\, [D_3] + [D_5]  + [D_6] \right)
\quad\,\,\,\,\Rightarrow\quad N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge}  = 38\,. \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{String loop effects}

Let us now follow the procedure described in Sec. \ref{ComputeLoops} to write down the expression for the string loop corrections to the scalar potential for each brane setup described above. Given that winding loop effects arise due to the exchange of strings wound around non-contractible 1-cycles at the intersection between stacks of D7-branes/O7-planes, we start by listing in Tab. \ref{Tab4} all possible intersections between two coordinate divisors. 

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
  & $D_1$  & $D_2$  & $D_3$  & $D_4$  & $D_5$ & $D_6$  & $D_7$  \\

 $D_4$ & ${C}_2$  &  $2\,\P^1$   &  $\P^1$        &  $6\, \P^1$   &  $\P^1$       &  ${C}_2$    &  ${C}_5$      \\
 $D_5$ & $\emptyset$ &  ${C}_2$  &  $\P^1$        &  $\P^1$       &  $4\,\P^1$    &  ${C}_2$    &  ${C}_5$      \\
 $D_6$ & $\emptyset$ &  $\emptyset$ &  ${C}_2$    &  ${C}_2$   &  ${C}_2$   &  $\emptyset$   &  ${C}_{10}$   \\
 $D_7$ & ${C}_4$  &  ${C}_4$  &  ${C}_{14}$ &  ${C}_5$   &  ${C}_5$   &  ${C}_{10}$ &  ${C}_{82}$   \\
    \hline

  \caption{Intersection curves of two coordinate divisors. Here ${C}_g$ denotes a curve with Hodge numbers $h^{0,0} = 1$ and $h^{1,0} = g$ (hence ${T}^2\equiv {C}_1$), while $n\,\P^1$ indicates the disjoint union of $n$ $\P^1$s.} 
\label{Tab4}
\end{table}

Notice that, whenever the intersection is the disjoint union of $\P^1$s, there is no non-contractible 1-cycle, and so winding loop corrections are absent by construction. 

\subsubsection{Case 1}

This brane setup is characterised by two D7-stacks wrapping $D_2$ and $D_5$ and an O7-plane located at $D_3$. From Tab. \ref{Tab4} we see that all relevant intersections are:
\begin{equation}
D_3 \cap D_5 = \P^1\,, \qquad D_2\cap D_3 = {T}^2\,, \qquad D_2 \cap D_5 ={\cal C}_2\,.
\end{equation}
Thus we can have winding corrections only from the intersection of the D7s wrapping $D_2$ with either the D7s on $D_5$ or the O7 on $D_3$ since a $\P^1$ does not contain non-contractible 1-cycles. The volumes of the corresponding intersection curves read:
\begin{equation}
t^\cap(D_2 \cap D_3) = \int_X J \wedge D_2 \wedge D_3 =  t_s + 6 \, t_f\,,  \quad
t^\cap(D_2 \cap D_5) = \int_X J \wedge D_2 \wedge D_5 = 6 \, t_f\,.  \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Therefore from (\ref{LoopCorrKw}) and (\ref{VgsW}) we have that winding string loop corrections take the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W=-2\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3} \left( \frac{C_1^\W}{6 \, t_f}+\frac{C_2^\W}{t_s + 6 \, t_f} \right)
= -\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3} \left( \frac{C_1^\W}{\sqrt{\tau_f}}+\frac{C_2^\W}{\sqrt{\tau_f}-\sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{2}}} \right)\,.
\label{VW}
\end{equation}
Given that the O7-plane and all D7-branes intersect each other, there are no KK loop corrections induced by parallel O7/D7 stacks. However, as shown in Tab. \ref{Tab3}, the fixed point set includes 3 O3-planes located at $D_1 D_2 D_7$ and 2 O3s at $D_4 D_5 D_7$ on the CY hypersurface. Thus KK $g_s$ effects arise from O7/O3 and D7/O3 combinations which lead to a sum over all basis elements in the general 1-loop KK scalar potential (\ref{VgsKK}). Ignoring terms which depend only on ${V}$ and $\tau_s$ that are fixed at leading order, and neglecting terms which have the same volume scaling as (\ref{VW}) but with additional suppression powers of $g_s^2\ll 1$, we end up with (we focus on the region where $\sqrt{\tau_f}\tau_b\gg \tau_s^{3/2}$):
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK = g_s^2 \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2} \left[\frac{(C_f^\KK)^2}{4\tau_f^2} + \frac{(C_b^\KK)^2 \tau_f}{72 {V}^2} \left(1-6\frac{C_s^\KK}{C_b^\KK} \sqrt{\frac{2\tau_s}{\tau_f}}+ \frac{C_f^\KK}{C_b^\KK} \left(\frac{2 \tau_s}{\tau_f}\right)^{3/2}\right) \right]\,.
\label{VKK}
\end{equation}
Therefore the sum of the two string loop corrections (\ref{VW}) and (\ref{VKK}) to the scalar potential for the brane setup 1 is:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}  = \left[\frac{A}{\tau_f^2}-\frac{1}{{V}\sqrt{\tau_f}}\left(\tilde{B} +\frac{\hat{B}}{1-\sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{2\tau_f}}}\right)+\frac{\tau_f}{{V}^2}
\left(C- \tilde{C} \sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_f}}+ \hat{C} \left(\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_f}\right)^{3/2}\right)\right] \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\,,
\label{VA1}
\end{equation}
where (setting $\kappa \equiv g_s/(8\pi)$):
\begin{eqnarray}
A &=& \frac{\kappa}{4} \left(g_s\,C_f^\KK\right)^2 >0 \nonumber\\ \\
\tilde{B} &=&  \kappa\, C_1^\W \nonumber\\ \\
\hat{B} &=&  - \kappa\, C_2^\W \nonumber\\ \\
C &=& \frac{\kappa}{72} \left(g_s\, C_b^\KK\right)^2 >0 \nonumber\\ \\
\tilde{C} &=&  \frac{\kappa}{6\sqrt{2}}\, g_s^2\,C_s^\KK\,C_b^\KK  \nonumber\\ \\
\hat{C} &=&   \frac{\kappa}{18\sqrt{2}}\,g_s^2\,C_f^\KK\,C_b^\KK\,.  \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
Note that in the region of field space where $\tau_f\gg \tau_s$ the terms in (\ref{VA1}) proportional to $\tilde{B}$, $\tilde{C}$ and $\hat{C}$ are negligible and the loop-generated scalar potential simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}  \simeq \left(\frac{A}{\tau_f^2}-\frac{B}{{V}\sqrt{\tau_f}} +\frac{C\,\tau_f}{{V}^2} \right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\,,
\label{VA1simpl}
\end{equation}
with $B=\tilde{B}+\hat{B}$. This reproduces exactly the inflationary potential of `fibre inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}.

\subsubsection{Case 2}

In this case D7-tadpole cancellation is ensured by placing 4 D7-branes (plus their images) on top of the O7-plane which wraps $D_6$. Thus there is no intersection between the O7-plane and the D7-branes, resulting in the absence of winding loop corrections. Moreover, there are no KK loop effects from the O7/D7 system since the distance between the O7 and the D7 stack is zero. However, the fixed point set has 6 O3-planes at $D_1 D_4 D_7$ and other 6 O3-planes at $D_2 D_5 D_7$, and so KK string loops can arise from the exchange of KK modes between the O7 or the D7s on $D_6$ and the O3s. Since the volume of $D_6$ is given by $\tau_f$, the simple expression for the volume (\ref{simpleVol}) suggests that the distance between the O7/D7s and the O3s is parametrised by the base of the fibration $t_b$. Hence, using (\ref{VgsKK}), KK string loop correction to the scalar potential become:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK = \frac{C\,\tau_f\,W_0^2}{{V}^4} \qquad\text{with}\qquad C = \frac{\kappa}{72}\left(g_s\,C_b^\KK\right)^2 \,.
\label{V2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Case 3}

The brane setup of case ($a$) is characterised by two D7-stacks wrapping $D_3$ and $D_6$ and an O7-plane located at $D_7$. From Tab. \ref{Tab4} we see that all relevant intersections are:
\begin{equation}
D_3 \cap D_6 = {C}_2\,, \qquad D_3\cap D_7 = {C}_{14}\,, \qquad D_6 \cap D_7 ={C}_{10}\,.
\end{equation}
Thus all intersections give rise to curves which contain non-contractible 1-cycles and whose volume takes the form: 
\begin{equation}
t^\cap(D_3 \cap D_6) =  6 \, t_f \,, \qquad 
t^\cap(D_3 \cap D_7) =  3 \, ( t_s + 6 \, t_f + 2\,t_b) \,,  \qquad
t^\cap(D_6 \cap D_7) =  18 \, t_f\,.  \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Therefore from (\ref{LoopCorrKw}) and (\ref{VgsW}) we have that winding string loop corrections take the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W =-\frac23\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3} \left(\frac{3\,C_1^\W+C_2^\W}{6 \, t_f}+\frac{C_3^\W}{t_s + 6 \, t_f + 2\,t_b}\right). 
\label{VW2}
\end{equation}
Working in the limit $t_b\gg t_i$ with $i=f,s$, the previous expression simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W \simeq -\frac13\left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3} \left(\frac{3\,C_1^\W+C_2^\W}{\sqrt{\tau_f}}+\frac{C_3^\W\,\tau_f}{{V}} \right) \,.
\label{VW3}
\end{equation}
Given that the O7-plane and all D7-branes intersect each other, there are no KK loop corrections induced by parallel O7/D7 stacks. However, as shown in Tab. \ref{Tab3}, the fixed point set includes 1 O3-plane located at $D_1 D_2 D_3$ on the CY hypersurface. Thus KK $g_s$ effects arise from O7/O3 and D7/O3 combinations which lead to a sum over all basis elements in the general 1-loop KK scalar potential (\ref{VgsKK}). Thus KK loop effects take the same form as in (\ref{VKK}) where however the term proportional to $C_b^\KK$ can be neglected since it is suppressed with respect to the term proportional to $C_3^\W$ in (\ref{VW3}) by $g_s^2\ll 1$. Hence the total $g_s$ potential for the brane setup 3 is:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s} = V_{g_s}^\W + V_{g_s}^\KK = \left(\frac{A}{\tau_f^2}-\frac{B}{{V}\sqrt{\tau_f}}+\frac{D\,\tau_f}{{V}^2}\right) \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\,,
\label{Vbad}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{eqnarray}
A &=& \frac{\kappa}{4} \left(g_s\,C_f^\KK\right)^2 >0 \nonumber\\ \\
B &=&  \frac{\kappa}{3} \left(3\,C_1^\W+ C_2^\W\right) \nonumber\\ \\
D &=&  - \frac{\kappa}{3}\, C_3^\W\,. \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
A similar form of the string loop scalar potential arises also for the cases ($b$), ($c$) and ($d$) of the brane setup 3. All these cases allow for a larger freedom to turn on background fluxes but generate a winding correction that has a linear dependence on $\tau_f$ without additional suppression factors of $g_s^2$ which are typical instead of KK loop effects like the one proportional to $C$ in (\ref{VA1simpl}). The winding correction proportional to $D$ in (\ref{Vbad}) would therefore cause a steepening of the potential which would destroy the flatness of the inflationary plateau unless the coefficient $C_3^\W$ is unnaturally tuned to very small values. Thus the potential (\ref{Vbad}) is not particularly suitable to support enough e-foldings of inflation. This example illustrates the challenges that one can encounter in the attempts to build globally consistent D-brane models which give rise to appropriate string loop effects to drive inflation. 

\subsection{Higher derivative corrections}

Let us now consider $F^4$ corrections to the scalar potential which can be computed independently on the choice of the orientifold involution and brane setup. The relevant topological quantities which control the size of these higher derivative $\alpha'$ effects are the various $\Pi_i$'s defined in (\ref{Pii}). They turn out to be:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_1 =10 , \quad \Pi_2 = 14 , \quad \Pi_3 =34 , \quad \Pi_4 =24 , \quad \Pi_5 =20 ,\quad  \Pi_6 =24 ,  \quad   \Pi_7 =126 , \quad \Pi_x = 108\,. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Now focusing on $\Pi_1$, $\Pi_6$ and $\Pi_x$, from (\ref{VF4}) the higher derivative scalar potential becomes:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} = - \left(\frac{g_s}{8\pi}\right)^2 \frac{\lambda\, W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}{V}^4} \left(10 \,t_s + 24 \,t_b + 108\, t_f\right)
\simeq \left(\frac{2}{3{V}\,\tau_f}+\frac{\sqrt{\tau_f}}{{V}^2} \right) \frac{F\,W_0^2}{{V}^2}\,,
\label{F4terms}
\end{equation}
where we have neglected the term independent on the fibre modulus $\tau_f$ and: 
\begin{equation}
F = -36 \,\lambda \left(\kappa\, W_0\right)^2 g_s^{-3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the topological quantities $\Pi_x$ and $\Pi_6$ which control the size of the two terms in (\ref{F4terms}) are both of the same order since $\Pi_x/\Pi_6=4.5$. As described in Sec. \ref{InflationaryModels}, left-right inflation models require instead a hierarchy between these two topological quantities at least of order $10^4$ in order to protect the flatness of the inflationary potential. Hence we conclude that this explicit CY example does not satisfy a crucial condition for the realisation of left-right inflation models where the inflationary plateau is developed by $F^4$ terms \cite{Broy:2015zba}. 

\subsection{Inflationary dynamics}

The only case whose scalar potential is rich enough to yield an interesting inflationary dynamics is case 1. In fact, in case 2 the string loop potential (\ref{V2}) contains just a single KK contribution and the two $F^4$ terms in (\ref{F4terms}) do not feature the right hierarchy to realise left-right inflation. Moreover in case 3 the scalar potential (\ref{Vbad}) contains a dangerously large winding loop term which depends linearly on $\tau_f$, and so would very quickly destroy the flatness of the potential unless its coefficient is tuned to unnaturally small values. 

We shall therefore focus on the scalar potential of case 1 and show that it can lead to a viable realisation of both `fibre inflation' and `$\alpha'$ inflation' models. The total scalar potential is given by the sum of the loop induced contribution (\ref{VA1}) and the $F^4$ terms (\ref{F4terms}). In the region of field space where $\tau_f \gg \langle \tau_s \rangle$, this scalar potential simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{g_s} + V_{F^4} = \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2} \left[\frac{A}{\tau_f^2}- \frac{B}{{V} \sqrt{\tau_f}} \left(1-\frac{U}{\sqrt{\tau_f}}\right) + \frac{C \tau_f}{{V}^2}  + \frac{F \sqrt{\tau_f}}{{V}^2}\right]\,.
\label{infpot1}
\end{equation}
where (for $C_\W \equiv C_1^\W - C_2^\W$):
\begin{equation}
|U| = \frac{2|F|}{3B} = \frac{3}{\pi} \frac{|\lambda| \, W_0^2}{C_\W\sqrt{g_s}} \sim {O}(|\lambda|) \ll 1\,,
\end{equation}
for natural values $C_\W\sim W_0\sim{O}(1)$, $g_s\sim{O}(0.1)$ and $|\lambda|\sim{O}(10^{-3})$ \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. The term proportional to $U$ is therefore suppressed by both $|U|\ll 1$ and $\tau_f\gg 1$, and so it can be safely neglected (it would just slightly shift the position of the minimum). Hence the final form of the inflationary potential is:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm inf} = \frac{A\,W_0^2}{{V}^2} \left(\frac{1}{\tau_f^2}- \frac{C_1}{{V} \sqrt{\tau_f}} + C_2 \frac{\tau_f}{{V}^2} + C_3 \frac{\sqrt{\tau_f}}{{V}^2}
\right),
\label{infpot2}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
C_1 = \frac{B}{A}=\left(\frac{2}{C_f^\KK}\right)^2\frac{C_\W}{g_s^2} \qquad C_2 = \frac{C}{A}=\frac 12 \left(\frac{C_b^\KK}{3 C_f^\KK}\right)^2 \qquad
C_3 = \frac{F}{A}=-\frac{162 \,\lambda}{\pi\,g_s^{5/2}} \left(\frac{W_0}{3 C_f^\KK}\right)^2 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
For $g_s\lesssim{O}(0.1)$ and $|\lambda|\sim{O}(10^{-3})$ and natural ${O}(1)$ values of $W_0$ and the coefficients of the string loop effects, the terms in (\ref{infpot2}) proportional to $C_2$ and $C_3$ are both negligible with respect to the $C_1$-dependent term in the region where $1\ll \tau_f\ll\tau_b$ since:
\begin{equation}
\frac{C_2\,\tau_f/{V}^2}{C_1/({V} \sqrt{\tau_f})} = \frac{\left(C_b^\KK\right)^2}{C_\W}\frac{g_s^2}{12} \frac{\tau_f}{\tau_b} \ll 1\,,
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\frac{|C_3|\,\sqrt{\tau_f}/{V}^2}{C_1/({V} \sqrt{\tau_f})} = \frac{972 \,\lambda}{\pi\,C_\W\,g_s^{1/2}} \left(\frac{W_0}{6}\right)^2  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau_f}}\frac{\tau_f}{\tau_b} \ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore the interplay between the first two terms in (\ref{infpot2}) gives a minimum of the inflationary potential for $1\ll \tau_f\ll\tau_b$ which is located at:  
\begin{equation}
\langle \tau_f \rangle \simeq \left(\frac{4}{C_1}\right)^{2/3}{V}^{2/3}\sim g_s^{4/3} \,{V}^{2/3}\ll {V}^{2/3}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad 1\ll\langle \tau_f \rangle\sim g_s^2 \,\langle \tau_b \rangle \ll \langle \tau_b \rangle\,.
\label{minimum}
\end{equation}
In order to study the inflationary dynamics, it is convenient to work with the canonically normalised inflaton $\phi$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
\tau_f = e^{k \phi} = \langle \tau_f \rangle \,e^{k \varphi}\qquad\text{with}\qquad k = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\,,
\label{CN}
\end{equation}
where we have shifted the inflaton from its minimum as $\phi = \langle \phi \rangle + \varphi$. The scalar potential (\ref{infpot2}) written in terms of $\varphi$ looks like:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm inf} = \frac{A W_0^2}{\langle \tau_f \rangle^2 {V}^2} \left(C_\dS+ e^{-2 k \varphi}- 4 e^{-\frac{k \varphi}{2}} + {R}_1\, e^{k \varphi} + {R}_2\, e^{\frac{k \varphi}{2}}\right)\,,
\label{Vref}
\end{equation}
where we added a constant $C_\dS=3 - {R}_1-{R}_2$ to obtain a Minkowski (or slightly dS) vacuum and:
\begin{equation}
{R}_1 = \frac{16 C_2}{C_1^2}= \left(\frac{C_f^\KK C_b^\KK}{C_\W}\right)^2 \frac{g_s^4}{18}\ll 1 \,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
and (without loss of generality we choose $\lambda=-|\lambda|<0$):
\begin{equation}
{R}_2 = \frac{8 C_3}{C_1^{5/3}}\left(\frac{2}{{V}}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{18\,W_0^2}{\pi} \frac{\left(C_f^\KK\right)^{4/3}}{C_\W^{5/3}}
\frac{|\lambda|\,g_s^{5/6}}{{V}^{1/3}} \ll 1 \,. \nonumber\\
\label{Rs}
\end{equation}
Note that for ${R}_2 \ll {R}_1\ll 1$ (\ref{Vref}) reproduces exactly the inflationary potential of `fibre inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}. For ${R}_1 = 10^{-6} \,(10^{-5})$ and ${R}_2 = 0$ we obtain the same predictions: $n_s \simeq 0.964 \,(0.971)$ and $r \simeq 0.007 \,(0.008)$.\footnote{These values are actually slightly different than those reported in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} since we are evaluating them at $50$, instead of $60$, e-foldings before the end of inflation.} 

On the other hand, for ${R}_1 \ll {R}_2\ll 1$ the potential (\ref{Vref}) is very similar to the one of `$\alpha'$ inflation' since in both cases the plateau is generated by a winding loop effect and the steepening for large $\varphi$ is due to an $F^4$ term \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. The only difference is the term responsible for the minimum at $\varphi=0$. In our case it is a KK loop correction whereas in \cite{Cicoli:2016chb} it is another higher derivative $\alpha'$ effect. Due to this small difference, the final predictions for the two main cosmological observables are slightly different. In particular, for the same tensor-to-scalar ratio, in our case the spectral index is a bit larger since when the first derivatives of the two inflationary potentials are the same (and so $\epsilon \propto V'^2$ and $r=16\epsilon$ are the same), the second derivative of (\ref{Vref}) is larger than the one of the pure `$\alpha'$ inflation' potential (and so $\eta\propto V''$ and $n_s=1+2\eta-6\epsilon$ are larger). For illustrative purposes, ${R}_2 = 1.5\cdot 10^{-3}$ and ${R}_1 = 0$ would lead to $n_s \simeq 0.976$ and $r \simeq 0.01$ while `$\alpha'$ inflation' predicts $n_s\simeq 0.972$ for the same $r$ \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}.

Let us now consider both positive exponentials in (\ref{Vref}) and compare their relative strength. Note that the term proportional to ${R}_1$ becomes relevant and starts lifting the inflationary plateau roughly when:
\begin{equation}
0.1 \left(C_\dS - 4 \,e^{-\frac{k \varphi}{2}}\right) \simeq {R}_1\, e^{k \varphi}\,.
\label{loopssteepening}
\end{equation}
Two illustrative numerical results are:
\begin{equation}
\varphi_1 \simeq 10.9 \quad \text{for} \quad {R}_1 = 10^{-6} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \varphi_2 \simeq 8.9 \quad \text{for} \quad {R}_1 = 10^{-5} \,.
\label{philoops}
\end{equation}
Following the same logic, the point where the positive exponential proportional to ${R}_2$ starts spoiling the flatness of the plateau can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
0.1 \left(C_\dS - 4 e^{-\frac{k \varphi}{2}}\right) \simeq {R}_2\, e^{k \varphi/2}\,.
\label{F4steepening}
\end{equation}
Fig. \ref{fig1} shows the value of $\varphi$ where the $F^4$ term becomes relevant as a function of ${R}_2$, and compares it with the two numerical results in (\ref{philoops}). It is clear that the steepening, and hence also the cosmological observables, are determined by the $F^4$ term for ${R}_2 > 5 \cdot 10^{-4}$ if ${R}_1 = 10^{-6}$, and for ${R}_2 > 2 \cdot 10^{-3}$ if ${R}_1 = 10^{-6}$. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth, angle=0]{plot1.eps}
\caption{The red curve shows the point where the $F^4$ term starts spoiling the flatness of the inflationary plateau as a function of the small parameter ${R}_2$. The green and blue horizontal lines show the values where the KK loop proportional to ${R}_1$ becomes relevant for ${R}_1=10^{-6}$ and ${R}_1=10^{-5}$ respectively.} \label{fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Fig. \ref{fig2} we plot the inflationary potential for the three cases ${R}_2 = \{0, 7 \cdot 10^{-4}, 1.5 \cdot 10^{-3}\}$ and ${R}_1 = 10^{-6}$. The two limiting cases with ${R}_2 = 0$ and ${R}_2=1.5\cdot 10^{-3}$ reproduce respectively `fibre inflation' and `$\alpha'$ inflation'. The corresponding predictions for the cosmological observables are reported in Tab. \ref{tab1}. Note that both $r$ and $n_s$ become larger when ${R}_2$ increases since horizon exit takes place in a steeper region of the scalar potential.

The right amplitude of the density perturbations can be obtained by imposing the COBE normalisation:
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{V_{\rm inf}^3}{V_{\rm inf}^{'\, 2}}\right|_{\text{horizon exit}} = 2.7 \times 10^{-7}\,,
\label{COBE}
\end{equation}
which, for $g_s = 0.1$ and ${V} = 10^3$, requires natural values of $W_0$ reported in Tab. \ref{tab1}. Moreover ${R}_1 = 10^{-6}$ and ${R}_2$ can be exactly reproduced with reasonable choices of the underlying parameters $C_\W = 90$, $C^\KK_f = 65$, $C^\KK_b = 0.58$ and the values of $|\lambda|$ listed in Tab. \ref{tab1}. 

Let us finally check the consistency of the effective field theory. In order to trust our single field approximation, the mass of the volume mode has to be larger than the Hubble scale $H^2 \simeq V_{\rm inf}/3$. This condition boils down to:
\begin{equation}
\delta = \frac{H^2}{m^2_{{V}}} \simeq \frac{V_{\rm inf}}{V_{\alpha'}} \ll 1\,,
\label{singlefield}
\end{equation}
where the $V_{\alpha'}$ is the leading ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ contribution to the scalar potential and reads:
\begin{equation}
V_{\alpha'} = \kappa \frac{3 \xi W_0^2}{4 g_s^{3/2} {V}^3}\,.
\end{equation}
As shown in Tab. \ref{tab1}, the single field approximation is under control since $\delta\ll 1$ for each case (our CY example has $\chi_{\rm eff} = -190$ which gives $\xi = 0.46$). Moreover the $\alpha'$ expansion can be trusted only if:
\begin{equation}
\zeta = \frac{\xi}{2 g_s^{3/2} {V}} \ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
The previous choice of $g_s$ and ${V}$ gives $\zeta \simeq 0.007$, implying that also the $\alpha'$ expansion is under control. Finally, our choice of microscopic parameters leads to $\langle \tau_f \rangle \simeq 60 \gg \langle \tau_s \rangle \simeq 3$, so that the corrections proportional to $\langle \tau_s \rangle/\tau_f\lesssim 0.05$ in (\ref{VA1}) can be consistently neglected.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

String inflation models are very promising to describe the early universe due to the presence of approximate symmetries which can explain the flatness of the inflationary potential. However they sometimes lack a fully consistent description of the mechanism responsible to stabilise all the moduli in a concrete Calabi-Yau compactification. 

In this paper we presented the first explicit type IIB examples of globally consistent models where the Calabi-Yau background is described by toric geometry, all closed string moduli are stabilised, and the scalar potential of one of the K\"ahler moduli, namely the fibre modulus, is suitable to drive inflation. In particular we managed to produce global embeddings of both `fibre inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} and `$\alpha'$ inflation' \cite{Cicoli:2016chb} models which can predict primordial gravitational waves which might be detectable in the near future. 

After finding $45$ different `weak Swiss cheese' Calabi-Yau manifolds with $h^{1,1}= 3$ with a shrinkable del Pezzo divisor needed for LVS moduli stabilisation, we focused on one of them and provided different consistent models with O7/O3-planes and D3/D7-branes which lead to the generation of the correct perturbative (both in $\alpha'$ and $g_s$) and non-perturbative effects to stabilise all the K\"ahler moduli and reproduce the potential of fibre inflation models. In particular, we showed that the inflationary potential features a long plateau that is naturally generated by winding loop corrections.  At large inflaton values the inflationary potential has instead a raising behaviour which, depending on the values of the underlying parameters, can be due to either KK loop effects of higher derivative contributions. 

We believe that this paper represents an important step forward in the construction of globally consistent string inflation models even if Calabi-Yau manifolds with $h^{1,1}=3$ are too simple to allow also for the realisation of a chiral visible sector. Chiral matter can be included only in the presence of non-vanishing gauge fluxes on D7-branes which, when combined with the requirement of a viable inflationary direction, require Calabi-Yau manifolds with $h^{1,1}=4$. We leave the study of this case for future work.

\subsection{Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{ssec:StandardModel}

The Standard Model of particle physics~\cite{Agashe:2014kda} is a quantum field theory based on the gauge group
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SMGaugeGroup}
G_{\rm SM} = SU(3)_{\rm col} \times SU(2)_{\rm L} \times U(1)_{Y}\,.
\end{align}
The gauge theory based on $SU(3)_{\rm col}$ describes strong interactions and it is called \textit{Quantum Chromo-Dynamics} (QCD), while the $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times U(1)_{\rm Y}$ component describes electroweak (EW) interactions. Matter particles are organized in three families of quarks and leptons, as summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:SMFamilies}, transforming under the gauge groups as reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:SMMatter}.\\

\end{small}

The most interesting feature of the strong sector is asymptotic freedom, which explains the hierarchy in eq. \eqref{eq:ProtonVsPlanckMass}. The coupling constant of strong interactions depends on the energy $Q$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:StrongCouplingRunning}
\alpha^2_s (Q) \equiv \frac{g_s^2 (Q)}{4 \pi} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{11 N_{\rm c} - 2 N_{f}}{12 \pi} \log \left(\frac{Q^2}{\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2}\right)} \,,
\end{align}
where $N_{\rm c} = 3$ is the number of colors, $N_f$ is the number of kinematically accessible quark flavours (e.g. $N_f = 5$ at $Q = M_Z$) and from measurements it turns out that $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \simeq 200 \,$ MeV \cite{Agashe:2014kda}. In the limit $Q^2 \rightarrow \infty$ the strong coupling constant vanishes, giving rise to asymptotic freedom. At low $Q^2$ on the other hand, QCD is in the strong regime and quarks are constrained to form bound states called \textit{hadrons}, such as the proton, the pions, etc..\\

The dynamics of the electroweak sector is much more involved than that of the strong one. SM is a chiral theory, i.e. left and right components of the fermionic fields transform differently under the gauge groups, as it can be observed in Tab.~\ref{tab:SMMatter}. The chiral nature of the SM interactions is reflected in the fact that mass terms are forbidden for all the fermions of the theory as a consequence of gauge invariance. The higgs field is a complex field transforming as a doublet under $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ and its dynamics is determined by the scalar potential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HiggsPotential}
V_{\rm Higgs} = \lambda \left(|H|^2 - \frac{v^2}{2}\right)^2 \,,
\end{align}
whose minimum is given by $\langle \left|H\right|^2\rangle = \frac{v^2}{2}$. The higgs VEV triggers a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the group of electroweak interactions down to the group of symmetry of the electromagnetism
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SMSymmetryBreaking}
SU(2)_{\rm L} \times U(1)_{\rm Y} \rightarrow U(1)_{\rm EM}\,.
\end{align}
The \textit{ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking} mechanism (EWSB) is also called \textit{higgs mechanism}. Using gauge invariance it is possible to show that without loss of generality the higgs field can be written (in the unitary gauge) as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HiggsFieldUnitaryGauge}
H(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{h^0(x)}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{align}
where $h^0(x)$ is the unique, electrically neutral, physical scalar excitation about the higgs vacuum. As a consequence of the higgs mechanism, three higgs degrees of freedom are swallowed by the gauge bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$, which become massive. Moreover, through the Yukawa couplings
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SMYukawacouplings}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm Yuk} = Y^{ij}_U \overline{Q}^i u^j_R H^* + Y^{ij}_D \overline{Q}^i d^j_R H + Y^{ij}_{\rm L} \overline{L}^i e^j_R H + \text{h.c.} \,,
\end{align}
the higgs mechanism gives mass to all the fermions of the theory, except the neutrinos. The fermion masses are given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FermionMasses}
m_f = \frac{y_f}{\sqrt{2}} v\,,
\end{align}
where $v = 170 \,$ GeV, while $y_f$ is an eigenvalue of the proper Yukawa matrix among those appearing in eq. \eqref{eq:SMYukawacouplings}.\\

The Yukawa couplings in eq. \eqref{eq:SMYukawacouplings} are the most general compatibly with gauge invariance and renormalizability, and they feature an accidental invariance under the global symmetries \textit{baryon number} $B$ and \textit{lepton number} $L$. A clear manifestation of the conservation of the baryon number is the proton lifetime, which is constrained by the Kamiokande experiment to be $\tau_{\rm proton} > 10^{32}-10^{33} \,$ years \cite{Hirata:1989kn}, while lepton number conservation\footnote{Lepton number is actually violated by neutrino oscillations.} puts a strict bound on processes such as $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, whose branching ratio is currently $Br(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma) < 5.7 \times 10^{-13}$ \cite{Adam:2013mnn}. The hypercharge assignments of Tab.~\ref{tab:SMMatter} are dictated by anomaly cancellation.\\

A crucial point in the phenomenology of the SM is that the fields enumerated in Tab.~\ref{tab:SMMatter} form a basis of gauge eigenstates, which does not diagonalize the mass matrices obtained through the Yukawa couplings in eq. \eqref{eq:SMYukawacouplings}. In order to get the mass eigenstates it is necessary to diagonalize them by unitary transformations $V_{\rm L}^{U, D, L}$, $V_{\rm R}^{U, D, L}$ acting on the left and right handed fermions respectively. Eventually the $W^\pm$ bosons couple to the quarks through the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which is not diagonal
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CKM}
\left|V_{\rm CKM}\right| = \left|V^U_{\rm L} \left(V_{\rm L}^D\right)^\dagger \right| = \begin{pmatrix} 0.9742 & 0.226 & 0.0036 \\ 0.226 & 0.9733 & 0.042 \\ 0.0087 & 0.041 & 0.99913 \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{align}
and produces a mixing of the quark flavors. On the other hand the CKM matrix does not appear in the couplings of the $Z$ boson with quarks, which implies the absence of \textit{flavour-changing neutral currents}. A similar mixing does not happen in the lepton sector of the SM, as a consequence of the fact that neutrinos are massless. The CKM matrix has complex entries, but many of them can be eliminated by re-parametrization of the fields. Eventually a single phase turns out to be physical, producing CP-violation in the SM. A second source of CP-violation is the $\theta$-term
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ThetaTerm}
\mathcal{L_{\theta}} = \frac{\theta}{32 \pi^2} G_{\mu \nu} \tilde{G}^{\mu \nu} \,,
\end{align}
which can be added to the SM lagrangian, where $G_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength of QCD. Although this term is a total derivative, it can contribute to physical processes through gauge instantons. Since it would give a contribution to the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which is highly constrained, the value of $\theta$ has to be minuscule: $\theta < 10^{-10}$. This unexplained high degree of fine-tuning required to match the experimental data is known as \textit{Strong CP Problem}.

\subsection{Standard Model of Cosmology}
\label{ssec:StandardModelCosmology}

As already discussed in the introduction to the chapter, the Standard Model of cosmology is based on the Standard Model of particle physics supplemented by General Relativity, which describes gravity at the classical level in terms of the dynamics of the space-time metric $g_{\mu \nu}$. The equation of motion for the metric tensor can be inferred from the \textit{Einstein-Hilbert} action, which reads\footnote{We neglect the cosmological constant here.}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EinsteinHilbertAction}
S_{\rm EH} = \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{2} \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \, \mathcal{R} \,,
\end{align}
where $g = \text{det} \left(g_{\mu \nu}\right)$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is the \textit{Ricci scalar} associated to the space-time metric $g_{\mu \nu}$. $M_{\rm P}$ denotes the reduced Planck mass, which in terms of the universal gravitational constant $G$ can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PlanckMass}
M_{\rm P} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8 \pi G}} \simeq 2.4 \times 10^{18} \, \rm GeV \,.
\end{align}
From the action in eq. \eqref{eq:EinsteinHilbertAction} it is possible to infer the famous Einstein's equation
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EinsteinEquation}
\mathcal{R}_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{R} g_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu} \,,
\end{align}
where $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor and $\mathcal{R}_{\mu \nu}$ is the \textit{Ricci tensor}.\\

The Standard Model of cosmology~\cite{Gorbunov:2011zz}, also called \textit{Hot Big Bang Theory}, assumes that the universe started in a hot and dense state. As the universe expanded, the thermal bath cooled and progressively became less dense. One of the most exciting discoveries in cosmology dates back to 1998, when two independent projects~\cite{Riess:1998cb, Perlmutter:1998np} observed that the universe is currently expanding at an accelerate rate. The basic observation about the universe is that it is isotropic and homogeneous at large spatial scales, above the size of the largest observed structures i.e. supercluster of galaxies, which can reach a diameter of tens of Megaparsec~\cite{Galaxies}. As the observations suggest that space is essentially flat~\cite{Ade:2013zuv}, isotropy and homogeneity allow us to write the metric of the expanding universe as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FRWMetric}
ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t) d \mathbf{x}^2 \,,
\end{align}
which is called \textit{Friedmann-Robertson-Walker} (FRW) metric\footnote{The FRW in eq. \eqref{eq:FRWMetric} is written in the case of flat universe.}. The entire dynamics of the universe is described by the evolution of the time-dependent \textit{scale factor} $a(t)$. Since the universe expands, $a(t)$ is an increasing monotonic function of the time. The rate of expansion is written in terms of the \textit{Hubble parameter}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HubbleParameter}
H(t) = \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)} \,,
\end{align}
whose current value $H_0$\footnote{The subscript $0$ is used to denote current values of physical quantities in cosmology.} defines the Hubble law
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HubbleLaw}
v = H_0 r \,,
\end{align}
where $v$ is the speed of a far galaxy and $r$ is its distance from the Earth. The reciprocal of the current values of the Hubble constant gives an estimate of the age of the universe, which is approximately $t_0 = H_0^{-1} \simeq 14 \times 10^9$ yrs.\\

Depending on the source of energy which dominates the universe in a given epoch, the scale factor has a different time-dependence, as reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:ScaleFactor}.
\begin{small}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
Source of Energy & $a(t)$ & Hubble parameter  \\
\hline
Radiation & $\sim t^{1/2}$ & $\frac{1}{2 t}$ \\
Matter & $\sim t^{2/3}$ & $\frac{2}{3 t}$ \\
Vacuum Energy & $\sim e^{H t}$ & const.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Scale factor as a function of time, depending on the source of energy dominating the universe in a given epoch.}
\label{tab:ScaleFactor}
\end{table}
\end{small}
The dynamics of the scale factor is dictated by the Einstein's equation. Assuming that the equation of state of the universe takes the perfect fluid form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EqStatePerfectFluid}
p = w \rho \,,
\end{align}
and using the FRW metric in eq. \eqref{eq:FRWMetric} it is possible to rewrite the Einstein's equation as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FriedmannEquation}
H^2 =& \, \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \left(\rho_{\rm matter} + \rho_{\rm radiation} + \rho_{\Lambda} + \rho_{\rm curv}\right) \,, \nonumber \\  
&\dot{H} + H^2 = \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{1}{6} \left(\rho + 3 p\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\rho_i$ denote the contributions to the total energy density of the universe $\rho$ coming from different sources, and the derivatives are taken with respect to $t$. Equations in \eqref{eq:FriedmannEquation} are called \textit{Friedmann's Equations}. In the first Friedmann's equation we also included a contribution $\rho_{\rm curv}$ due to the curvature of the universe, to be as generic as possible, even if observations show that it is negligibly small~\cite{Ade:2013zuv}. In terms of the critical value of the energy density $\rho_{\rm c} = \frac{3}{8 \pi G} H_0^2 = 5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{GeV}/\text{cm}^3$, it is possible to define the current fractions of energy density
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OmegaParameters}
\Omega_i = \frac{\rho_{i,0}}{\rho_{\rm c}} \,,
\end{align}
in terms of which the first Friedmann's equation takes the nice form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SmartFriedmannEquation}
H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho_{\rm c} \left[\Omega_{\rm matter} \left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^3 + \Omega_{\rm radiation} \left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^4 + \Omega_{\Lambda} + \Omega_{\rm curv} \left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2\right] \,.
\end{align}
A few observations about eq. \eqref{eq:SmartFriedmannEquation} are in order. First, at the current epoch the various components sum up exactly to one. The second observation is that from the scaling of the different sources of energy density, it is possible to understand the sequence of the dominating ones. At the very early stages of the universe, when $a \ll a_0$, radiation dominated. Subsequently matter started to dominate at the age $t_{\rm matter} = 10^5 \,$ yrs. The vacuum energy, also called \textit{Cosmological Constant} $\Lambda$, has started his period of domination very late, at the age of $t_{\Lambda} \simeq 7 \times 10^9$ yrs. The parameters $\Omega_i$ represent the current fractions of the energy density, which are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CurrentFractions}
\Omega_{\rm radiation} \approx 5 \times 10^{-5} \,, \quad \Omega_{\rm matter} \simeq 0.27 \,, \quad \Omega_{\Lambda} \simeq 0.73 \,, \quad \left|\Omega_{\rm curv}\right| < 0.005 \,,
\end{align}
so that the universe is currently dominated by the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$, with a minor contribution from matter, divided into \textit{baryonic matter} and \textit{Dark Matter} (DM) in the following proportions
\begin{align}
\label{eq:BaryonAndDM}
\Omega_{\rm baryons} \simeq 0.046 \,, \qquad \Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 0.23 \,.
\end{align}

DM is presumably composed by stable massive particles not included in the SM, which do not interact electromagnetically and strongly. These compose clumps of energy density which account for most of the mass of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. There are several experimental evidences for DM existence, which also provide estimates for its abundance, namely
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accurate reconstructions of the mass distributions in clusters of galaxies is obtained through the observations of gravitational lensing of the light coming from further galaxies~\cite{Lesgourgues:2007te, Massey:2007gh}.
\item X-ray observations of clusters just after their collisions show that most of baryons are in a hot, ionized intergalactic gas. The total mass of clusters exceeds the mass of baryons in luminous matter by an order of magnitude~\cite{Vikhlinin:2005mp}.
\item The study of the motion of stars at the periphery of galaxies gives further motivations for DM. Assuming circular motion, the dependence of the velocity $v(R)$ on the distance $R$ from galactic center follows the Newton's law
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NewtonLaw}
v(R) = \sqrt{\frac{G M(R)}{R}}\,.
\end{align}
Observationally, $v(R) = \text{const.}$ sufficiently far away from the center, and this deviation from the expectations can be explained by assuming that luminous matter is embedded into dark clouds of larger size~\cite{Begeman:1991iy}.
\item Another possibility is to measure the speed of galaxies in galactic clusters and use the virial theorem to infer the gravitational potential and hence the total mass in the cluster itself. It turns out that the estimated total mass by far exceeds the sum of masses of individual galaxies in clusters. This discrepancy can be explained if most of the mass is due to DM which is distributed smoothly over the cluster.
\end{enumerate}

The presence of DM in the universe is quite important for our own existence, since without it the universe today would still be pretty homogeneous, and as a consequence large scale structures (like galaxies and clusters of galaxies) would have never formed. DM can be of three different types, depending on the mass $m_{\rm DM}$ of the particles which compose it: if $m_{\rm DM} > 30 \, \text{KeV}$ it is called \textit{Cold Dark Matter} (CDM), while if $m_{\rm DM} = 1-10 \, \text{KeV}$ then it is called \textit{Warm Dark Matter} (WDM), if $m_{\rm DM} < 1 \,$ KeV it is called \textit{Hot Dark Matter} (HDM). In the present thesis we will deal with CDM. In this case, one of the best candidates for DM is represented by \textit{Weakly Interacting Massive Particles} (WIMP's). In fact the abundance of DM is roughly given by\footnote{The entropy density $s$ is often used to measure the number of particles $N_i$ of a given particle species in a comoving volume, since in case of entropy conservation $s \sim a^{-3}$, and then $N_i = n_i/s$, where $n_i$ is the number density of particles.}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DMAbundance}
\frac{\rho_{\rm DM}}{s_0} \approx \langle \sigma v \rangle^{-1} \,,
\end{align}
where $\rho_{\rm DM}$ is the energy density of DM, $s_0$ is the current value of the density of entropy and $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is the annihilation cross section for DM particles. If the annihilation cross section is of the same order of magnitude as that of weakly interacting particles $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-8} \,$ GeV$^{-2}$, the abundance of DM roughly matches the observed value. This observation is usually called the \textit{WIMP miracle}.\\

The estimate in eq. \eqref{eq:DMAbundance} contains a concept which is fundamental in the understanding of the thermal history of the universe: as the expansion of the universe $H$ equals the rate of interaction of a given particle $\Gamma$ then the particle \textit{freezes-out}, decoupling from the thermal bath. This concept is useful to determine the abundance of CDM, as well as for instance the epoch of neutrino decoupling.\\

The standard cosmological model which includes CDM and dark energy with abundances close to those reported in eq. \eqref{eq:CurrentFractions} and eq. \eqref{eq:BaryonAndDM} is called $\Lambda$CDM. We summarize the key events in the thermal history of the the universe, according to the $\Lambda$CDM, (see also Tab.~\ref{tab:ThermalHistory})
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Baryogenesis -} The universe features an asymmetry between observed matter and antimatter\footnote{We ignore the possible existence of compact objects made of antimatter, such that there is no asymmetry as in eq. \eqref{eq:MatterAntiMatterAsymmetry}. Such compact objects are predicted in some models~\cite{Khlopov:2000as, Dolgov:2008wu} and do not contradict observations~\cite{Khlopov:2002ww, Dolgov:2010cb}.}, which can be quantified through the ratio
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MatterAntiMatterAsymmetry}
\eta = \frac{n_b}{s_0} \simeq 8 \times 10^{-10}\,,
\end{align}
where $n_b$ is the number density of baryonic particles. Since we do not have experimental access to the energies at which baryogenesis presumably took place, we do not know which physical process has produced the asymmetry in eq. \eqref{eq:MatterAntiMatterAsymmetry}, despite many mechanisms have been proposed.
\item \textbf{Electroweak Phase Transition - } Assuming that the universe was reheated at a temperature above $M_{\rm EW}$, when the thermal bath reached a temperature of about $100 \,$ GeV, the electroweak phase transition occurred~\cite{Kirzhnits:1972iw, Kirzhnits:1972ut, Dolan:1973qd, Weinberg:1974hy}, causing the higgs field to get a VEV. As a consequence the electroweak group $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times U(1)_{\rm Y}$ got broken to the electromagnetism one $U(1)_{\rm em}$ and the particles of the SM became massive.
\item \textbf{QCD Phase Transition - } Above $150 \,$ MeV quarks were \textit{asymptotically free}, and the thermal bath was composed by a phase of matter called \textit{Quark Gluon Plasma}. Around the temperature of $150 \,$ MeV strong interactions became relevant and the quarks were suddenly constrained to form hadrons.
\item \textbf{DM Freeze-Out - } Assuming that DM is of the cold type and that it is composed of WIMPs, it decoupled at a temperature around $1 \,$ MeV.
\item \textbf{Neutrino decoupling - } Since neutrinos interacted with the thermal bath only through weak interactions, the same estimate as for WIMP DM holds, with a minor correction, so that the freeze-out took place at a temperature around $0.8 \,$ MeV.
\item \textbf{Electron-Positron annihilation - } Electrons and positrons annihilated soon after neutrino decoupling at a temperature of $0.5 \,$ MeV, slightly reheating the photon thermal bath. As a consequence the energy density of neutrinos $\rho_\nu$ is related to that of photons $\rho_\gamma$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NeutrinoPhotonTemperature}
\rho_\nu = \frac{7}{8} N_{\rm eff} \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{4/3} \rho_\gamma \,,
\end{align}
where $N_{\rm eff}$ is the \textit{effective number of neutrinos}, and this expression is valid after neutrino decoupling. The effective number of neutrinos after $e^+ e^-$ annihilation in the SM is $N_{\rm eff, SM} = 3.046$.

\item \textbf{Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) - } At a temperature of about $300 \,$ KeV, light elements started to be formed. This is the furthest epoch of which we have proper and detailed comprehension~\cite{Alpher:1948ve, Dempster:1948zz}, both from a phenomenological and from a theoretical point of view.
\item \textbf{Recombination - } At a temperature of about $0.3 \,$ KeV the neutral hydrogen formed via the reaction $e^- + p^+ \rightarrow H + \gamma$, since its reverse reaction had become disfavored.
\item \textbf{Photon Decoupling - } Before recombination the photons were coupled to the rest of the plasma essentially through Thomson scattering $e^- + \gamma \rightarrow e^- + \gamma$. The sharp drop in the free electron density after recombination made Thomson scattering inefficient and the photons decoupled at $0.25 \,$ eV. As a consequence, they started their free-stream through the universe, and are today observed as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
\end{itemize}

The CMB consists of free-streaming photons which last-scattered about $400000 \,$ years after the ``birth'' of the universe. They have an excellent black-body spectrum with temperature~\cite{Gawiser:2000az}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CMBTemperature}
T_0 = 2.725 \pm 0.001 \, \text{K} \,.
\end{align}
This spectrum is almost perfectly uniform in all directions, so that we can infer that the universe at photon decoupling was almost perfectly isotropic and homogeneous. Small perturbations to this uniformity have been measured to be of order $\frac{\delta T}{T_0} \sim 10^{-5}$~\cite{deBernardis:2000sbo, Hanany:2000qf, Spergel:2006hy, Ade:2015xua}.

\section{Beyond the Standard Paradigm}
\label{sec:BSM}

\subsection{Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{ssec:BSM}

We start by listing all the problems featured by the Standard Model of particle physics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Observational issues}.
The Standard Model does not describe
\begin{itemize}
\item gravity,
\item dark energy,
\item dark matter,
\item neutrino masses.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theoretical issues}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Electroweak Hierarchy Problem -} This problem is two-fold: the first issue is to understand the physical origin of the hierarchy between the scales $M_{\rm EW}$ and $M_{\rm P}$, while the second issue is to understand how it is possible to keep this hierarchy stable against quantum corrections. In fact, as we mentioned in the introduction to the chapter, in general scalar fields are not protected by any symmetry, and then they can receive arbitrarily large quantum corrections to their mass. This is the case for the higgs field, which receives quadratic corrections of the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HiggsCorrections}
\delta m^2_{\rm Higgs} \simeq \frac{y_{\rm t}}{8 \pi^2} \Lambda_{\rm cutoff}^2 \,,
\end{align}
where $\Lambda_{\rm cutoff}$ is the energy scale at which physics beyond the SM appears, ranging from $M_{\rm EW}$ to $M_{\rm P}$, while $y_{\rm t} \sim 1$ is the Yukawa coupling of the largest correction due to the top quark. If $\Lambda_{\rm cutoff} \simeq M_{\rm P}$ the fine-tuning required in order to keep the higgs mass light is of the same order of the ratio $M_{\rm EW}/M_{\rm P} \sim 10^{-16}$.
\item \textit{Strong CP Problem -} As we mentioned in Sec.~\ref{ssec:StandardModel}, a term as in eq. \eqref{eq:ThetaTerm} can be added to the SM lagrangian, and the angle $\theta$ is severely constrained by the experimental bounds on the electric dipole moment of the neutron: $\theta < 10^{-10}$. The lack of a dynamical mechanism to this huge fine-tuning of $\theta$ is known as Strong CP Problem.
\item \textit{Gauge Coupling Unification - } The running of the Renormalization Group (RG) makes gauge coupling constants evolve in such a way that they tend to meet at a high scale. However, in the Standard Model the gauge coupling unification is not sufficiently precise to imply that it is not simply an accident.
\item \textit{Arbitrariness -} There are many arbitrary parameters in the lagrangian of the SM, whose values have to be inserted by hand, in order for the predictions to match with experimental data. These parameters include the number of families of the SM, the masses of fermions (excluding neutrinos) which span a range of five order of magnitude (from $m_e \simeq 0.5 \,$ MeV to $m_t \simeq 170 \,$ GeV.) and are intimately related to Yukawa couplings, CKM angles, neutrino masses and mixing angles. All these parameters deserve a deeper explanation in terms of dynamical mechanisms which fix their values to the physical ones. Analogously, also the higgs scalar potential is assumed to have the form given in eq. \eqref{eq:HiggsPotential} for no good reason, in order to produce the electroweak symmetry breaking.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Supersymmetry}
\label{sssec:SUSY}

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a space-time symmetry which mixes bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom of a theory. In its ten-dimensional version, supersymmetry is an essential ingredient of string theory, as we observe in Sec. \ref{sec:StringTheory}. Moreover, two-dimensional worldsheet supersymmetry is crucial in order for string theory to admit space-time fermions.\\

Four-dimensional global supersymmetry has been the main candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model for decades, mainly due to its ability to address the hierarchy problem~\cite{Nilles:1995ci, Martin:1997ns}. The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model of particle physics is the \textit{Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model} (MSSM), whose chiral spectrum is summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:MSSMSpectrum}. Essentially it provides a doubling of the degrees of freedom of the SM: to each SM particle corresponds a superpartner with different spin and equal mass. An exception is represented by the higgs sector, where anomalies cancellation requires an additional higgs doublet along with the superpartners. All the fields in Tab.~\ref{tab:MSSMSpectrum} can be accommodated in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ chiral supermultiplets. In addition to the fields in Tab.~\ref{tab:MSSMSpectrum} there are also vector multiplets composed of the gauge bosons $B, W^0, W^\pm, g^i$ and the respective \textit{gauginos} $\widetilde{B}, \widetilde{W}^0, \widetilde{W}^\pm, \widetilde{g}^i$, where $i = 1, \dots, 8$ since \textit{gluons} $g^i$ and \textit{gluinos} $\widetilde{g}^i$ transform in the adjoint representation $\mathbf{8}$ of $SU(3)_{\rm col}$. The fermionic fields $\widetilde{B}$ and $\widetilde{W}$ are called \textit{bino} and \textit{wino} respectively.\\

\vspace{-0.6cm}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The Yukawa couplings between matter fermions and the higgs field are given by the minimal phenomenologically viable superpotential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MSSMSuperpotential}
W_{\rm MSSM} = \overline{u}^i Y^{ij}_U Q^j H_u - \overline{d}^i Y^{ij}_D Q^j H_d + \overline{e}^i Y^{ij}_{\rm L} L^j H_d + \mu H_u H_d \,,
\end{align}
so that the masses of leptons and quarks are determined as usual by the higgs mechanism. Eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMSuperpotential} contains also an explicit mass term for the higgs, which is called $\mu$-term and determines the mass of higgsinos. The $\mu$-term is required in order to get a phenomenologically satisfactory EW symmetry breaking. The superpotential in eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMSuperpotential} is not the most generic renormalizable and gauge invariant one: terms violating $B$ and $L$ have been excluded in order to avoid rapid proton decay. All the excluded terms violate an additional symmetry of the MSSM, called $R$-parity, under which SM particles are even and their superpartners are odd. $R$-parity can be interpreted as a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of the symmetry $U(1)_{B-L}$, which is spontaneously broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ by the VEV of a scalar with charge $2$ under $B-L$. $R$-parity has important consequences from a phenomenological point of view, since it implies that the \textit{Lightest Supersymmetric Particle} (LSP) is stable and consequently it could be a viable candidate for DM.\\


Supersymmetry must be spontaneously broken in nature, since a selectron with mass $m_{\tilde{e}} \simeq 0.5 \,$ MeV has not been observed. Regardless of the explicit mechanism of SUSY-breaking, its effects can be parametrized in terms of the \textit{soft-terms}, i.e. additional mass terms and cubic interactions~\cite{Chung:2003fi}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MSSMSoftTerms}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm soft} =&\, \frac{1}{2} \left(\sum_a M_a \lambda_a \lambda_a + \text{c.c.}\right) - m_{ij}^2 C^i \overline{C}^j - \nonumber \\
& - \left(A_{ijk} Y_{ijk} C^i C^j C^k + B H_d H_u + \text{c.c.}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $M_a$ are the masses of the gauginos of the MSSM, $m_{ij}$ are the masses of the scalar fields $C^i$ of the MSSM, $A_{ijk}$ are called $A$-terms and $B$ is called $B$-term. Moreover we defined $Y_{Kij} \equiv Y_K^{ij}$, where $K = U, D, L$. The lagrangian in eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMSoftTerms} explicitly breaks supersymmetry, since it introduces mass terms only for the superpartners of the SM particles. The minimal model of SUSY-breaking with universal soft-terms: $M_1 = M_2 = M_3 = M$, $m_{ij} \propto \delta_{ij}$, $A_{ijk} = A_i \delta_{jk}$, is called \textit{Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model} (CMSSM) or also \textit{Minimal Supergravity Model} (mSUGRA).\\

There are many theoretical motivations to look at supersymmetry as a good candidate for the physics beyond the SM.
\begin{itemize}
\item It potentially solves the hierarchy problem, since the divergent diagrams are exactly canceled by the analogous diagrams involving the superpartners, in the case of unbroken supersymmetry. When supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by soft-terms, the quadratic divergences are still eliminated, but there are non-vanishing logarithmic divergences. The hierarchy problem is addressed provided that the mass of squarks is not far beyond $1 \,$ TeV.
\item If $R$-parity is present, the LSP constitutes a good candidate for DM.
\item Provided that the masses of gauginos and higgsinos lie around the TeV scale, the MSSM provides a unification of the coupling constants at the GUT scale $M_{\rm GUT} = 2 \times 10^{16} \,$ GeV. Scalars do not contribute to gauge coupling unification since they enter the equations of the renormalization group for gauge couplings only at two-loops order.
\end{itemize}

It is worth recalling that the higgs potential in the MSSM takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MSSMHiggsPotential}
V_{\rm Higgs} =&\, \frac{1}{8} \left(g_1^2 + g_2^2\right) \left(\left|H_d^0\right|^2-\left|H_u^0\right|^2\right)^2 + \left(B H_d^0 H_u^0 + \text{h.c.}\right) + \nonumber \\
&+ \left(m_{H_d}^2 + |\mu|^2\right) \left|H_d^0\right|^2 + \left(m_{H_u}^2 + |\mu|^2\right) \left|H_u^0\right|^2  \,.
\end{align}
EWSB requires that a linear combination of $H_u^0$ and $H_d^0$ has negative squared mass in the origin $H_u^0 = H_d^0 = 0$. Requiring also that the scalar potential is bounded from below translates into the EWSB conditions\footnote{From the first condition in eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMEWSB} it is possible to infer the so-called \textit{$\mu$-problem}: $\mu$ is a supersymmetric quantity but in order to get a satisfactory SUSY-breaking it has to be of the same order of $m_{H_u}$, $m_{H_d}$, which are non-supersymmetric quantities.}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MSSMEWSB}
\mu^2 = \frac{m_{H_d}^2 - m_{H_u}^2 \tan^2 \beta}{\tan^2 \beta - 1} - \frac{m_Z^2}{2} \,, \nonumber \\
\sin\left(2 \beta\right) = \frac{2 \left|B \mu\right|}{m_{H_d}^2 - m_{H_u}^2 + 2 \mu^2} \,,
\end{align}
where $\tan \beta$ is determined by the ratio between the VEVs of the two higgs doublets
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TanBeta}
\tan \beta = \frac{\langle H_u^0 \rangle}{\langle H_d^0 \rangle}\,.
\end{align}
The conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMEWSB} are not trivially satisfied by the scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:MSSMHiggsPotential}. However EWSB can be triggered by radiative corrections to $m_{H_u}^2$, which receives negative contributions from one-loop diagrams involving the top squark. Consequently also the higgs mechanism finds a dynamical explanation in the MSSM.\\

The EWSB can produce a mixing among the gauge eigenstates of the MSSM, whose superpartner mass spectrum is given by the
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Gluinos -} $\tilde{g}^i$ transform in the adjoint representation $\mathbf{8}$ of $SU(3)_{\rm col}$, so they do not mix with any other particle of the MSSM.
\item \textit{Neutralinos -} Neutral higgsinos $\left(\widetilde{H}_u^0, \widetilde{H}_d^0\right)$ and neutral gauginos $\left(\widetilde{B}, \widetilde{Z}^0\right)$ combine to form neutral mass eigenstates called \textit{neutralinos} $\widetilde{N}_i$, where $i = 1, \dots, 4$. If the lightest neutralino is also the LSP, it can play the role of DM in supersymmetric theories which preserve $R$-parity.
\item \textit{Charginos -} Charged higgsinos $\left(\widetilde{H}_u^+, \widetilde{H}_d^-\right)$ and charged gauginos $\left(\widetilde{W}^+, \widetilde{W}^-\right)$ combine to form two mass eigenstates with charge $\pm 1$, called \textit{charginos} $\widetilde{C}^\pm_i$, where $i = 1, 2$.
\item \textit{Squarks and sleptons - } In principle all the scalars with the same electric charge, $R$-parity and color quantum numbers can mix with each other. Fortunately only squarks of the third generation actually mix, due to the large Yukawa coupling $y_t \sim 1$. It turns out that the mass eigenstates effectively coincide with gauge eigenstates for all scalars except the stop, whose left and right components $(\widetilde{t}_{\rm L}, \widetilde{t}_{\rm R})$ mix and give rise to the physical stops $(\widetilde{t}_1, \widetilde{t}_2)$.
\item \textit{Higgs fields -} Once EWSB has taken place, three out of the four higgs degrees of freedom become the longitudinal polarizations of the electroweak bosons $Z, W^\pm$. The remaining five degrees of freedom are: two CP-even neutral scalars $h^0, H^0$, one CP-odd neutral scalar $A^0$, two charged scalars $H^\pm$. $h^0$ turns out to be the lightest one, and then it plays the role of the SM higgs field. The tree-level masses are given by
\begin{align}
m^2_{A^0} &= 2 |\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + m_{H_d}^2 \,, \\
m_{h^0, H^0}^2 &= \frac{1}{2} \left(m_{A^0}^2 + m_Z^2 \mp \sqrt{\left(m_{A^0}^2 - m_Z^2\right)^2 + 4 m_Z^2 m_{A^0}^2 \sin^2 (2 \beta)}\right) \,,\\ 
m_{H^\pm}^2 &= m_{A^0}^2 + m_W^2 \,,
\end{align}
According to these expressions $m_{h^0} < m_{Z^0}$, but loop-corrections to the lightest higgs mass can raise its value up to $125 \,$ GeV.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Supergravity}
\label{sssec:SUGRA}

Supersymmetry, as described in the previous section, is a global symmetry. Interestingly, as soon as we promote the parameters of a supersymmetry transformation to a space-time-dependent function, general coordinate transformations are included in the theory, which becomes a theory of gravity~\cite{Nilles:1983ge, Cerdeno:1998hs, Wess:1992cp}, and it is called ($\mathcal{N} = 1$) \textit{supergravity}. From a field theoretical point of view, the inclusion of gravity can be described by an additional multiplet, which is called \textit{gravity multiplet}. It contains the mediator of the gravitational interactions: a spin-two massless particle called graviton $g_{\mu \nu}$ and its superpartner, a spin-$3/2$ massless particle called \textit{gravitino} $\psi^\mu_\alpha$ (where $\alpha = 1, 2$ is a spinorial index). The gravitino plays the role of the gauge field of local supersymmetry.\\

A supergravity theory can be completely determined starting from the following three functions of the chiral superfields $\Phi^i$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \Kahler potential $K(\Phi^i, \overline{\Phi}^i)$: it is a real function which determines the kinetic terms of the chiral fields.
\item The holomorphic superpotential $W(\Phi^i)$: along with the \Kahler potential it determines the scalar potential of the supergravity theory.
\item The gauge kinetic functions $f_a(\Phi^i)$: they are holomorphic functions of the chiral superfields $\Phi^i$, which determine the kinetic terms of the gauge bosons and their couplings to axions.
\end{enumerate}

As for global supersymmetry, also the local one has to be spontaneously broken. Local supersymmetry breaking produces the analogous of the higgs mechanism: a scalar field in the hidden sector acquires a VEV which breaks the local supersymmetry. The fermionic superpartner (goldstino) of this scalar field is swallowed by the massless gravitino, which acquires mass. This local SUSY-breaking is called \textit{Super-Higgs mechanism}. From a phenomenological point of view it is interesting to notice that local SUSY-breaking automatically generates soft-terms in the global supersymmetric lagrangian, realizing the so-called \textit{gravity mediated SUSY-breaking}. Usually, the scale of SUSY-breaking is roughly given by the gravitino mass.\\

Unfortunately, even if local supersymmetry automatically includes gravity, it is neither a finite theory nor a renormalizable one, meaning that it does not provide an UV completion of General Relativity.

\subsubsection{GUT Theories}
\label{sssec:GUTs}

As we have seen in Sec.~\ref{sssec:SUSY}, in supersymmetric models gauge coupling unification is achieved at the scale $M_{\rm GUT}$. Another kind of models which provide gauge coupling unification are \textit{Grand Unified Theories} (GUT theories)\footnote{From which the subscript in the unification scale $M_{\rm GUT}$.}~\cite{Ross:1985ai}. They assume that the SM gauge group is actually contained in a larger simple group $G_{\rm GUT}$ which is spontaneously broken to $G_{\rm SM}$ around the GUT scale by a higgs-like mechanism. In this picture, at energies above $M_{\rm GUT}$ gauge couplings are unified into a single value: the gauge coupling associated to the GUT group. In the last decades different alternatives have been studied in the context of GUT theories, the most relevant ones being those with gauge groups $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$ or $E(6)$.\\

For example in the $SU(5)$ GUT, each SM fermionic generation fits into a reducible $SU(5)$ representation $\mathbf{5} + \overline{\mathbf{10}}$. It provides the existence of $24$ bosons, of which $12$ are the SM ones, while the remaining $12$ transform as $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ doublets and $SU(3)_{\rm col}$ triplets. The higgs sector is composed by a $24$ scalar fields transforming in the representation $\mathbf{24}$ of $SU(5)$. The VEVs acquired by some of these fields trigger the symmetry breaking which leads to the SM gauge group. An interesting point about GUT theories is that, since quarks and leptons fit into the same GUT multiplets, they can transform into each other by emission/absorption of a heavy gauge boson, giving rise to lepton/baryon number violation. These interactions are clearly suppressed by the mass of the heavy bosons, leading to a proton lifetime of about $\tau_{\text{proton}, SU(5)} \simeq 4 \times 10^{29} \,$ yrs, which is quite below the super-Kamiokande lower bound $\tau_{\rm proton} \simeq 10^{32} - 10^{33}$, so that the simplest $SU(5)$ GUT is ruled out.\\

GUT theories with different gauge groups have similar features, with increasingly more involved higgs sectors and symmetry breaking patterns. For example the breaking of $SO(10)$ to $G_{\rm SM}$ requires a ``GUT-Higgs'' transforming in the adjoint representation $\mathbf{45}$ of $SO(10)$, plus additional scalar fields transforming in the representation $\mathbf{16}$. Analogously, the lowest-dimensional non-trivial representation of $E(6)$ is the $\mathbf{27}$, which contains the representation $\mathbf{16}$ of $SO(10)$, since it decomposes as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:27GroupDecomposition}
\mathbf{27} = \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{10} + \mathbf{1} \,.
\end{align}
Symmetry breaking in $E(6)$ models is triggered by the VEVs of the ``GUT-Higgs'' field in the adjoint representation of $E(6)$ and of the scalar fields in the $\mathbf{27}$. A possible symmetry breaking pattern is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:E6Symmetrybreaking}
E(6) \quad \longrightarrow \quad SU(3)_{\rm col} \times SU(3)_{\rm L} \times SU(3)_{\rm R} \quad \longrightarrow \quad G_{\rm SM}\,,
\end{align}
where the intermediate gauge group, in which the QCD symmetry is treated on equal footing with left-right symmetries, is called \textit{trinification model}.\\

The most interesting GUT models are the supersymmetric versions, since they provide a much better agreement with the experimental values for the Weinberg angle and the proton lifetime.

\subsubsection{Further Alternatives}
\label{sssec:Alternatives}

We mention a couple of alternatives to supersymmetric theories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Brane-world and large extra-dimensions - } The possibility that there exist more dimensions than those that we naively observe is a very old idea. In the '20s in fact, T. Kaluza and O. Klein attempted to unify gravity with electromagnetism by postulating the existence of a circular fifth dimension~\cite{Kaluza:1921tu, Klein:1926tv}, whose radius is small enough to escape the detection. The idea of extra-dimensions turns out to be completely natural in string theory, where there are six curled up extra-dimensions, which are usually assumed to be very small. There is a further alternative, according to which extra-dimensions are large enough to be in the detection range of the LHC, called \textit{Brane-World Scenario}. In this scenario the SM particles are confined in a four-dimensional subspace of a higher-dimensional space-time. Such a subspace is called \textit{brane}. On the other hand, gravitons can move freely in the full higher dimensional space-time, so that in this picture the weakness of the gravitational interaction with respect to the other forces can be explained by its dilution \cite{Witten:1996mz}. For example, assuming that there exist $n$ extra-dimensions compactified to circles with radii $R$, then the Planck scale can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PlanckScaleBraneWorld}
M_{\rm P}^2 = 8 \pi M^2 (2 \pi R)^n\,,
\end{align}
where $M$ is the $(n+4)$-dimensional Planck scale. The hierarchy problem can be addressed by assuming a large $R$, so that the value of $M$ is lowered to $1 \,$ TeV. Unfortunately the large value of $R$ has not a dynamical explanation in this scenario.


\item \textit{Strong dynamics - } A possible alternative solution to the hierarchy problem is by assuming that the higgs field is not an elementary particle, but a bound state resulting from some yet-unknown strong dynamics~\cite{Dimopoulos:1979qi}. In this picture the hierarchy between $M_{\rm EW}$ and $M_{\rm P}$ can be explained in the same way as the hierarchy in eq. \eqref{eq:ProtonVsPlanckMass} between the proton mass $m_{\rm p}$ and the Planck scale $M_{\rm P}$. Models of physics beyond the SM built following the idea that some strong dynamics is hiding behind the higgs boson usually go under the name of \textit{Technicolor Models}. Despite their attractiveness, these models do not seem to feature phenomenological viable patterns for fermion masses and mixings.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Beyond the Standard Model of Cosmology}
\label{ssec:BSMCosmology}

Despite its undeniable success, the Standard Model of cosmology contains many problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Initial singularity - } Tracing back the scale factor $a(t)$ using the Einstein's equation, in the Standard Model of cosmology it inevitably ends up in a singularity: all the energy of the universe is supposed to be concentrated in a single point at $t = 0$. This is a clear signal of the breakdown of General Relativity in the very early universe, when the energy was concentrated in such a small region that both quantum mechanics and gravity had important effects. This problem can only be cured within a quantum theory of gravity.
\item \textit{Horizon problem - } The high uniformity of the CMB temperature is unexplained within the Hot Big Bang Theory: tracing back the evolution of the universe just using General Relativity and the Standard Model, it is possible to check that at photon decoupling there were many patches that could have never been in causal contact.
\item \textit{CMB anisotropies - } As we discussed in Sec.~\ref{ssec:StandardModelCosmology} the uniformity of the CMB is astonishing: anisotropies in its temperature have a tiny size with respect to the background temperature $T_0$: $\frac{\delta T}{T_0} \sim 10^{-5}$. However, such deviations from uniformity can not be produced within the Standard Model of cosmology.
\item \textit{Flatness problem - } As we mentioned in Sec.~\ref{ssec:StandardModelCosmology}, the universe today appears to be extremely flat, with $\left|\Omega_{\rm curv}\right| < 0.005$. However, even a tiny curvature in the very early universe would have increased to large values at present time, so that a huge fine-tuning of order $\frac{\rho_{\rm curv}}{\rho_c}(t_{\rm Planck}) \sim 10^{-61}$ is required in order satisfy the current bounds.
\item \textit{Monopole problem - } According to GUT theories, topological defects such as monopoles have been created in the early universe. Since they are stable objects, they should be still present to date in such a quantity that they would dominate the energy density of the universe. However, experimental searches for topological defect have failed, setting stringent bounds on their energy density in the universe.
\end{enumerate}

Finally we should emphasize that the thermal cosmological history depicted in Sec.~\ref{ssec:StandardModelCosmology} is completely understood and experimentally tested only from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on. In particular
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a unification mechanism as in GUT theories, additional phase transitions may have occurred in the universe, provided that it was reheated to a sufficiently high temperature.
\item There are several mechanisms proposed for baryogenesis, but none of them has found an experimental validation. It is commonly accepted that baryogenesis happened at some stage after inflation, since otherwise the baryon asymmetry would have been smoothed out by the exponential expansion of the universe. In order to get baryon asymmetry the \textit{Sakharov conditions} have to be met~\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}: \textit{i)} baryon number violation, \textit{ii)} $C$ and $CP$ violation, \textit{iii)} thermal non-equilibrium (or CPT violation). Among the several mechanisms for baryogenesis we mention the \textit{electroweak mechanism}~\cite{Rubakov:2002fi, Kuzmin:1985mm, Kolb:1990vq}, which makes use of the non-perturbative baryon and lepton number violation in the SM, the \textit{GUT mechanism}, which exploits the baryon and lepton number violation intrinsic in GUT theories, and the \textit{Affleck-Dine mechanism}~\cite{Affleck:1984fy}, which utilizes the dynamics of MSSM flat directions to develop a baryon asymmetry. Interestingly, in \cite{ADB} the authors realized a string theory embedding of the Affleck-Dine mechanism. All the proposed mechanisms (including the electroweak one) make use of physics beyond the Standard Model.
\item It is commonly accepted that the decoupling of neutrinos at a temperature of about $1 \,$ MeV gave rise to a neutrino background similar to the CMB\footnote{Assuming that the universe was reheated at a temperature larger than $1\,$ MeV.}, but with a smaller temperature of about $T_{\nu, 0} \simeq 1.95 \,$ K. Unfortunately, it is very hard to observe the cosmic neutrino background, due to the weakness of neutrino interactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inflation}
\label{sssec:Inflation}

Problems 2., 3., 4., 5. in the previous list can all be cured at once by assuming that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion at very early stages, when the age of the universe was about $t_{\rm inf} \sim 10^{-34} \,$ sec~\cite{Guth:1980zm, Linde:1981mu, Albrecht:1982wi}. Such period is called \textit{inflation}. Inflation explains the uniformity of CMB temperature since, in this picture, regions of the universe which apparently have never talked to each other, were in causal contact in the very early stages before the accelerated expansion. Inflation provides also a fascinating explanation to the origin of the anisotropies observed in the CMB~\cite{Mukhanov:1990me, Gorbunov:2011zzc}: according to the inflationary paradigm quantum fluctuations taking place in the universe during inflation have been stretched out by the accelerated expansion, resulting in the tiny anisotropies observed in the CMB temperature~\cite{Ade:2015xua, Ade:2015lrj}. Interestingly, also the presence of large scale structures in the universe can be explained as the result of the evolution of quantum fluctuations in the early universe under the action of inflation: a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe would not give rise to galaxies and stars. Finally, inflation addresses also the flatness and monopole problems, since the accelerated expansion would drive the universe towards flatness, diluting any possible unwanted relics like topological defects.\\

The simplest model of inflation requires the presence of a scalar field $\phi$, called \textit{inflaton}, minimally coupled to gravity, so that the action reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:InflationLagrangian}
S_{\rm inf} = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{2} \, \mathcal{R} + \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi - V(\phi)\right]\,,
\end{align}
where $V(\phi)$ is the scalar potential. Assuming that the scalar field is homogeneous $\phi(\mathbf{x},t) \equiv \phi(t)$, it behaves like a perfect fluid whose equation of state can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EqStateInflaton}
w_\phi = \frac{p_\phi}{\rho_\phi} = \frac{\dot{\phi}/2 - V}{\dot{\phi}/2 + V}\,.
\end{align}
The equations of motion for the inflaton and for the scale factor read
\begin{align}
\label{eq:InflatonEqMotion}
&\ddot\phi + 3 H \dot\phi + \partial_\phi V = 0 \,, \nonumber \\
&H^2 = \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) \right) \,, \nonumber \\
& \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = H^2 \left(1 - \frac{\dot{\phi}^2}{H^2}\right) \,.
\end{align}
From eq. \eqref{eq:EqStateInflaton} and eq. \eqref{eq:InflatonEqMotion} it can be inferred that a period of accelerated expansion can be sustained for a quite long time if
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SlowRollCondition}
\epsilon = \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{2} \left(\frac{\partial_{\phi}V}{V}\right)^2 \ll 1 \,, \qquad \eta = M_{\rm P}^2 \frac{\partial^2_{\phi, \phi} V}{V} \ll 1 \,.
\end{align}
The conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SlowRollCondition} are called \textit{slow-roll conditions}. In the slow-roll regime the Hubble parameter is almost constant, and the space-time is approximately de Sitter:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:deSitterSlowRoll}
H^2 \approx \frac{V}{3} \sim \text{const.} \,, \qquad a(t) \sim e^{H t} \,,
\end{align}
which corresponds to an exponential expansion.\\

As already mentioned, at the classical level inflation would produce a completely uniform universe, which is not what we observe. The formation of large scale structures and of the anisotropies of the CMB are consequences of the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton $\delta \phi$ and of the metric $\delta g_{\mu \nu}$ around the homogeneous background during inflation (labeled with a bar)
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FieldsFluctuations}
\phi(\mathbf{x}, t) = \overline{\phi}(t) + \delta \phi(\mathbf{x},t) \,, \qquad g_{\mu \nu}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \overline{g}_{\mu \nu} + \delta g_{\mu \nu}(\mathbf{x}, t) \,.
\end{align}
For practical purposes, after having eliminated redundant degrees of freedom, it turns out that there are three relevant perturbations: one scalar perturbation $\mathfrak{R}$ and two tensor perturbations $h = h^+, h^\times$\footnote{+ and $\times$ refer to the two polarizations of a gravitational wave.}. Two important statistical measures of the primordial fluctuations are the power spectra of $\mathfrak{R}$ and $h$, which can be defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PowerSpectraDefinition}
&\Delta_s^2 = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} P_{\mathfrak{R}}(k) \,, \qquad &\langle \mathfrak{R}_{\mathbf{k}} \mathfrak{R}_{\mathbf{k'}} \rangle = (2 \pi)^3 \delta \left(\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k'}\right) P_{\mathfrak{R}}(k) \,, \\
&\Delta_t^2 = \frac{k^3}{\pi^2} P_h(k) \,, \qquad &\langle h_{\mathbf{k}} h_{\mathbf{k'}} \rangle = (2 \pi)^3 \delta \left(\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k'}\right) P_h(k) \,,
\end{align}
where the subscript $\mathbf{k}$ denotes a mode of the Fourier expansion of $\mathfrak{R}$ and $h$, and $k = |\mathbf{k}|$. In the slow-roll approximation, the power spectra turn out to be~\cite{Maldacena:2002vr, Weinberg:2005vy}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PowerSpectra}
\Delta_s^2(k) = \frac{H_*^2}{(2 \pi)^2} \frac{H_*^2}{\dot\phi_*^2} \,, \qquad \Delta_t^2(k) = \frac{8}{M_{\rm P}^2} \left(\frac{H_*}{2 \pi}\right)^2 \,,
\end{align}
where the subscript $*$ denotes that the quantities have been computed at the horizon exit of a given mode $k$: $k = a_* H_*$. Given that the amplitude of scalar perturbations has been measured to be $\Delta_s^2 \sim 10^{-9}$, it is possible to define the \textit{tensor-to-scalar ratio} $r$
\begin{align}
r = \frac{\Delta_t^2}{\Delta_s^2} \,,
\end{align}
in terms of which the energy scale of inflation reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EnergyScaleInflation}
V^{1/4} \simeq \left(\frac{r}{0.01}\right)^{1/4} \, 10^{16} \, \rm GeV \,.
\end{align}
For a detailed survey of the observed values of the inflationary parameters we refer to the Planck 2015 analysis~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}, where it is shown that the tensor-to-scalar ratio is bounded to be $r \lesssim 0.1$, while the scalar spectrum is nearly scale invariant, with a value for the spectral index $n_s$ close to unity
\begin{align}
n_s = 1 + \frac{d \ln \Delta_s^2}{d \ln k} \simeq 0.96\,.
\end{align}

We shall emphasize that inflation is still an hypothesis, whose predictions have been repeatedly confronted and found to be in agreement with cosmological observations. Among these we would like to recall the impressive agreement between the predicted angular power spectrum of CMB temperature fluctuations and the observed one. The most striking correspondence between observations and inflationary predictions is probably the fact that all the Fourier modes of perturbations generated during inflation have the same phase~\cite{Dodelson:2003ft, Baumann:2009ds}. Such observation is sufficient to rule out many competing alternatives to inflation.

\section{String Theory}
\label{sec:StringTheory}

All the alternatives for the physics beyond the Standard Model described so far have been inspired by the principle of naturalness and by the search for the unification of forces, but they do not provide a new conceptual framework in which gravity can be conciliated with quantum mechanics. To date, the most promising candidate as a theory of quantum gravity is \textit{string theory}. In a first approach string theory can be defined as a theory in which the elementary objects are not point-like as in particle physics, but rather they are one-dimensional objects with typical length $\ell_s$, sweeping out a two-dimensional surface, called the \textit{worldsheet} $\Sigma$. Since strings have not been observed in particle accelerators, it is necessary to assume that $\ell_s$ is smaller than the scales currently explored in experiments. Different patterns of vibration of the strings effectively produce the crowd of particles of the SM or extensions thereof.\\

Interestingly, the quantization of string theory produces the unavoidable presence of a spin-two particle in the massless spectrum~\cite{Scherk:1974ca}, which behaves like a graviton: gravity is naturally included in string theory at the quantum level. The reason why string theory works nicely as a theory of quantum gravity is intuitive: the typical length $\ell_s$ acts as an intrinsic cut-off for the theory, eliminating the divergences encountered in the straightforward quantization of General Relativity. Furthermore, although not completely clear at a first glance, string theory potentially contains also all the building blocks necessary to reproduce the SM in the low-energy limit, such as non-abelian gauge interactions, chiral fermions in three families, and so on. For this reason string theory is supposed to be a framework in which all the interactions can be finally unified into a single description. A further nice feature of string theory is that it does not contain any unknown external parameter except the string length $\ell_s$, so that all the SM parameters (like the number of generations, the Yukawa couplings, etc.) have to be determined by the dynamics of the theory itself. On the cosmological side, inflation can be naturally accommodated in the low-energy limit of string theory, since it contains many fundamental scalar fields which can play the role of the inflaton. More in detail, all the alternative scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology described in Sec.~\ref{sec:BSM} can be potentially embedded in string theory as low-energy effective field theories. However, a honest statement about the state of the art is that a completely consistent model which reproduces all the experimentally established observations has not been found to date, although we much progress has been made in the last years.

\subsection{Basic Facts About Strings}
\label{ssec:BasicsOfStrings}

Strings naturally come in two types: open strings, with two free end-points, and closed strings, with no end-points. They respectively sweep out worldsheets with and without boundaries. The two-dimensional worldsheet $\Sigma$ swept out by strings can be locally parametrized by the coordinates $(\tau, \sigma)$. $\Sigma$ embeds in a generically $D$-dimensional space-time through a set of functions $X^M(\tau, \sigma)$, where $M = 0, \dots, D-1$. The dynamics of strings is described by the Polyakov action~\cite{Polchinski:1998rq, Green:1987sp}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PolyakovAction}
S_{\rm P} = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \alpha'} \int_\Sigma d^2x \, \sqrt{- \det{g}}\, g^{ab}(\tau, \sigma) \partial_a X^M \partial_b X^N \eta_{MN} \,, \qquad a = 1,2 \,,
\end{align}
where $g_{ab}$ is a metric on $\Sigma$ and $\eta_{MN}$ is the Minkovski metric on the $D$-dimensional space-time, while $\ell_s = 2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}$. The Polyakov action in eq. \eqref{eq:PolyakovAction} features several symmetries:
\begin{itemize}
\item global $D$-dimensional space-time Poincar\'e invariance,
\item invariance under two-dimensional local worldsheet coordinate re-parametriza-\\tion,
\item invariance under local rescaling of the two-dimensional metric (Weyl invariance).
\end{itemize}
Fixing the invariance under the local coordinate re-parametrization (light-cone gau-\\ge), it is possible to see that only oscillations orthogonal to the worldsheet are physical, so that the dynamics described by the Polyakov action reduces to that of $D-2$ two-dimensional free massless scalar fields. Solving the equations of motion for this system gives rise to a tower of infinite decoupled harmonic oscillators, which correspond to the oscillations of the string. Finally, the quantization of the system leads to the spectrum of space-time fields in string theory.\\

In the perturbative regime, space-time string interactions can be treated in a way similar to that used in particle physics. Scattering amplitudes between asymptotic states can be computed as a quantum path integral, summing over all the possible topologies of the worldsheet which interpolate between the asymptotic states:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ScatteringAmplitude}
\bra{\text{out}} \text{evolution} \ket{\text{in}} = \sum_{\text{worldsheets}} \int [D X] e^{-S_{\rm P}[X]} \mathcal{O}_{\rm in} \mathcal{O}_{\rm out} \,,
\end{align}
where the \textit{vertex operators} $\mathcal{O}_{\rm in/out}$ encode the information about in and out asymptotic states. Similarly to what happens in particle physics, each ``Feynman diagram'' can be built by combining a set of basic string interactions vertices, each of which is weighted with a suitable power of the string coupling $g_s \ll 1$. Since string theory does not contain external unknown arbitrary parameters except $\ell_s$, $g_s$ has to be dynamically determined by the theory itself. Indeed, it is given by the VEV of a scalar field which is always present in the massless string spectrum, namely the \textit{dilaton} $\phi$:
\begin{align}	
\label{eq:StringCouplingConstant}
g_s = e^{\langle\phi\rangle}\,.
\end{align}
The perturbative expansion for closed strings is obtained by adding handles to the worldsheet, while the expansion for open strings is obtained by adding boundaries. Each ``Feynman diagram'' is weighted in the perturbative expansion by $g_s^{-\chi}$, where $\chi$ is the \textit{genus} of $\chi$ of $\Sigma$, namely
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Euler}
\chi = 2 - 2 g - n_b\,,
\end{align}
for a worldsheet with $g$ handles and $n_b$ boundaries. Given the structure of the basic interaction vertices, closed strings are always present in an interacting theory, while the presence of open strings is not mandatory.\\

Weyl invariance plays a central role in the dynamics of string theory. In fact, the requirement that this symmetry is not an anomalous one in the quantum theory determines the dimension of the space-time $D$. As soon as a non-trivial background is considered (as an example a metric different from Minkovski for the $D$-dimensional space-time), the theory described by the Polyakov action becomes an interacting one and it is not exactly solvable. However, it can be studied perturbatively around the free theory, and the parameter governing the perturbative expansion is $\alpha'/R^2$, where $R$ denotes the typical length-scale of variation of the space-time fields\footnote{Eventually $R$ boils down to be the typical size of the compact space made up of the extra-dimensions.}. As a consequence, string theory in a general background features a double expansion: the \textit{genus-expansion} controlled by $g_s$ and the $\alpha'$\textit{-expansion} governed by $\alpha'/R^2$.

\subsubsection{Spectrum}

In order to get fermions in the spectrum of string theory, it is necessary to consider a generalization of the Polyakov action, such that the two-dimensional theory is supersymmetric. Consequently new fermionic degrees of freedom $\psi^M$ are included as the superpartners of the bosonic fields $X^M$. In this picture, the requirement of Weyl anomaly cancellation fixes the dimension of the space-time to ten. Depending on the way of quantizing it, string theory leads to five different possibilities for the spectrum, whose massless components are summarized in Tab.s~\ref{tab:TypeIIspectrum} and~\ref{tab:HeteroticTypeISpectrum}. Typically, the spectrum is given by a tower of string states, whose spacing is determined by the unique external unknown parameter of the theory
\begin{align}
\label{eq:StringTower}
M_n^2 \simeq n M^2_s \equiv \frac{n}{\ell_s^2} \,,
\end{align}
where $M_s = 1/\ell_s$ is the \textit{string scale}. Since we are interested in the physics taking place at distances larger than the string length, we have to consider the effective field theory of massless string states, corresponding to energies $E \ll M_s$. The acronyms NS and R in Tab.s~\ref{tab:TypeIIspectrum} and~\ref{tab:HeteroticTypeISpectrum} refer to different possibilities for the choice of fermionic boundary conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Neveu-Schwarz (NS): $\psi^i_{\rm L/R}(\tau + \sigma + \ell_s) = - \psi^i_{\rm L/R}(\tau + \sigma)$,
\item Ramond (R): $\psi^i_{\rm L/R}(\tau + \sigma + \ell_s) = \psi^i_{\rm L/R}(\tau + \sigma)$,
\end{enumerate}
where $\psi^i_{\rm L/R}$ denote respectively the the \textit{left-movers} and \textit{right-movers} fermionic degrees of freedom. Boundary conditions can be chosen independently for left- and right-movers, and the two sectors have to be glued together in a way that preserves the modular invariance of the partition function (this step is called GSO projection). Modular invariance is a crucial property of string theory, since it is the underlying mathematical structure which allows it to behave properly as a quantum theory of gravity. More in detail:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Type II string theory -} There are two Type II string theories: Type IIA and Type IIB. Both of them contain only closed strings, and they differ in the way of performing the GSO projection. Left and right sectors are treated on equal footing in Type II string theories: both sectors contain bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. The massless spectrum is divided into four sectors: NSNS, NSR, RNS and RR. The NSNS is common to Type IIA and Type IIB and contains the ten-dimensional metric $g_{MN}$, the dilaton $\phi$ and the two-form field $B_{MN}$. The RR sector contains form-fields, whose degrees are different in Type IIA and Type IIB. Both theories contain two gravitinos and dilatinos, which have opposite chiralities in Type IIA and the same chiralities in Type IIB. In the former case the massless spectrum features a ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ supersymmetry, while in the latter case the massless spectrum features a ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (2,0)$ supersymmetry. Massless spectra coincide with those of the ten-dimensional Type IIA and Type IIB supergravity theories.
\item \textit{Heterotic theories - } Heterotic theories contain only closed strings as well, but in this case left and right sectors are not treated on equal footing: the left sector contains only bosonic degrees of freedom, while the right one contains both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Due to the GSO projection, it turns out that there are two consistent ways to get a modular invariant partition function: in the first case the field $A^a_M$ in Tab.~\ref{tab:HeteroticTypeISpectrum} is the vector potential of a $SO(32)$ gauge theory, while in the second case it is the vector potential of a $E_8 \times E_8$ gauge theory. $\lambda^a_{\dot{\alpha}}$ is the corresponding gaugino. Both $A^a_M$ and $\lambda^a_{\dot{\alpha}}$ transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The massless spectrum contains a single gravitino $\psi_{M\, \alpha}$ and dilatino $\lambda_\alpha$, corresponding to ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supersymmetry.
\item \textit{Type I theory - } Type I theory is a theory of unoriented open and closed strings. Unorientedness is crucial in order to get a consistent theory, since otherwise Type I strings would suffer from RR tadpoles. The field $A_M$ reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:HeteroticTypeISpectrum} is the vector potential of a $SO(32)$ gauge theory, coming from the open sector. $\lambda^a_{\dot \alpha}$ is the corresponding gaugino. Both $A^a_M$ and $\lambda^a_{\dot{\alpha}}$ transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The massless spectrum contains a single gravitino $\psi_{M\, \alpha}$ and dilatino $\lambda_\alpha$, and eventually the theory features a ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supersymmetry, corresponding to Type I supergravity.

\subsection{String Phenomenology}
\label{ssec:StringPhenomenology}

In spite of the fact that string theory is supposed to be a fundamental theory of nature providing a framework in which all the interactions are unified, during the last forty years its study has led to many developments in several areas of physics, and its application goes well beyond that expected from a theory of quantum gravity. The birth of AdS/CFT in 1997 for instance~\cite{Maldacena:1997re, Aharony:1999ti} has made string theory a useful tool to explore corners of physics which apparently are completely disconnected from quantum gravity. For example the AdS/CFT correspondence has applications in condensed matter physics~\cite{Sachdev:2010ch} and in the physics of strong interactions at high temperatures and densities~\cite{Sadeghi:2013zma}. Furthermore, the study of string theory has led to important developments also in mathematics, the most important of which is the discovery of mirror symmetry~\cite{Candelas:1989hd, Greene:1990ud}. Remarkably, using string theory, Strominger and Vafa were able to exactly reproduce the known result for the Bekenstein-Hawking black-hole entropy~\cite{Strominger:1996sh}, giving support to the idea that it is the correct microscopic description of gravity. Consequently, string theory can be fairly described using prof. M. Greene's words: to date string theory is not simply a ``theory of string-like elementary particles'', but rather a

\begin{center}
\textit{magnificent theoretical framework that interrelates a very wide range of topics in physics and mathematics\footnote{Citation taken from~\cite{ConlonBook}.}.}
\end{center}

Nevertheless, string theory is primarily supposed to be a fundamental theory of nature, which is able to unify all the interactions at the quantum level. In order to study the truthfulness of this claim, it is necessary to connect the ten-dimensional picture to the four-dimensional one, which is the goal of the branch of string theory usually referred to as \textit{string phenomenology}~\cite{Ibanez:2012zz}. This is done by assuming that six out of the ten dimensions are curled up to form a compact space, whose typical size is smaller than the distances currently explored in the particle accelerators, so that extra-dimensions escaped the detection so far. As it is intuitive, the four-dimensional physics depends on the details of the geometry and of the topology of the compact space, but unfortunately there are an infinite number of possible choices for it. Given that a selection principle for the compact space is missing so far, it is very difficult to get predictions from string theory. Phenomenological requirements like four-dimensional supersymmetry can help to restrict the choice to a certain class of compact spaces, called \textit{Calabi-Yau} manifolds~\cite{Greene:1996cy, Hubsch:1992nu}, but still there is a huge number of spaces of this kind. Connecting string theory to the real world then seems a quite difficult task.\\

Historically, Heterotic theories have been the first ones to be studied with the intention of connecting the ten-dimensional picture to the real world~\cite{Candelas:1985en, Donagi:2004ia, Greene:1986bm}. This is because they contain non-abelian gauge symmetries in their massless spectrum, and upon compactification they can give rise to a four-dimensional chiral theory. On the other hand Type II theories did not appear that promising at first, since they neither feature a non-abelian sector in their massless spectrum, nor they give rise to chiral theories in four dimensions. Nevertheless, the search for the right compactification space is quite hard in Heterotic theories, since SM fields arise directly from the closed massless string spectrum, whose fields inhabit the whole compact space and depend on its details~\cite{Derendinger:1985kk, Dine:1985rz, Burgess:1995aa, Gukov:2003cy, deWit:1986mwo}. This way of dealing with string phenomenology is usually called \textit{top-down approach}.\\

With the advent of D-branes in 1995~\cite{Polchinski:1995mt}, it was realized that four-dimensional chiral theories can also be obtained in Type II string theories. Indeed, SM fields can arise from the open string sector which is supported by D-branes~\cite{Angelantonj:2002ct}. D-branes also constitute a source for RR fluxes, so that they allow the field strengths for the form-fields to acquire non-vanishing VEVs. Furthermore, with the introduction of D-branes, there is also a major advantage from a technical point of view: since they can be located in small regions of the compact space, interesting physical quantities of the SM arising from them should be independent of the details of the whole compact space. It is then possible to locally build a D-branes configuration which gives rise to a visible sector with the desired phenomenological properties, and eventually embed it into a global compact space in a consistent way~\cite{Blumenhagen:2005mu, Giddings:2001yu, Blumenhagen:2008zz, Verlinde:2005jr, Aldazabal:2000sa}. This is the approach to string phenomenology used in the present thesis, and it is usually referred to as \textit{bottom-up approach}.\\

Given the difficulty of choosing a precise compact space, the best approach to string phenomenology is to look for physical effects which are shared by large classes of compactifications. For instance, regardless of the specific choice of the compact space, all string compactifications come with a large number of gravitationally coupled scalar fields, called \textit{moduli}, which are singlets under the SM gauge group. Such fields are the four-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions. Depending on their masses moduli can play a significant role in the cosmological evolution of the universe, and can give rise to observable effects. It is important to remark that the observation of any of these effects \textit{would not prove the correctness of string theory}. This in fact can only be established either by the direct observation of strings or by the observation of a physical effect which can arise exclusively by string theory. Nevertheless, the (non-)observation of physical effects due to moduli can help us to understand whether a given class of models is representative of the physical reality or not, and to drive us towards the right way in the never-ending search for a fundamental theory of nature. On the theoretical side, string theory provides the unique available framework in which one can explicitly test if a given model describing some aspects of nature can be consistently embedded in a quantum theory of gravity.%As an example, in the present work we present an explicit realization of the Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis  in Chap.~\ref{chap:ADB}.

\subsubsection{Effective Action for Type II Closed Superstrings}
\label{sssec:EffectiveActionsTypeII}

As we discussed in the previous section, in the present thesis we use the bottom-up approach to string phenomenology, hence we are interested in Type II string theories. In this section we review some basic facts about their low-energy limit, showing explicitly the effective actions for the closed massless fields in Tab.~\ref{tab:TypeIIspectrum}.\\

In the string frame the bosonic effective action for massless states of Type II string theories takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EffectiveAction}
S_{\rm IIB} = \frac{1}{2 \kappa_{10}^2} \int d^{10}x\,\sqrt{-g} \left[\La_{\rm NSNS} + \La_{\rm RR} + \La_{CS}\right] + S_{\rm loc}\,,
\end{align}
where the term $S_{\rm loc}$ takes into account possible local sources, and $\kappa_{10}^2 = \frac{\ell_s^8}{4 \pi}$. The NSNS term is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EffectiveActionNSNS}
\La_{\rm NSNS} = e^{-2 \phi} \left[R + 4 \partial_M \phi \partial^M \phi - \frac{1}{12} |H_3|^2\right]\,,
\end{align}
where the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond field
\begin{align}
\label{eq:H3Definition}
H_3 = dB_2 \,,
\end{align}
is a three-form. The RR piece takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EffectiveActionRR}
\La_{\rm RR} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_p \frac{1}{p!} |F_p|^2 \,,
\end{align}
where $p = 0, 2, 4$ in Type IIA, while $p = 1, 3, 5$ in Type IIB. $F_p$ are the field strengths (also called \textit{fluxes}) of the RR forms, defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FluxesFirstConvention}
F_p = \hat{F}_p - H_3 \wedge C_{p-3} \,,
\end{align}
where $\hat{F}_p = dC_{p-1}$. In Type IIB $F_5$ is constrained to be self-dual:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:F5SelfDuality}
F_5 = *_{10} F_5 \,.
\end{align}
Finally the Chern-Simons term can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CSAction}
\La_{\rm CS, IIA} = -\frac{1}{2} B_2 \wedge F_4 \wedge F_4 \,,\\
\La_{\rm CS, IIB} = -\frac{1}{2} C_4 \wedge H_3 \wedge F_3 \,.
\end{align}

It is useful to introduce an alternative convention for the RR fields, called the \textit{democratic formulation}~\cite{Bergshoeff:2001pv}. This convention consists in replacing eq. \eqref{eq:EffectiveActionRR} with
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EffectiveActionRRDemocratic}
\La_{\rm RR} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_p |F_p|^2\,,
\end{align}
where $p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10$ in Type IIA, and $p = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9$ in Type IIB. In order to halve the propagating degrees of freedom, it is necessary to impose a self-duality constraint:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:RRSelfDuality}
F_p = \left(-1\right)^{\rm{Int}\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)} *_{10} F_{10-p} \,,
\end{align}
which automatically includes the constraint on $F_5$ in eq. \eqref{eq:F5SelfDuality}.\\

Gauge transformations of form-fields, which leave the fluxes invariant, can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GaugeTransformations}
B_2 \rightarrow B'_2 = B_2 + d \lambda_1 \,, \quad C_p \rightarrow C^{'}_p = C_p + d \lambda_{p-1} - H_3 \wedge \lambda_{p-3} \,,
\end{align}
where $\lambda_k$ denotes a $k$-form. Equations of motion and Bianchi identities for fluxes are reported in Sec.~\ref{ssec:BasicFluxes}.


\chapter{Flux Compactifications and Model Building}
\label{chap:Compactifications&ModelBuilding}

As we have pointed out in Sec.~\ref{ssec:BasicsOfStrings}, in the present thesis we use the bottom-up approach to string phenomenology. We consider Type II String Theories, in which SM gauge interactions take place on D-branes localized in a small region of the compact space~\cite{Ibanez:2012zz, Aldazabal:2000sa}. Roughly, in these constructions it is possible to separate global issues (i.e. moduli stabilization) from local ones (i.e. the search for a D-branes configuration reproducing the MSSM or proper extensions thereof) as we will describe more accurately in Sec.~\ref{ssec:VisibleSector}.\\

We have already observed in Sec.~\ref{ssec:BasicsOfStrings} that the quantization of string theory gives rise naturally to the string scale, defined as
\begin{align}
M_s = \frac{1}{\ell_s} \,,
\end{align}
which is the only external unknown parameter of string theory and determines the spacing of the tower of string states. In order to connect string theory with the real world, we are interested in the physics taking place at energies below the string scale (or equivalently, at distances larger than the string length $\ell_s$)
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SUGRAApproximation}
E \ll M_s\,,
\end{align}
so that only massless modes of the string spectrum are excited. As pointed out in Sec.~\ref{ssec:BasicsOfStrings}, massless fields of Type II string spectra correspond to Type II Supergravity spectra, so that eq.~\eqref{eq:SUGRAApproximation} is called \textit{supergravity approximation}. Supergravity spectra and the corresponding effective actions of Sec.~\ref{ssec:StringPhenomenology} are the starting point for the compactification procedure.\\

Given the nice features of $\mathcal{N} = 1$ four-dimensional supersymmetry that we reviewed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:SUSY}, we look for a class of compactifications which preserve $\mathcal{N} = 1$ in four dimensions. In the first part of the present chapter, Sec.~\ref{sec:FluxCompactifications}, we briefly review the properties that such a compact space has to satisfy, starting from the most generic possibility and showing how phenomenological arguments along with our poor computational skills restrict the choice of the internal space to a very specific kind of manifolds. We conclude the section by reporting the effective action for the four-dimensional effective theory which arises from the compactification. In the second part of the chapter, Sec.~\ref{sec:ModelBuilding}, we recall basic notions about D3-branes at singularities, which represent the D-branes setup used in the present thesis to embed the visible sector into string compactifications. We conclude the section with an explicit example of a consistent string compactification.

\section{Flux Compactifications}
\label{sec:FluxCompactifications}

The first phenomenological requirement that we ask for is the maximal symmetry of the four-dimensional space, which allows us to write the most general expression for the ten-dimensional metric in the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GeneralMetric}
ds^2 = e^{2 A(y)} \tilde{g}_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + g_{mn} dx^m dx^n \,,
\end{align}
where $e^{2 A(y)}$ is the \textit{warp-factor}, which depends only on the internal coordinates collectively denoted by $y$. $\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}$ is a maximally symmetric four-dimensional metric and $g_{mn}$ is a six-dimensional metric on the internal space. Maximal symmetry of the four-dimensional space restricts the choice of $\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}$ to a Minkovski, dS$_4$ or AdS$_4$ metric. Greek indexes $\mu, \nu$ refer to four-dimensional coordinates, while italic indexes $m, n$ refer to internal coordinates.\\

In order not to break the maximal symmetry of the four-dimensional space, the VEVs of all the fermionic fields have to vanish. Furthermore, in order to have unbroken supersymmetry in four dimensions, it is also required that the VEVs of the supersymmetric variations of the fermionic fields vanish. In Type II theories there are two gravitinos $\psi_M^A$ ($A = 1,2$) and two dilatinos $\lambda^A$ ($A = 1,2$), where uppercase italic indexes $M, N$ refer to ten-dimensional coordinates. Given these phenomenological requirements, two possibilities can be explored. In Sec.~\ref{ssec:CYCompactifications} we review the simplest one of them, leaving the analysis of the most generic possibility to the subsequent sections.

\subsection{Calabi-Yau Compactifications}
\label{ssec:CYCompactifications}

In the simplest case, only the metric has a non-trivial background along the internal space $\chi$~\cite{Candelas:1985en}. Demanding vanishing VEVs for the supersymmetric variations of the gravitinos and the dilatino leads to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SUSYconditionFluxlessCase}
\langle \delta \psi_M^A \rangle = \nabla_M \epsilon^A\,, \qquad \langle \delta \lambda^A \rangle = \slashed{\partial} \phi \, \epsilon^A \,,
\end{align}
where the slash denotes a contraction with a ten-dimensional gamma matrix: $\slashed{\partial} = \partial_M \Gamma^M$\footnote{$\Gamma$ denotes the ten-dimensional chirality matrix. For the expressions involving spinors in higher dimensions we refer to Appendix B of~\cite{Polchinski:1998rr}.}, while $\epsilon^A$ are the parameters of the supersymmetric transformation.\\

It is a well known result that Type II string compactifications with a non-trivial background only for the metric along the internal manifold lead to an unwarped Minkovski four-dimensional space, with a Calabi-Yau manifold as internal space \cite{Candelas:1985en}. Indeed, the first condition in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYconditionFluxlessCase} translates into the requirement of the existence of two covariantly constant spinors on the ten-dimensional space-time
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CovariantlyConstantSpinor}	
\nabla_M \epsilon^A = 0 \,,
\end{align}
whose four-dimensional component reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:UnwarpedCYFluxlessCase}
k + \nabla_m A \nabla^m A = 0\,.
\end{align}
The solution of eq. \eqref{eq:UnwarpedCYFluxlessCase} on a compact space is $A = 0$, which implies a vanishing four-dimensional curvature $k = 0$. On the other hand, in order to study the constraints arising from the internal components of eq. \eqref{eq:CovariantlyConstantSpinor}, it is necessary to decompose $\epsilon^A$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIA}
\epsilon^1_{\text{IIA}} = \xi^1_+ \otimes \eta_+ \oplus \xi^1_- \otimes \eta_- \,, \nonumber \\
\epsilon^2_{\text{IIA}} = \xi^2_+ \otimes \eta_- \oplus \xi^2_- \otimes \eta_+\,,
\end{align}
in the Type IIA case, such that $\Gamma \epsilon^1_{\text{IIA}} = \epsilon^1_{\text{IIA}}$ and $\Gamma \epsilon^2_{\text{IIA}} =- \epsilon^2_{\text{IIA}}$, where $\xi^{1,2}_- = \left(\xi^{1,2}_+\right)^*$ and $\eta_- = \left(\eta_+\right)^*$. $\eta$ is a six-dimensional Weyl spinor, while $\xi$ is a four-dimensional Weyl spinor. We denote both the chiralities under $\Gamma_5$ and under $\gamma$ by the subscripts $\pm$: $\Gamma_5 \xi^A_\pm = \pm \xi_\pm$ and $\gamma \eta_\pm = \pm \eta_\pm$\footnote{$\Gamma_5$ and $\gamma$ are the chirality matrices respectively in four (space-time) and six (internal) dimensions.}. In the Type IIB case instead
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIB}
\epsilon^A_{\text{IIB}} = \xi^A_+ \otimes \eta_+ \oplus \xi^A_- \otimes \eta_-\,, \qquad A= 1,2\,,
\end{align}
so that $\Gamma \epsilon^A_{\text{IIB}} = \epsilon^A_{\text{IIB}}$.\\

As a consequence the internal component of eq. \eqref{eq:CovariantlyConstantSpinor} can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CYCondition}
\nabla_m \eta_\pm = 0 \,,
\end{align}
which implies that the internal manifold $\chi$ has to admit a covariantly constant spinor $\eta$. This constraint can be rephrased into the condition that $\chi$ must have $SU(3)$ holonomy, or equivalently, that it has to be Ricci-flat: $\mathcal{R}_{i \overline{j}} = 0$. Such manifolds are called \textit{Calabi-Yau} (CY) spaces \cite{Candelas:1985en}.\\

CY manifolds\footnote{In this thesis we always deal with internal manifolds of complex dimension $3$.} are both complex and \Kahler\footnote{A CY manifold is also symplectic.}, so that we can always choose a complex basis $z^i$ ($i = 1,2,3$) in which the metric has only mixed components. The \Kahler form is defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerForm}
J = i g_{i \overline{j}} dz^i \wedge d\overline{z}^{\overline{j}} \,,
\end{align}
and it is closed: $dJ = 0$. Moreover, a CY manifold possesses a unique closed $(3,0)$-form, which we denote by $\Omega$. In general a CY space can be defined as a \Kahler manifold which admits both a closed, globally defined and non-vanishing $(3,0)$-form $\Omega$ and a closed, globally defined and non-vanishing $(1,1)$-form $J$. These can be written also in terms of the covariantly constant spinor $\eta$ which satisfies eq. \eqref{eq:CYCondition}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:JandOmegaEta}
J_{ij} = \mp 2i \eta^\dagger_\pm \Gamma_{ij} \eta_\pm\,, \qquad \Omega_{ijk} = -2i \eta^\dagger_- \Gamma_{ijk} \eta_+\,.
\end{align}
The entire cohomology structure can be summarized in the Hodge diamond for CY manifolds, which takes the form
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
&  &  & h^{(0,0)} &  &  &  \\
&  & h^{(1,0)} &  & h^{(0,1)} &  &  \\
& h^{(2,0)} &  & h^{(1,1)} &  & h^{(0,2)} &  \\
h^{(3,0)} &  & h^{(2,1)} &  & h^{(1,2)} &  & h^{(0,3)} \\
& h^{(3,1)} &  & h^{(2,2)} &  & h^{(1,3)} &  \\
&  & h^{(3,2)} &  & h^{(2,3)} &  &  \\
&  &  & h^{(3,3)} &  &  &
\end{array}
=
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
&  &  & 1 &  &  &  \\
&  & 0 &  & 0 &  &  \\
& 0 &  & h^{(1,1)} &  & 0 &  \\
1 &  & h^{(1,2)} &  & h^{(1,2)} &  & 1 \\
& 0 &  & h^{(1,1)} &  & 0 &  \\
&  & 0 &  & 0 &  &  \\
&  &  & 1 &  &  &
\end{array}
\label{eq:HodgeDiamond}
\end{align}
\end{small}
The first observation is that on a CY manifold the only undetermined $h^{(i,j)}$ are $h^{(1,1)}$ and $h^{(1,2)}$. This feature considerably simplifies the compactification procedure. Since there are not harmonic one-forms and harmonic five-forms, then $J \wedge \Omega = 0$. Furthermore, since $h^{(3,0)} = 1$ there is a unique $\Omega$, and then $\Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}$ and $J \wedge J \wedge J$ have to be proportional:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ConventionJOmega}
J \wedge J \wedge J = \frac{3 i}{4} \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}\,.
\end{align}

Unfortunately CY compactifications feature the presence of many massless scalar fields in the low-energy spectrum, which are called moduli and span a manifold called \textit{moduli space}. They are related to the possible deformations of the size and of the shape of the sub-manifolds of the internal space which do not cost any energy, and manifest themselves in the EFT as flat directions of the scalar potential. In order to infer the structure of the moduli space it is necessary to look for deformations $h_{ij}$ of the background metric $\langle g_{i \overline{j}} \rangle$ which preserve the Ricci-flat condition
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DeformationRicciFlat}
\mathcal{R}(\langle g_{i \overline{j}} \rangle + h_{ij}) = 0 \,.
\end{align}
Since we are not interested in deformations which can be re-absorbed through a general coordinate transformation, it is necessary to fix the gauge, for instance by imposing $\nabla^i h_{ij} = 0$. Such deformations can be divided into two categories:	
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deformations with mixed indexes $h_{i \overline{j}}$: eq. \eqref{eq:DeformationRicciFlat} implies that $\Delta h_{i \overline{j}} = 0$, namely $h_{i \overline{j}}$ is a harmonic $(1,1)$-form. The number of linearly independent deformations with mixed indexes then is counted by the Hodge number $h^{(1,1)}$, and they correspond to different choices of the \Kahler class. It is possible to expand the deformation
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerModuli}
h_{i \overline{j}} = i \sum_{I = 1}^{h^{(1,1)}} t^I(x) \left(\omega_I\right)_{i \overline{j}} \,,
\end{align}
where $\omega_I$ is a basis of harmonic $(1,1)$-forms. The fields $t^I(x)$ are real scalar fields, called \textit{\Kahler moduli} and they depend only on the four-dimensional coordinates. In order to ensure that the resulting metric is positive definite the following conditions have to be imposed
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerConeCondition}
\int_{\gamma \in \chi} J > 0 \,, \quad \int_{\Sigma \in \chi} J \wedge J > 0 \,, \quad \int_{\chi} J \wedge J \wedge J > 0 \,,
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ denotes any curve in $\chi$ and $\Sigma$ denotes any surface in $\chi$. The conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerConeCondition} define a cone in the linear space spanned by $t^I$, which is called \textit{\Kahler cone} or \textit{\Kahler moduli space}.
\item Deformations with non-mixed indexes $h_{ij}$: eq. \eqref{eq:DeformationRicciFlat} implies that $\Delta h_{ij} = 0$, which means that $h_{ij}$ is a harmonic $(2,0)$-form. Since CY manifolds feature $h^{(2,0)} = 0$, it is useful to relate this kind of deformations to $(1,2)$-forms as follows
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ComplexStructureDeformations}
h_{ij} = \sum_{A = 1}^{h^{(1,2)}} \frac{i}{||\Omega||^2} \overline{U}^A(x) \left(\overline{\chi}_A\right)_{i \overline{i} \overline{j}} {\Omega^{\overline{i} \overline{j}}}_j \,,
\end{align}
where $\chi_A$ is a basis of $H^{(1,2)}$, $\Omega$ is the holomorphic $(3,0)$-form and $||\Omega||^2 = \frac{1}{3!} \Omega_{ijk} \overline{\Omega}^{ijk}$. The four-dimensional fields $U^A$ are called \textit{complex structure moduli}, since they parametrize deformations of the complex structure. This can be understood as follows: as soon as we deform the metric with $h_{ij}$, in order for the new metric to be \Kahler, there must be a basis in which it can be written with mixed indexes components only. Since holomorphic transformations do not affect the index structure, the only transformation that can remove non-mixed components is a transformation of the complex structure.\\
\end{enumerate}

The presence of such massless fields is strongly disliked from a phenomenological point of view, for a couple of reasons. The first one is that they would mediate long distance interactions, which are not observed in nature. The second one is that since all the parameters of the four-dimensional EFT depend on the VEVs of the moduli, without fixing them it would be impossible to get predictions from string theory.\\

Finally, a few words about four-dimensional supersymmetry in Type II CY compactifications. Starting from a ten dimensional spinor, it is possible to decompose its $\mathbf{16}$ representation as\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
$SO(10)$ & $\longrightarrow$ & $SO(6) \times SO(1,3)$ & $\longrightarrow$ & $SU(3) \times SO(1,3)$ \\
$\mathbf{16}$ &  & $(\mathbf{4},\mathbf{2}) + (\mathbf{\overline{4}},\mathbf{2'})$ & \empty  & $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2}) + (\mathbf{\overline{3}},\mathbf{2'}) + (\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2}) + (\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2'}) \,$,
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.4cm}
which implies that the four-dimensional theory preserves a $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry, given that there are two ten-dimensional gravitinos both in Type IIA and in Type IIB. $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry in four dimensions is strongly unwelcome, since it does not lead to a chiral theory and then it precludes the possibility of getting a realistic four-dimensional low-energy theory. Consequently, additional ingredients are needed in the compactification, in order to break supersymmetry further to $\mathcal{N} = 1$.

\subsection{Basic Definitions About Fluxes}
\label{ssec:BasicFluxes}

An alternative which has been extensively studied in the last decade is the possibility to allow for a non-trivial background also for some of the ten-dimensional $p$-forms fields of the massless string spectrum, in addition to the metric. Such compactifications are called \textit{flux compactifications} (see ~\cite{Grana:2005jc, Douglas:2006es, Blumenhagen:2006ci} and references therein). It turns out that fluxes back-react on the geometry of the compact space, so that Calabi-Yau manifolds are no longer solutions of the supersymmetry conditions, and it is necessary to re-analyze the constraints coming from requiring vanishing VEVs for the supersymmetric variations of dilatinos and gravitinos. The solutions to these requirements, supplemented by the request of breaking half of the supersymmetry from $\mathcal{N} = 2$ to $\mathcal{N} = 1$ in the four-dimensional EFT, are typically less constrained manifolds, ranging from complex manifolds to conformal Calabi-Yau's. We discuss such solutions in Sec.~\ref{ssec:SUSYConditions}. In addition, the non-trivial background of the form-fields also constrains the shape of the sub-manifolds of the compact space, leading to the stabilization of some of the moduli and giving them a large mass, as we will review in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ModuliStabilization}. Flux compactifications have been extensively studied also in the context of generalized complex geometry~\cite{Hitchin:2004ut, Gualtieri:2007ng, Grana:2004bg, Grana:2005sn, Martucci:2005ht, Martucci:2006ij, Koerber:2007xk, Martucci:2009sf}. In the present section we review some basic notions about fluxes in string theory.\\

In order to preserve the four-dimensional maximal symmetry, fluxes can either be only present along the internal directions of the ten-dimensional space-time, or they have to fill the four-dimensional space-time (which is only possible for four-forms at least). As a consequence the NSNS flux $H_3$ can only be internal, while $F_4$ and $F_5$ can fill the four-dimensional space for Type IIA and Type IIB respectively. In the following we assume that these requirements are satisfied.\\

Bianchi identities for fluxes in the democratic formulation introduced in Sec.~\ref{sssec:EffectiveActionsTypeII} take the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:BianchiIdentities}
d H_3 = 0\,, \qquad d F_p - H_3 \wedge F_{p-2} = 0\,, \qquad \text{(almost everywhere)} \,,
\end{align}
where the note ``almost everywhere'' is to include possible sources. If these are present the right hand side of eq.~\eqref{eq:BianchiIdentities} is modified by delta functions with support on the source world-volume (i.e. D-branes and/or O-planes). In presence of sources $p$-form fields are not well-defined, so that the integral of the corresponding field strength over a cycle can be different from zero, i.e. there is a \textit{non-vanishing flux}. Non-vanishing fluxes can also arise in the absence of sources, as soon as the cycle supporting them is a non-contractible one. In general, non-vanishing fluxes have to obey a Dirac quantization condition, which reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DiracQuantization}
\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^2 \alpha'} \int_{\Sigma_4} H_3 \in \mathbb{Z}\,, \qquad \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}\right)^{p-1}} \int_{\Sigma_p} \hat{F}_p \in \mathbb{Z}\,,
\end{align}
where $\Sigma_p$ denotes a non-contractible $p$-cycle. As a consequence of Hodge and Poincar\'e duality there are as many two-cycles as four-cycles, while three-cycles come in dual pairs, as summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:BasisII} where we also provide a basis for the corresponding (co-)homology groups. $(\alpha_{\hat{A}}, \beta^{\hat{B}})$ form a real, symplectic basis on $H^{(3)}$.\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption[]{\label{tab:BasisII} Basis of the cohomology group of a CY manifold and their Poincar\'e dual non-trivial cycles.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

It is possible to define electric and magnetic fluxes for each field strength as follows
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ElectricMagneticFluxes}
&\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^2 \alpha'} \int_{A_{\hat{A}}} H_3 = m^{\hat{A}}\,, \quad \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^2 \alpha'} \int_{B^{\hat{A}}} H_3 = e_{\hat{A}} \,, \qquad {\hat{A}} = 1, \dots, \frac{h^3}{2} \,,& \nonumber \\
&\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^2 \alpha'} \int_{A_{\hat{A}}} \hat{F}_3 = m^{\hat{A}}_{\rm RR}\,, \quad \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^2 \alpha'} \int_{B^{\hat{A}}} \hat{F}_3 = e_{\text{RR}\, {\hat{A}}} \,,& \\
&\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}} \int_{d_I} \hat{F}_2 = m^I_{\rm RR}\,, \quad \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}\right)^3} \int_{D^I} \hat{F}_4 = e_{\text	{RR}\, I} \,, \quad I = 1, \dots, h^2 \,.& \nonumber
\end{align}
On a CY manifold the relevant cohomology groups decompose as
\begin{align}
H^{(3)} = H^{(3,0)} \oplus H^{(2,1)} \oplus H^{(1,2)} \oplus H^{(0,3)}\,, \qquad H^{(2)} = H^{(1,1)}\,,
\end{align}
since there are not $(2,0)$ or $(0,2)$-forms. Note that we did not define the integrals of $\hat{F}_1$ and $\hat{F}_5$ because there are not non-trivial one- and five-cycles in CY manifolds. Poincar\'e dualities are encoded in the following relations
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PoincareDuals}
\int_{A_{\hat{B}}} \alpha_{\hat{A}} = \int_{\chi} \alpha_{\hat{A}} \wedge \beta^{\hat{B}} = - \int_{B^{\hat{A}}} \beta_{\hat{B}} = \delta^{\hat{B}}_{\hat{A}}\,, \nonumber \\
\int_{d_J} \omega_I = \int_{\chi} \omega_I \wedge \tilde{\omega}^J = - \int_{D^I} \tilde{\omega}^J = \delta^J_I\,.
\end{align}

\subsection{Supersymmetry Conditions}
\label{ssec:SUSYConditions}

In the presence of non-vanishing fluxes the supersymmetry conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYconditionFluxlessCase} get much more complicated:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes}
\delta& \psi_M^A = \nabla_M \epsilon^A + \frac{1}{4} \slashed{H}_M \mathcal{P} \epsilon^A + \frac{1}{16} e^{\phi} \sum_n \slashed{F}_n \Gamma_M  \mathcal{P}_n \epsilon^A \,, \nonumber \\
\delta \lambda^A &= \left(\slashed{\partial} \phi + \frac{1}{2} \slashed{H} \mathcal{P}\right) \epsilon^A + \frac{1}{8} e^{\phi} \sum_n \left(-1\right)^n \left(5 - n\right) \slashed{F}_n \mathcal{P}_n \epsilon^A \,,
\end{align}
where the $2 \times 2$ matrices $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}_n$ are different in Type IIA and Type IIB. In Type IIA $\mathcal{P} = \Gamma$ and $\mathcal{P}_n = \Gamma^{n/2} \sigma^1$, while for Type IIB $\mathcal{P} = - \sigma^3$ and $\mathcal{P}_n = \sigma^1$ if $\frac{n + 1}{2}$ is even, and $\mathcal{P}_n = i\sigma^2$ if $\frac{n + 1}{2}$ is odd. $\sigma^i$ are the Pauli matrices. The sum runs over $n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10$ for Type IIA, and over $n = 3, 5, 7 , 9$ for Type IIB.\\

Interestingly, supersymmetry conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes} split into two requirements. The first one is a topological requirement, while the second one is a constraint on the differential structure of the compact space. Let us analyze them more in detail.
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] \textit{Topological condition} - The topological condition consists in requiring the existence of a globally well defined non-vanishing spinor. It can be easily understood in terms of the \textit{structure group} of the internal manifold~\cite{Gauntlett:2002fz, Bovy:2005qq, Behrndt:2003uq, Kaste:2003zd, Martelli:2003ki, MacConamhna:2004fb, Gillard:2004xq, Dall'Agata:2004dk}. The structure group of a manifold is the group of transformations required to patch the orthonormal frame bundle in such a way that some structures are preserved on it. For instance, on a Riemannian six-manifold, the structure that has to be preserved is the metric, and this requirement automatically reduces the structure group from the general coordinate transformations group $GL(6)$ to $SO(6)$. As soon as new structures are introduced on the manifold, further restrictions on the structure group take place. In the case of string compactifications, as long as we require some preserved supersymmetry in four dimensions, or even in the case in which all the supersymmetries are spontaneously broken by fluxes in the four-dimensional EFT, supercurrents have to be globally well defined on the compactification space. This means that the internal manifold must admit as many globally defined spinors as the number of supercurrents is. A globally well defined non-vanishing spinor exists only if the structure group of the compact space is reduced to $SU(3)$. This can be easily understood, since the spinor representation in six dimensions is in the $\mathbf{4}$ of $SO(6) \simeq SU(4)$. Under $SU(3)$ this can be decomposed as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorDecompositionSU3}
\bf{4} \rightarrow \bf{3} + \bf{1} \,,
\end{align}
so that if the structure group is reduced to $SU(3)$, then the orthonormal frame patchings admit a singlet, namely a globally well defined non-vanishing spinor. It is possible to decompose also vectors, two-forms and three-forms under $SU(3)$, and we get respectively
\begin{align}
\text{Vector}: &\quad &&\bf{6} \, \rightarrow \, \bf{3} + \bf{\overline{3}} \,, \nonumber \\
\text{Two-form}: &\quad &&\bf{15} \, \rightarrow \, \bf{8} + \bf{3} + \bf{\overline{3}} + \bf{1}\,, \nonumber \\
\text{Three-form}: &\quad &&\bf{20} \, \rightarrow \, \bf{6} + \bf{\overline{6}} + \bf{3} + \bf{\overline{3}} + \bf{1} + \bf{1}\,,
\end{align}
from which we realize that there are also a globally well defined non-vanishing real two-form and a globally well defined non-vanishing complex three-form. They correspond to the \Kahler two-form $J$ and to the holomorphic three-form $\Omega$ which are present also in the case of CY manifolds, as we pointed out in Sec.~\ref{ssec:CYCompactifications}. The topological condition leads to the same results as in the fluxless case. A manifold whose structure group is reduced to $SU(3)$ is a $SU(3)$-\textit{structure manifold}~\cite{Kaste:2003dh, Frey:2004rn, Behrndt:2005bv}.
\item[b)] \textit{Differential condition} - The differential condition consists in imposing eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes}. As we have reviewed in Sec.~\ref{ssec:CYCompactifications}, in the fluxless case they boil down to the requirement of reduced $SU(3)$ holonomy for the internal manifold, which is equivalent to require the existence of a covariantly constant spinor such that $\nabla \eta_\pm = 0$ on the compact space. In general on a $SU(3)$-structure manifold, it is possible to find a connection $\Gamma'$ such that the covariant derivative $\nabla'(\Gamma')$ (possibly with a non-vanishing torsion)~\cite{LopesCardoso:2002vpf, Gauntlett:2003cy, Grana:2004sv}
\begin{itemize}
\item is compatible with the metric: $\nabla' g = 0$,
\item has reduced $SU(3)$ holonomy: $\nabla' \eta_\pm = 0$,
\end{itemize}
where $\eta$ is the six-dimensional spinor in eq.s \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIA} and \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIB}. In other words a CY space is a particular example of a $SU(3)$-structure manifold, in which the globally well defined spinor is also covariantly constant with respect to the Levi-Civita connection.
\end{itemize}

The torsion tensor associated with the new connection $\Gamma'$ can be decomposed as	
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TorsionDecomposition}
{T_{mn}}^p \in \Lambda^1 \otimes \left(su(3) \oplus su(3)^{\perp}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $\Lambda^1$ is the space of one-forms and we used the decomposition $so(6) = su(3) \oplus su(3)^{\perp}$. Since its relevant action is on the $SU(3)$-invariant component of $\eta_\pm$, the $su(3)$ piece can be ignored. The corresponding decomposition is called \textit{intrinsic torsion} ${T^0_{mn}}^p$ and takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:IntrinsicTorsion}
T^0_{mn}\,^p \in \Lambda^1 \otimes su(3)^\perp &=& ({\bf 3} \oplus {\bf \bar
3}) \otimes  ({\bf 1} \oplus {\bf 3} \oplus {\bf \bar 3}) \nonumber\\ \\
&=& ({\bf 1} \oplus {\bf 
1}) \oplus  ({\bf 8} \oplus {\bf 8}) \oplus ({\bf 6} \oplus {\bf \bar
6}) \oplus  2 \, ({\bf 3} \oplus {\bf \bar 3} ) \\
&& \quad \mathcal{W}_1 \quad  \quad\quad   \mathcal{W}_2 \quad  \quad\quad \mathcal{W}_3 \quad
\quad \,\, \mathcal{W}_4, \mathcal{W}_5 \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}

$\mathcal{W}_1, \dots, \mathcal{W}_5$ are the five torsion classes appearing in the covariant derivative of the globally well defined spinor, which characterize the differential properties of the $SU(3)$-structure manifold~\cite{Dall'Agata:2004dk, LopesCardoso:2002vpf, Gauntlett:2003cy, Grana:2004sv, Dall'Agata:2003ir}. As inferable from eq. \eqref{eq:IntrinsicTorsion}, $\mathcal{W}_1$ is a complex scalar, $\mathcal{W}_2$ is a complex two-form, $\mathcal{W}_3$ is a real primitive $(1,2) + (2,1)$-form, while $\mathcal{W}_4$ and $\mathcal{W}_5$ are real vectors. Depending on which component of the intrinsic torsion is non-zero, the internal space deviates from being a CY manifold. This can be clearly seen by writing down the exterior derivatives of the \Kahler two-form $J$ and of the holomorphic three-form $\Omega$ in terms of the torsion classes:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dJdOmegaTorsion}
dJ = \frac{3}{2} \text{Im} \left(\overline{\mathcal{W}}_1 \Omega\right) + \mathcal{W}_4 \wedge J + \mathcal{W}_3 \,, \\
d\Omega = \mathcal{W}_1 J \wedge J + \mathcal{W}_2 \wedge J + \overline{\mathcal{W}_5} \wedge \Omega \,.
\end{align}
In the fluxless case we know that the internal space is a CY manifold and that both $J$ and $\Omega$ are closed forms, so that all the torsion classes vanish. A $SU(3)$-structure manifold ranges from being a CY manifold when $\mathcal{W}_1 = \dots = \mathcal{W}_5 = 0$ to being simply a complex manifold when only $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_2 = 0$. In Tab.~\ref{tab:TorsionClasses} we report more details.

\subsubsection*{$\mathcal{N} = 1$ Supersymmetry}
\label{sssec:N1SUSY}

The main message from the previous section is that the presence of fluxes back-reacts on the geometry of the compact space, making some components of the torsion different from zero, so that the manifold is no longer a CY space. Furthermore, non-vanishing fluxes can break supersymmetry. In order to study the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ Minkovski vacua which are compatible with flux compactifications, it is necessary to impose a relation between the four-dimensional spinor $\xi^{A}$ ($A = 1, 2$) in eq.s \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIA} and \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionBareIIB}. The only possible choice which allows to preserve the four-dimensional maximal symmetry is to take the four-dimensional spinors proportional to each other \cite{Grana:2005jc}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorProportionality}
a(y) \xi_+^1 = b(y) \xi_+^2 = \xi_+ \,,
\end{align}
where the proportionality complex functions $a$ and $b$ depend on the internal coordinates $y$. Then it is possible to decompose the ten-dimensional spinors as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorDecompositionIIAN1}
\epsilon^1_{\text{IIA}} = \xi_+ \otimes \left(a \eta_+\right) \oplus \xi_- \otimes \left(\overline{a}\eta_-\right) \,, \nonumber \\
\epsilon^2_{\text{IIA}} = \xi_+ \otimes \left(\overline{b}\eta_-\right) \oplus \xi_- \otimes \left(b \eta_+\right)\,,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SpinorDecompositionIIBN1}
\epsilon^1_{\text{IIB}} = \xi_+ \otimes \left(a \eta_+\right) \oplus \xi_- \otimes \left(\overline{a}\eta_-\right) \,, \nonumber \\
\epsilon^2_{\text{IIB}} = \xi_+ \otimes \left(b \eta_+\right) \oplus \xi_- \otimes \left(\overline{b} \eta_-\right)\,.
\end{align}
Using eq.s \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionIIAN1} and \eqref{eq:SpinorDecompositionIIBN1} to impose the supersymmetry conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes} provides a set of relations between the torsion, the fluxes, the cosmological constant and the warp-factor, which describe how the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric vacuum sits in the underlying $\mathcal{N} = 2$ EFT. One degree of freedom of the complex functions $a$ and $b$ can be fixed by the normalization: $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = e^A$, where $e^{2 A}$ is the warp-factor. A second degree of freedom is redundant and can be fixed by a gauge choice~\cite{Grana:2005jc, Grana:2005sn}, then all $\mathcal{N} = 1$ flux vacua are parametrized by a couple of angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as follows
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VacuaParameterization}
a = e^{A/2} \, \cos \alpha \, e^{i \frac{\beta}{2}}\,, \quad b = e^{A/2} \, \sin \alpha \, e^{-i \frac{\beta}{2}} \,.
\end{align}
In Tab.s~\ref{tab:IIAN1vacua} and~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua} we report the results for Type IIA and Type IIB respectively. We can discuss them separately:

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Type IIA -} In Type IIA, as can be observed in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIAN1vacua}, there are two classes of solutions to the supersymmetry conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(A)] It corresponds to a solution with the NSNS flux and the singlet components of RR fluxes. It features $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_2 = 0$, but $\mathcal{W}_3 \neq 0$ and $\overline{\mathcal{W}}_5 = 2 \mathcal{W}_4 = \overline{\partial} \phi$, meaning that the compact space is complex but it is not even \Kahler or symplectic.
\item[(BC)] It is a solution with only RR fluxes, and $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_3 = \mathcal{W}_4 = 0$, such that the compact space is symplectic. It corresponds to the dimensional reduction of an M-theory solution on a seven-dimensional manifold with $G_2$ holonomy \cite{Kaste:2003dh}. In case of a eleven-dimensional torsion-free $G_2$ structure the internal space becomes a \Kahler manifold, corresponding to the second column of Tab. \ref{tab:IIAN1vacua} with $F_2^{(8)} = 0$.
\end{itemize}
We can conclude that the introduction of fluxes in Type IIA causes a substantial back-reaction on the geometry of the compact space, which deviates significantly from being a CY manifold.
\item \textbf{Type IIB -} In Type IIB there are three\footnote{Actually the classes are four. There is an additional class called (ABC). We refer to~\cite{Grana:2004sv} for more details.} different classes of solutions to the supersymmetry conditions in eq. \eqref{eq:SUSYConditionsWithFluxes}, as shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(A)] This class of solutions is very similar to class (A) of Type IIA. In particular the vanishing torsion classes are again $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_2 = 0$, so that the internal manifold is complex. In Type IIB all components of RR fluxes are zero.
\item[(B)] This class of solutions is the most interesting one. One of its main properties is that it allows for the RR five-form and for both RR and NSNS $3$-forms. The latter are related by a Hodge duality. It is convenient to define the \textit{three-form flux}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:G3Definition}
G_3 = F_3 - i e^{-\phi} H_3 = \hat{F}_3 - \tau H_3 \,,
\end{align}
where $\tau = C_0 + i e^{-\phi}$ is the \textit{axio-dilaton}. The constraint $e^{\phi}F_3^{(6)}=\mp * H_3^{(6)}$ translates into the fact that $G_3$ is \textit{Imaginary Self Dual} (ISD), namely
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ISD}
*_6 G_3 = i G_3 \,.
\end{align}
Finally, since in the class (B) there are not non-vanishing fluxes in the singlet representation, then $G_3^{(0,3)} = 0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(B$_{\rm NF}$)] This sub-class features $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_2 = \mathcal{W}_3 = 0$, and $3 \mathcal{W}_4 = 2 \mathcal{W}_5 = 6 \overline{\partial} A$, so that the manifold is a \textit{conformal Calabi-Yau} space, accordingly to Tab.~\ref{tab:TorsionClasses}. Non-vanishing torsion classes source a slight deviation from a CY space, since the metric can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:WarpedMetric}
ds^2 = e^{2 A} \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + e^{-2 A} \tilde{g}_{mn} dx^m dx^n\,,
\end{align}
where $\tilde{g}_{mn}$ is a CY metric. The \textit{conformal factor} $e^{-2 A}$ is the inverse of the warp-factor and as we will discuss below, in the limit of large volume it can be safely neglected. As a consequence, all the mathematical tools developed for CY compactifications can be used in this case to compute the four-dimensional effective field theory.
\item[(B$_{\rm F}$)] In this case $\mathcal{W}_4 = \mathcal{W}_5$, so the internal manifold is not a conformal CY, even if it is still complex. Furthermore it features a non-constant holomorphic dilaton $\tau$. This class gives rise to F-theory solutions.
\end{itemize}
\item[(C)] This class is S-dual to class (A), hence it has only RR fluxes and the same vanishing torsion classes: $\mathcal{W}_1 = \mathcal{W}_2 = 0$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

We can conclude that as soon as fluxes are introduced into the compactification, they back-react on the geometry so that typically the internal manifold is far from being a CY space. As we argued, the most interesting class of solutions is the Type IIB (B$_{\rm NF}$) class, to which we refer for simplicity as \textit{warped compactifications}~\cite{Giddings:2001yu, Curio:2000dw, Gubser:2000vg, Grana:2000jj, DeWolfe:2002nn, Frey:2003tf}, since it leads to warped (or conformal) CY manifolds. In this case, the conformal factor is the inverse of the warp-factor, and in the large radius limit it can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ConformalFactorLimit}
e^{2 A} \sim 1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{g_s N \alpha'^{2}}{R^4}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $N$ measures the units of three-form flux $G_3$, while $R$ is the radius of the compact space (assuming it is isotropic). Hence, in the large radius limit, corrections to the CY metric can be safely neglected, and the KK reduction can be performed using the mathematical tools we illustrated in Sec.~\ref{ssec:CYCompactifications}. In particular the moduli space can be approximated with that of a CY manifold. Even if this is a very good approximation in the large volume regime, a proper computation of the moduli space should include the warping~\cite{Giddings:2005ff, deAlwis:2003sn, Shiu:2008ry, Douglas:2008jx, Frey:2008xw, Chen:2009zi, Underwood:2010pm, Frey:2013bha, Martucci:2014ska}. In the present thesis we focus on warped compactifications, and we perform computations in the large volume regime, in order to trust the supergravity approximation, so that we can also safely neglect warping effects on the moduli space of the conformal CY manifold.\\

Any additional object introduced in the compactification can further back-react on the geometry, possibly destroying the warped compactification solution. For instance, let us recall what supersymmetries are preserved by sources for fluxes, such as D-branes and O-planes \cite{Polchinski:1998rr}. In general D-branes and O-planes preserve supersymmetries whose transformation parameters are related in the following way
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DbranesSUSY}
\epsilon^1 = \Gamma^\perp \epsilon^2\,,
\end{align}
where $\Gamma^\perp$ denotes the product of ten-dimensional gamma matrices in the directions orthogonal to the source itself. It turns out that in general the product of six or two gamma matrices in euclidean space has eigenvalue $\pm i$, so that D3/D7-branes and O$3$/O$7$-branes preserve supersymmetries of the type $a = \pm ib$. Such supersymmetries correspond exactly to those preserved in warped compactifications, as reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua} (the minus sign is the right one for anti D3-branes). On the other hand the products of $4$ gamma matrices have eigenvalue $\pm 1$, so that D$5$/D$9$-branes and O$5$/O$9$-planes preserve supersymmetries of the class Type IIB (C). For this reason, in this thesis we consider warped compactifications with D3/D7-branes and O$3$/O$7$-branes.

\subsection{Equations of Motion}
\label{ssec:EqOfMotion}

After having determined the class of internal manifolds which admit $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry, we have to check that in such backgrounds the equations of motion of string theory can be satisfied. We have already observed that in the fluxless case, the integrated equations of motion in eq. \eqref{eq:UnwarpedCYFluxlessCase} let us rule out warped CY compactifications. In this section we review some generic constraints arising from the integrated equations of motion in presence of fluxes. As we will observe, the first consequence is the necessity to introduce sources for fluxes in the compactification.\\

The relevant constraints for the ten-dimensional bosonic massless fields of Type IIB strings are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Einstein's equation,
 \item Equation of motion for the dilaton,
 \item Bianchi identities for fluxes,
 \item Equations of motion for fluxes,
 \end{itemize}

As a first step, let us focus on the constraints coming from RR fields. Due to the self-duality constraint in eq. \eqref{eq:RRSelfDuality} it turns out that the equations of motion for the RR fields, which take the form
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:RREquationsOfMotion}
 d\left(*_{10} F_p\right) + H_3 \wedge *_{10} F_{p + 2} = 0\,,
 \end{align}
are contained into the Bianchi identities
\begin{align}
\label{eq:RRBianchiIdentities}
dF_p - H_3 \wedge F_{p-2} = 0\,.
\end{align}
Every time we have to impose differential conditions such as in eq. \eqref{eq:RRBianchiIdentities} on a compact manifold we face with constraints coming from their integrated version, as a consequence of the Gauss' law. The simplest example in quantum field theory arises in presence of a scalar field $\phi$ with a source $J$ on a compact space $\chi$. The equation of motion is of the form $\Box \phi = - J$, hence it constrains the integral of the source to vanish $\int_\chi J = 0$. The same happens when we consider the constraints in eq. \eqref{eq:RRBianchiIdentities}. As reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}, due to supersymmetry $F_3 \sim *_{6} H_3$, and then from eq. \eqref{eq:RRBianchiIdentities} we can immediately infer that the compactification is inconsistent, since the integral of $dF_5$ on the compact space $\chi$ vanishes, while the integral of $H_3 \wedge F_3$ is positive definite. This kind of inconsistency can be avoided in string theory due to the presence of BPS sources, like O3-planes, which contribute to the right hand side of eq. \eqref{eq:RRBianchiIdentities} with the right sign. Including the contributions coming both from D3-branes and from O3-planes, which are sources for the D3-brane density charge, the Bianchi identity reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TadpoleF3}
dF_5 - H_3 \wedge F_3 = \left(2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}\right)^4 \rho^{\text{loc}}_3\,,
\end{align}
where $\rho^{\text{loc}}_3$ is the dimensionless D3 charge density of the localized sources. In general it can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:D3ChargeDensity}
\rho^{\rm loc}_3 = \mu_3 \sum_a \pi^a_6 + \mu_3 Q_3 \sum_a \pi^{a, \rm Op}_6 \,,
\end{align}
where $\pi^a_6$ and $\pi^{a, \rm Op}$ are six-forms Poincar\'e dual to the supports of D3-branes and O3-planes respectively. For D3-branes the coefficient $\mu_3$ is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DpTension}
\mu_3 = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^3 \left(\alpha^{'}\right)^2}\,,
\end{align}
while for a O3-plane $Q_3$ is negative \cite{Giddings:2001yu}. We are finally led to the schematic \textit{tadpole cancellation condition}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TadpoleCancellation}
N_{\text{D3}} - \frac{1}{2} N_{\text{O3}} + \frac{1}{\left(2 \pi\right)^4 \alpha^{'2}} \int_{\chi} H_3 \wedge F_3 = 0\,,
\end{align}
which is a constraint on the number of sources present in the compactifications. In eq. \eqref{eq:TadpoleCancellation} we are neglecting possible contributions to the D3-charge density arising from D7-branes. We will provide more details on tadpole cancellation in a compactification in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}.\\

It is also possible to get a constraint on the geometry of the compact space from the integrated equations of motion in a way which does not make use of the supersymmetry conditions of Sec.~\ref{ssec:SUSYConditions}, but with the only assumption of warped metric as in eq. \eqref{eq:WarpedMetric}\footnote{Here we assume that the metric has the warped form of \eqref{eq:WarpedMetric}, but $\tilde{g}_{mn}$ is not necessarily CY.}~\cite{Giddings:2001yu}. In fact, Poincar\'e invariance and self-duality of $F_5$ constrain the form of $F_5$ itself:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:F5Constrained}
F_5 = (1 + *_{10})\left(d \alpha(y) \wedge dx^0 \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge dx^3\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is a generic function which depends only on the internal coordinates, collectively denoted by $y$. Subtracting from eq. \eqref{eq:F5Constrained} the trace of the non-compact components of the Einstein's equation we get (in the Einstein frame)\footnote{A $\widetilde{}$ denotes quantities computed using the metric $\widetilde{g}$ in eq. \eqref{eq:WarpedMetric}.}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EOMConstraint}
\tilde{\nabla}^2 \left(e^{4A} - \alpha\right) =&\, \frac{e^{2A + \phi}}{6} |*_6 G_3 - i G_3|^2 + e^{-6A} |\partial\left(e^{4A} - \alpha\right)|^2 + \nonumber\\
&+ (4 \pi^2 \alpha')^4 e^{2A} \left[\frac{1}{2} \left(T^i_i - T^\mu_\mu\right)^{\rm loc} - T_3 \rho_3^{\rm loc}\right] \,,
\end{align}
where $T_{ij}$ is the stress tensor of the localized sources defined in the usual way as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:StressTensorSources}
T_{ij} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta S_{\rm loc}}{\delta g^{ij}} \,.
\end{align}
Since the left-hand-side of eq. \eqref{eq:EOMConstraint} has to vanish upon integration on a compact space, we can observe that a warped compactification to a four-dimensional Minkovski space is possible only if:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the warp-factor and the five-form potential are related: $e^{4A} = \alpha$,
 \item $G_3$ is ISD: $*_6 G_3 = i G_3$,
 \item the BPS condition $\frac{1}{2} \left(T^i_i - T^\mu_\mu\right)^{\rm loc} = T_3 \rho_3^{\rm loc}$ holds, where $T_3 = \left(2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}\right)^{-4}$ is the D3-brane tension.
\end{enumerate}
Condition 3. holds for BPS objects like D3-branes and O3-planes. Also D7-branes satisfy this condition, since as we have previously observed, they preserve the same $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry of D3-branes. Condition 1. implies that the five-form $F_5$ is constrained to be of the same form as in warped compactifications of Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}, while condition 2. ensures that the three-form $G_3$ has to be ISD, again as in warped compactifications. We infer that the constraints from the equations of motion in case of a warped metric as in eq. \eqref{eq:WarpedMetric} lead almost to the same background geometry that we got from supersymmetry conditions, assuming that all the localized sources present in the compactification are BPS objects. The slight difference is that supersymmetry constraints allow neither for a non-vanishing singlet component $G_3^{(0,3)}$ of the three-form flux nor for a non-vanishing non-primitive $(1,2)$ component of $G_3$, while equations of motion do. The non-primitive $(1,2)$ component of $G_3$ is always absent on a CY manifold, because there are not non-trivial five-forms. On the other hand the $G^{(0,3)}_3$ component can be used to break supersymmetry in a controllable way, as we explain below.\\

Finally, let us come back to the Einstein's equation and to the equation of motion for the dilaton. In the Einstein frame they read
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DilatonEinsteinEOM}
\tilde{R}_{ij} =&\, \frac{\left(4 \pi^2 \alpha'\right)^4}{4} e^{2 \phi} \partial_{[i} \tau \partial_{j]} + (2 \pi)^7 \left(T_{ij}^{\rm D7} - \frac{1}{8} \tilde{g}_{ij} T^{\rm D7}\right) \,, \nonumber \\
&\tilde{\nabla}^2 \tau = i e^\phi \left(\tilde{\nabla} \tau\right)^2 - 4 (2 \pi)^7 e^{-2 \phi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta S_{\rm D7}}{\delta \tau} \,,
\end{align}
where $T^{\rm D7}_{ij}$ is the stress tensor of D7-branes ($T^{\rm D7}$ is its trace) and $S_{\rm D7}$ is the D7-branes action. In the absence of the $G^{(0,3)}_3$ component of the three-form flux, and also in the absence of D7-branes in the compactification, the background solution is exactly the same as in warped compactifications of Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}. $G^{(0,3)}_3$ can be used to break supersymmetry from $\mathcal{N} = 1$ to $\mathcal{N} = 0$. However, from eq. \eqref{eq:DilatonEinsteinEOM} we immediately realize that, as soon as we introduce D7-branes into the compactification, the internal space is no longer a warped CY, since it is not Ricci-flat $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{ij} \neq 0$. In order for the constraints arising from the integrated equations of motion to be satisfied, the dilaton field has to acquire a dependence on the internal coordinates. This means that we are bound to consider F-theory solutions, lying in the class ($B_F$) of supersymmetric solutions of Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}. In the following we will work in a halfway case, since we will compute the spectrum of the EFT assuming that the internal space is a conformal CY, but at the same time we will introduce a limited number of D7-branes (which are usually needed for the consistency of the compactification, as we will see for example in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}), so that we can consider the right hand sides of eq.s \eqref{eq:DilatonEinsteinEOM} as small perturbations of the conformal CY background. At the same time, in order to get SUSY-breaking in a controllable way, also the $G^{(0,3)}_3$ component of the three-form flux has to be a small perturbation of the warped compactification.


\subsection{Moduli Space and Kaluza-Klein Reduction}
\label{ssec:ModuliSpace}

In order to get the four-dimensional spectrum of the compactification, it is necessary to perform a Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the ten-dimensional theory on a compact internal manifold $\chi$. This procedure typically gives rise to a tower of states, called \textit{Kaluza-Klein (KK) states} whose masses scale as\footnote{In this rough estimate we assume that the compactification manifold is isotropic.} $m_n \sim n M_s/R$, where $R$ is the radius of the compact space. $R$ can be rewritten in terms of the volume ${V}$ of the compact space as $R = \ell_s {V}^{1/6}$. As we have have observed in Sec.~\ref{sec:StringTheory} $M_s \sim M_{\rm P} {V}^{-1/2}$, so that the KK states masses are given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KKTower}
M_n \sim \frac{n M_{\rm P}}{{V}^{2/3}}\,.
\end{align}
Since massive KK states have not been observed in nature, we are interested in the EFT which is valid below the scale at which the massive KK states are excited 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KKScale}
E \ll M_{KK} \simeq \frac{M_{\rm P}}{{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{align}
namely we consider only massless KK fields, which correspond to harmonic forms of the compact internal space~\cite{Candelas:1990pi}. Eq. \eqref{eq:KKScale} is called \textit{KK approximation}. In order to trust the supergravity approximation we require ${V} \gg 1$, then there is a hierarchy between the string scale and the KK scale
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HierarchyMsMKK}
M_{KK} \ll M_s \ll M_{\rm P}\,.
\end{align}
The computation of the four-dimensional spectrum requires the knowledge of the moduli space of the compact manifold, and this is exactly the reason why it is necessary to restrict to the class of warped compactifications in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}. In the other cases the moduli space is poorly known. As we stressed in the last section, even in the conformal CY case the moduli space is not exactly the same as in CY manifolds, but assuming that the warping effects are small corrections we can safely use the mathematical tools of Sec.~\ref{ssec:CYCompactifications} to compute the spectrum.\\

The first step is to expand the ten-dimensional form-fields in the basis provided in Tab.~\ref{tab:BasisII}, and we get~\cite{grimm:2004uq}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ExpansionII}
B_2(x,y) &\,= B_2(x) + b^I(x) \omega_I\,, \quad C_0(x,y) = C_0(x) \,, \quad C_2(x,y) = C_2(x) + c^I(x) \omega_I \,, \nonumber \\
&C_4(x,y) = D^I_2(x) \wedge \omega_I + V^{\hat{A}}(x) \wedge \alpha_{\hat{A}} - Y_{\hat{A}}(x) \wedge \beta^{\hat{A}} + \psi_I(x) \tilde{\omega}^I\,,
\end{align}
where the fields on the left hand sides of the equations represent the ten-dimensional fields, which depend both on the four-dimensional coordinates $x$ and on the internal coordinates $y$. On the other hand, the coefficients of the expansions which depend only on the four-dimensional coordinates $x$, are four-dimensional fields. Along with the fields $t^I(x)$ and $U^A(x)$ in the expansions of eq.s \eqref{eq:KahlerModuli} and \eqref{eq:ComplexStructureDeformations}, the fields $B_2(x)$, $b^I(x)$, $C_0(x)$, $C_2(x)$, $c^I(x)$, $D^I_2(x)$, $V^{\hat{A}}(x)$, $Y_{\hat{A}}(x)$, $\psi_I(x)$ and the graviton $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ constitute the four-dimensional spectrum of the KK reduction\footnote{Due to the self-duality of the five-form $F_5$ it is necessary to eliminate half of the degrees of freedom in the expansion of $C_4(x,y)$. We choose to eliminate $D^I_2(x)$ and $Y_{\hat{A}}(x)$. We further discuss this point in Sec.~\ref{ssec:EFTfromIIB}.}. They can be organized in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supermultiplets as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 gravity multiplet: $(g_{\mu\nu}, V^0)$,
\item $h^{(2,1)}$ vector multiplets: $(V^A, U^A)$,
\item $h^{(1,1)}$ hypermultiplets: $(t^I, b^I, c^I, \psi_I)$,
\item 1 double-tensor multiplet: $(B_2, C_2, \phi, C_0)$.
\end{itemize}
The four-dimensional action can be obtained simply by inserting the expansion of the ten-dimensional field in the ten-dimensional supergravity action and then integrating over the internal compact space. The result is
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:N2effectiveaction}
S^{(4D)}_{\rm IIB} &= \int d^4 x\, \left[-\frac{1}{2} R *_4 1 + \frac{1}{4} \text{Re} \mathcal{M}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} F^{\hat{A}} \wedge F^{\hat{B}} + \frac{1}{4} \text{Im} \mathcal{M}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} F^{\hat{A}} \wedge *_4 F^{\hat{B}} -\right. \nonumber \\
&- G_{AB} dU^A \wedge *_4 d \overline{U}^B - G_{IJ} dt^I \wedge *_4 dt^J - \frac{1}{4} d \text{ln} \mathcal{K} \wedge *_4 d \text{ln} \mathcal{K} - \frac{1}{4} d\phi \wedge *_4 d\phi - \nonumber \\
&- \frac{1}{4} e^{2 \phi} d C_0 \wedge *_4 d C_0 - e^{-\phi} G_{IJ} db^I \wedge *_4 db^J - e^{\phi} G_{IJ} \left(dc^I - C_0 db^I\right) \wedge *_4 \left(dc^J - C_0 db^J\right) - \nonumber \\
&- \frac{9 G^{IL}}{4 \mathcal{K}} \left(d\psi_I - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_{IJK} \left(c^J db^K - b^J dc^K\right)\right) \wedge *_4 \left(d\psi_L - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_{LMN} \left(c^M db^N - b^M dc^N\right)\right) - \nonumber \\
&- \frac{\mathcal{K}^2}{144} e^{-\phi} dB_2 \wedge *_4 dB_2 - \frac{\mathcal{K}^2}{144} e^{\phi} \left(dC_2 - C_0 dB_2\right) \wedge *_4 \left(dC_2 - C_0 dB_2\right) + \nonumber \\
&\left. + \frac{1}{2} \left(db^I \wedge C_2 + c^I dB_2\right) \wedge \left(d\psi_I - \mathcal{K}_{IJK} c^J db^K\right) + \frac{1}{4} \mathcal{K}_{IJK} c^I c^J dB_2 \wedge db^K \right]\,,
\end{align}
\end{footnotesize}
where $F^{\hat{A}} = d V^{\hat{A}}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}}$ can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MKL}
\mathcal{M}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} = \overline{\mathcal{F}}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} + 2i \frac{\left(\text{Im} \mathcal{F}\right)_{\hat{A} \hat{C}} X^{\hat{C}} \left(\text{Im} \mathcal{F}\right)_{\hat{B} \hat{D}} X^{\hat{D}}}{X^{\hat{A}} \left(\text{Im} \mathcal{F}\right)_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} X^{\hat{B}}} \,,
\end{align}
and $X^{\hat{A}}$, $\mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}}$ are the periods of the holomorphic three-form $\Omega(U)$. $\mathcal{F}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}}$ is the period matrix defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Periods}
X^{\hat{A}} = \int_{\chi} \Omega \wedge \beta^{\hat{A}} \,, \quad \mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}} = \int_{\chi} \Omega \wedge \alpha_{\hat{A}} \,, \quad \mathcal{F}_{\hat{A} \hat{B}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}}}{\partial X^{\hat{B}}} \,,
\end{align}
so that in general the holomorphic three-form can be expanded as
\begin{align}
\Omega(U) = X^{\hat{A}}(U) \alpha_{\hat{A}} - \mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}}(U) \beta^{\hat{A}}\,.
\end{align}
Interestingly, $\mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}}$ can be seen as the derivative of a holomorphic prepotential $\mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial X^{\hat{A}}}$. As a consequence the metric $G_{AB}$ on the space of complex structure deformations
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MetricComplexStructure}
G_{AB} = \frac{\partial}{\partial U^A} \frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{U}^B} K_{\rm cs}\,,
\end{align}
is completely determined by the holomorphic prepotential $\mathcal{F}$ and the space of complex structure deformations is a special \Kahler manifold. In fact $K_{\rm cs}$ is the \Kahler po-\\	tential of the space of complex deformations, and
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerPotentialComplexDeformations}
K_{\rm cs} = - \text{ln} \left[-i \int_{\chi} \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}\right] = - \text{ln} \left[i \left(\overline{X}^{\hat{A}} \mathcal{F}_{\hat{A}} - X^{\hat{A}} \overline{\mathcal{F}}_{\hat{A}}\right)\right] \,,
\end{align}

On the other hand, $G_{IJ}$ is the metric on the space of \Kahler deformations, and it takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MetricKahlerModuli}
G_{IJ} = \frac{3}{2 \mathcal{K}} \int_{\chi} \omega_I \wedge *_6 \omega_J = -\frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{\mathcal{K}_{IJ}}{\mathcal{K}} - \frac{3}{2} \frac{\mathcal{K}_I \mathcal{K}_J}{\mathcal{K}^2}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where we have defined
\begin{align}
\label{eq:IntersectionNumbers}
&\mathcal{K}_{IJK} = \int_{\chi} \omega_I \wedge \omega_J \wedge \omega_K \,, \qquad \mathcal{K}_{IJ} = \int_{\chi} \omega_I \wedge \omega_J \wedge J \,,& \nonumber \\
&\mathcal{K}_I = \int_{\chi} \omega_I \wedge J \wedge J \,, \qquad \mathcal{K} = \int_{\chi} J \wedge J \wedge J = \mathcal{K}_{IJK} v^I v^J v^K \,.&
\end{align}
Let us notice that with these conventions the volume ${V}$ of the compact space (measured in units of string length $\ell_s = 2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}$) is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VolumeFormal}
{V} = \frac{\mathcal{K}}{6} \,,
\end{align}
As expected, the bare compactification of the ten-dimensional supergravity on a CY space gives us a $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric theory in four dimensions. In the next section we will review how to reduce it to $\mathcal{N} = 1$ theory.

\subsection{$\mathcal{N} = 1$ EFT from Type IIB Orientifolds}
\label{ssec:EFTfromIIB}

In Sec.~\ref{ssec:SUSYConditions} we have observed that a broad set of flux configurations is compatible with a $\mathcal{N} = 1$ four-dimensional supersymmetric EFT, and as we already stressed, we restricted to the class warped compactifications in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua} because in the limit of large volume for the compact space, it is known how to safely perform the KK reduction. Furthermore, in Sec.~\ref{ssec:EqOfMotion} we have noticed that, in order to satisfy the constraints coming from the integrated equations of motion, the compactification must include negative tension sources for the D3-brane charge density, namely O3-planes. Very interestingly, these two observations nicely fit together. In fact, as we mentioned at the end of Sec.~\ref{ssec:SUSYConditions} the introduction of O3/O7-planes is compatible with warped compactifications, so that on the one hand they leave us with a $\mathcal{N} = 1$ low-energy theory, and on the other hand it is possible to keep trusting the EFT. From a practical point of view, the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ spectrum is obtained by truncating the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ spectrum of the previous section, projecting out the state which are not invariant under an involution introduced by the presence of the O-planes. In the present section we briefly review this procedure following~\cite{Grana:2003ek}.\\

As a first step we require that $\chi$ is symmetric under an action $\sigma$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item it leaves invariant the four-dimensional non-compact space-time,
\item it is involutive $\sigma^2 = 1$,
\item it is isometric: $\sigma g = g$,
\item it is holomorphic: $\sigma {J_m}^n = {J_m}^n$,
\item it acts on the holomorphic three-form as $\sigma^* \Omega = - \Omega$,
\end{enumerate}
where ${J_m}^n = J_{m \overline{p}} g^{\overline{p} n}$ is the complex structure, and $\sigma^*$ is the pull-back of $\sigma$. $\sigma$ can be interpreted as a reflection with respect to a fixed plane, which is the O-plane. Since it leaves the four-dimensional space-time invariant, O-planes have to span the non-compact directions. Let us notice that the requirement of holomorphicity in principle allows all even-dimensional O-planes, but in order to lie in the class of warped compactifications, we additionally require condition 5., which leaves out O5/O9-planes. In fact, in complex coordinates $z^k$, we can write $\Omega \propto dz^1 \wedge dz^2 \wedge dz^3$. Because of condition 5., we have two possibilities: either one single complex coordinates gets reversed under $\sigma$, or all the complex internal coordinates get reversed under $\sigma$. The first possibility implies that the O-plane spans 8 dimensions (namely it is a O7-plane), while the second possibility means that the O-plane spans 4 dimension (namely it is a O3-plane). Hence $\sigma$ is compatible with supersymmetry in presence of O3/O7 planes.\\

The spectrum of the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theory can be consistently truncated by the action of the operator
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldInvolution}
\mathcal{O}_{\rm O3/O7} = \left(-1\right)^{F_L} \Omega_p \sigma\,,
\end{align}
where $\Omega_p$ is the usual world-sheet parity, while $F_L$ is the space-time fermion number in the left moving sector.  We summarize the parity of the Type IIB ten-dimensional bosonic fields under the action of $\Omega_p$ and $\left(-1\right)^{F_L}$ in Tab.~\ref{tab:ParityOrientifold}.
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & $\phi$ & $g$ & $B_2$ & $C_0$ & $C_2$ & $C_4$\\
\hline
$\left(-1\right)^{F_L}$ & $+$ & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ \\
\hline
$\Omega_p$ & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ \\

\caption{\label{tab:ParityOrientifold} 
Parity of the Type IIB ten-dimensional bosonic fields under the action of $\Omega_p$ and $\left(-1\right)^{F_L}$.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Since $\sigma$ is an involution, then the cohomology groups of the CY manifold splits into two eigenspaces under the action of $\sigma^*$, corresponding to the eigenvalues $\pm 1$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SplitCohomologyGroups}
H^{(p,q)} = H^{(p,q)}_+ \oplus H^{(p,q)}_- \,.
\end{align}
In Tab.~\ref{tab:SplitCohomologyGroups} we report the dimensions of the cohomology groups, and also the splitting of the relative basis, which plays a crucial role in the truncation of the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ spectrum.\\
\begin{small}

\end{tabular} 
\caption{\label{tab:SplitCohomologyGroups} Splitting of the cohomology groups under the action of $\sigma^*$, with relative dimensions and basis.}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{small}

All the split indexes run from 1 to the dimension of the relative eigenspace of the cohomology group. Again, $(\alpha_\alpha, \beta^{\beta})$ and $(\alpha_{\hat{\alpha}}, \beta^{\hat{\beta}})$ form symplectic basis for the corresponding cohomology groups, namely the only non-vanishing intersections are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedSymplecticBasis}
\int_\chi \alpha_\alpha \wedge \beta^\beta = \delta_\alpha^\beta \,, \quad \int_\chi \alpha_{\hat{a}} \wedge \beta^{\hat{b}} = \delta_{\hat{a}}^{\hat{b}}\,.
\end{align}

It is easy now to infer the orientifolded spectrum of the four-dimensional EFT.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\phi(x,y)$ and $C_0(x,y)$ are invariant under $\mathcal{O}_{\rm O3/O7}$ and then the four-dimensional fields $\phi(x)$ and $C_0(x)$ remain in the spectrum.
\item Since $B_2(x,y)$ are odd under the combined action of $\left(-1\right)^{F_L} \Omega_p$, only the odd components under the action of $\sigma^*$ remain in the spectrum. Their expansions look like
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedB2C2}
B_2(x,y) = b^i(x) \omega_i\,, \qquad C_2(x,y) = c^i(x) \omega_i \,.
\end{align}
\item $C_4(x,y)$ is even under the combined action of $\left(-1\right)^{F_L} \Omega_p$, then only the even components under $\sigma^*$ remain in the spectrum. Its expansion looks like
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedC4}
C_4(x,y) = D_2^i(x) \wedge \omega_i + V^\alpha(x) \wedge \alpha_\alpha + Y_\alpha(x) \wedge \beta^\alpha + \psi_i(x) \tilde{\omega}^i \,.
\end{align}
\item Since the action of $\sigma^*$ is holomorphic, then only the even components under $\sigma^*$ of the \Kahler form $J$ remain in the spectrum
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedJ}
J = t^i(x) \omega_i \,.
\end{align}
\item Given that the action of $\sigma$ leaves the metric invariant, while $\Omega$ is odd under the action of $\sigma^*$, then only the odd components of the complex structure moduli remain in the spectrum, and the expansion of the metric perturbation in eq. \eqref{eq:ComplexStructureDeformations} takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedComplexStructure}
h_{ij} = \sum_{a = 1}^{h_-^{(2,1)}} \frac{i}{||\Omega||^2} \overline{U}^a(x) \left(\overline{\chi}_a\right)_{i \overline{i} \overline{j}} {\Omega^{\overline{i} \overline{j}}}_j \,.
\end{align}
\end{itemize}

The surviving fields constitute a $\mathcal{N} = 1$ EFT, and they assemble into the multiplets reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:OrientifoldedMultiplets}\\
\begin{table}

A few observations are in order at this point. First, notice that the four-dimensional forms $B_2(x)$ and $C_2(x)$ are projected out of the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ spectrum. Furthermore, the non-vanishing of the scalar fields $c^\iota$ and $b^\iota$ are related to the presence of O7-planes. In fact, since O-planes are fixed loci under the orientifold involution, in presence of only O3-planes all the tangent vectors are odd under the action of $\sigma$. As a consequence the expansions in eq. \eqref{eq:OrientifoldedB2C2} are not admitted. On the contrary, if also O7-planes are present in the compactification, then it is possible to get harmonic forms with the correct transformation behavior so that the expansions in eq. \eqref{eq:OrientifoldedB2C2} are admitted, and the scalar fields $c^\iota$ and $b^\iota$ remain in the spectrum.\\

The four-dimensional effective action can be computed by performing again a KK reduction of the orientifolded spectrum. Since it is just a long but straightforward operation, we mention only a couple of key points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Once we take into account the orientifold projection, the metric on the complex structure deformations space becomes
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedComplexStructureMetric}
G_{ab} = \frac{\partial}{\partial U^a} \frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{U}^b} K_{\rm cs} \,, \quad K_{\rm cs} = - \text{ln} \left[i\left(\overline{X}^{\hat{a}} \mathcal{F}_{\hat{a}} - X^{\hat{a}} \overline{\mathcal{F}}_{\hat{a}}\right)\right] \,,
\end{align}
\item Due to the orientifold the following intersection numbers vanish
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VanishingIntersectionNumbersOrientifold}
\mathcal{K}_{ij \lambda} = \mathcal{K}_{\iota \kappa \lambda} = \mathcal{K}_{i \kappa} = \mathcal{K}_{\iota} = 0\,,
\end{align}
and then the metric on the \Kahler deformations space takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:OrientifoldedKahlerMetric}
G_{ij} = -\frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{\mathcal{K}_{ij}}{\mathcal{K}} - \frac{3}{2} \frac{\mathcal{K}_i \mathcal{K}_j}{\mathcal{K}^2}\right) \,, \quad G_{\iota \kappa} = -\frac{3}{2} \frac{\mathcal{K}_{\iota \kappa}}{\mathcal{K}} \,, \quad G_{i \kappa} = G_{\iota j} = 0 \,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NonVanishingOrientifoldedIntersectionNumbers}
\mathcal{K}_{ij} = \mathcal{K}_{ijk} t^k \,, \quad \mathcal{K}_{\iota \kappa} = \mathcal{K}_{\iota \kappa l} t^l\,, \quad \mathcal{K}_{i} = \mathcal{K}_{ijk} t^j t^k \,, \quad \mathcal{K} = \mathcal{K}_{ijk} t^i t^j t^k \,.
\end{align}
\item The self-duality condition of $F_5$ can be imposed by adding to the four-dimensional action the following total derivative
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TotalDerivative}
\delta S^{(4)} = \frac{1}{4} dV^\alpha \wedge dY_\alpha + \frac{1}{4} dD_2^i \wedge d\psi_i\,.
\end{align}
the equations of motion for $D_2^i$ and $Y_\alpha$ (or equivalently for $\psi_i$ and $V^\alpha$) coincide with the self-duality condition and then it is possible to eliminate $D_2^i$ and $Y_\alpha$ (or $\psi_i$ and $V^\alpha$) by inserting their equations of motion into the action. The choice of eliminating the former or the latter corresponds to the choice of expressing the four-dimensional action in terms of linear or chiral multiplets respectively. Since we want to express the four-dimensional action in terms of chiral multiplets, we choose to eliminate $D^i_2$ and $Y_\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
We report the four-dimensional action expressed in terms of chiral multiplets:
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FourDimensionalOrientifoldedAction}
S^{(4)} &= \int d^4x\, \left[-\frac{1}{2} R *_4 1 - G_{ab} dU^a \wedge *_4 d\overline{U}^b - G_{ij} dt^i \wedge *_4 dt^j - \frac{1}{4} d \text{ln} \mathcal{K} \wedge *_4 d \text{ln} \mathcal{K} - \right.& \nonumber \\
&- \frac{1}{4} d \phi \wedge *_4 d \phi - \frac{1}{4} e^{2 \phi} d C_0 \wedge *_4 dC_0 - e^{-\phi} G_{\iota \kappa} db^\iota \wedge *_4 d b^\kappa -& \nonumber \\
&- e^{\phi} G_{\iota \kappa} (dc^\iota - C_0 db^\iota) \wedge *_4 (dc^\kappa - C_0 db^\kappa) -& \nonumber \\
&- \frac{9 G^{ij}}{4 \mathcal{K}^2} \left(d \psi_i - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_{i \iota \kappa} (c^\iota db^\kappa - b^\iota dc^\kappa )\right) \wedge *_4 \left(d \psi_j - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_{j \iota \kappa} (c^\iota db^\kappa - b^\iota dc^\kappa)\right) +& \nonumber \\
&\left.+ \frac{1}{4} \text{Im} \mathcal{M}_{\alpha \beta} F^\alpha \wedge *_4 F^\beta + \frac{1}{4} \mathcal{M}_{\alpha \beta} F^\alpha \wedge F^\beta - V *_4 1 \right] \,,&
\end{align}
\end{small}
where $F^\alpha = dV^\alpha$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha \beta}$ is the same as in eq. \eqref{eq:MKL} but evaluated in $U^\alpha = \overline{U}^\beta = 0$ to take into account the orientifold projection. The scalar potential turns out to be semi-definite positive, and it takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ScalarPotentialOrientifolded}
V = \frac{18i e^\phi}{\mathcal{K}^2 \int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}} \left(\int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{G}_3\int_\chi \overline{\Omega} \wedge G_3 + G^{ab} \int_\chi \chi_a \wedge G_3 \int_\chi \overline{\chi}_b \wedge \overline{G}_3\right) \,.
\end{align}

The next step is to bring the four-dimensional action in eq. \eqref{eq:FourDimensionalOrientifoldedAction} in the standard $\mathcal{N} = 1$, which boils down the the choice of the proper coordinates on the moduli space such that it can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:StandardAction}
S^{(4)} =& - \int d^4x \, \left[\frac{1}{2} R *_4 1 + K_{I \overline{J}} DM^I \wedge *_4 D\overline{M}^{\overline{J}} +\right. \nonumber \\
&\left. + \frac{1}{2} \text{Re} f_{\alpha \beta} F^{\kappa} \wedge *_4 F^{\lambda} + \frac{1}{2} \text{Im} f_{\alpha \beta} F^{\kappa} \wedge F^{\lambda} + V *_4 1 \right] \,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ScalarPotential}
V = e^K \left(K^{I \overline{J}} D_I W D_{\overline{J}} \overline{W} - 3 |W|^2\right) + \frac{1}{2} \left(\text{Re} f\right)^{-1 \, \alpha \beta} D_\alpha D_{\beta} \,.
\end{align}
In eq.s \eqref{eq:StandardAction} and \eqref{eq:ScalarPotential} $M^I$ denotes collectively all complex scalars of the theory and $K_{I \overline{J}}$ is a \Kahler metric which satisfies $K_{I \overline{J}} = \partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} K(M, \overline{M})$, where $K$ is the \Kahler potential of the theory. The \Kahler covariant derivative takes the form $D_I W = \partial_I W + (\partial_I K) W$.\\

It is necessary to find a complex structure on the moduli space such that the metric of the action in eq. \eqref{eq:FourDimensionalOrientifoldedAction} is manifestly \Kahler. It turns out that the coordinates $U^a$ on the space of the complex structure deformations are already proper \Kahler coordinates and $G_{ab}$ is the corresponding \Kahler metric. On the contrary, the remaining fields need a non-trivial redefinition~\cite{Grana:2003ek, Becker:2002nn}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FieldRedefinition}
\tau = C_0 + i e^{-\phi} \,, \qquad G^\iota = c^\iota - \tau b^\iota \,, \nonumber \\
T_i = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_i(t^i) - \zeta_i(\tau, \overline{\tau}, G, \overline{G}) + i \psi_i\,,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{K}_i$ is defined in eq. \eqref{eq:NonVanishingOrientifoldedIntersectionNumbers}, while
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Zeta}
\zeta_i = - \frac{i}{2 (\tau - \overline{\tau})} \mathcal{K}_{i \kappa \lambda} G^\kappa (G - \overline{G})^{\lambda}\,.
\end{align}

$\psi_i$ are axionic fields. Since they correspond to the integral of $C_4$ over the four-cycles of the compact manifold, the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ EFT inherits a perturbative \textit{shift-symmetry} under the transformations
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ShiftSymmetry}
\psi_i \rightarrow \psi_i + \tilde{\psi}_i \,, \qquad \tilde{\psi}_i = \text{const.}\,,
\end{align}
from the gauge symmetry in eq. \eqref{eq:GaugeTransformations} of the ten-dimensional theory. Also the field $C_0$ is an axion. It inherits the same shift-symmetry as the fields $\psi_i$ as a consequence of the gauge symmetry of the ten-dimensional $C_0(x,y)$ field. As a consequence $\psi_i$ and $C_0$ do not enter the expression for the tree-level \Kahler potential $K_0$, which in terms of the coordinates in eq. \eqref{eq:FieldRedefinition} can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerPotential}
K_0 = - 2 \text{ln} {V} - \text{ln} \left(-i \left(\tau - \overline{\tau}\right)\right) - \text{ln} \left(-i \int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega} \right)\,,
\end{align}
where in order to emphasize the physical meaning of $\mathcal{K}$, which is essentially the volume of the compact space, we redefined
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VolumeStandardForm}
{V} \equiv \frac{\mathcal{K}\left(t^i(T_i + \overline{T}_i, \tau - \overline{\tau}, G^\kappa - \overline{G}^\kappa)\right)}{6} \,,
\end{align}
where ${V}$ is the volume of the CY space measured in the Einstein frame and in string units $\ell_s = 2 \pi \sqrt{\alpha'}$. Even if it is not always possible to invert eq. \eqref{eq:FieldRedefinition} in order to get $t^i(\tau, T, G)$, in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotential} we should regard ${V}$ as a function of $(\tau - \overline{\tau}, T_i + \overline{T}_i, G^{\kappa} - \overline{G}^\kappa)$, where these combinations of the fields $\tau, T_i, G^{\kappa}$ are due to the shift-symmetry of axions of eq. \eqref{eq:ShiftSymmetry}.\\

In the simplest case with $h_+^{(1,1)} = 1$, so that one single \Kahler field $T$ parametrizes the volume of the compact space, eq. \eqref{eq:FieldRedefinition} can be solved explicitly for $t$ and the final result is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerPotentialSingleField}
-2 \text{ln} \mathcal{K} = -3 \text{ln} \left[T + \overline{T} - \frac{i}{2(\tau - \overline{\tau})} \mathcal{K}_{1 \kappa \lambda} (G - \overline{G})^\kappa (G - \overline{G})^\lambda\right]\,.
\end{align}

An interesting point is that the moduli space takes the diagonal form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ModuliSpace}
\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_{\text{cs}}^{h_-^{(1,2)}} \times \mathcal{M}_{\text{k}}^{h_-^{(1,1)} + 1}\,,
\end{align}
where each component is a \Kahler manifold. In~\cite{Martucci:2014ska} the author computed the \Kahler potential without neglecting warping effects and he showed that they deform the \Kahler component of the moduli space. In the present thesis we do not consider this possibility. As we will observe in Sec.~\ref{ssec:VisibleSector}, the introduction of the visible sector supported on D3-branes at singularities spoils the product structure of the moduli space at sub-leading order in the volume expansion. In the simplified case with $G^{\iota} = 0$ the tree-level moduli space undergoes a further split, since the first term depends only on the \Kahler moduli, while the second term depends only on the axio-dilaton. Such splitting is however broken as soon as quantum corrections to the tree-level \Kahler potential in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotential} are considered.\\

The tree-level \Kahler potential $K_0$ in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotential} obeys the \textit{no-scale structure} condition, which takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NoScaleStructure}
K_0^{I \overline{J}} \frac{\partial K_0}{\partial M^I} \frac{\partial K_0}{\partial \overline{M}_{\overline{J}}} = 3\,,
\end{align}
where the sum runs over the moduli $(T_i, G^{\kappa})$. Eq. \eqref{eq:NoScaleStructure} implies that the scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotential} is positive semi-definite.\\

The gauge kinetic functions can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GaugeKineticFunctions}
f_{\alpha \beta} = -\frac{i}{2} \left.\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{\alpha \beta}\right|_{U^\alpha = \overline{U}^\alpha = 0} \,,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha \beta}$ is reported in eq. \eqref{eq:MKL}. It turns out that $f_{\alpha \beta}$ are holomorphic in $U^a$, as it should be. Finally the scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotentialOrientifolded} can be inferred from a tree-level superpotential of the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TreeLevelSuperpotential}
W_0 (\tau, U^a) = \int_\chi \Omega \wedge G_3 \,,
\end{align}
which is called Gukov-Vafa-Witten (GVW) superpotential~\cite{Gukov:1999ya}. As we will see in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:ModelBuilding}, the generation of this superpotential, which can be traced back to the presence of fluxes, gives mass to some of the moduli of the compactification. Notice that \Kahler moduli do not appear in $W_0$, as a consequence of its holomorphicity and of the shift-symmetry in eq. \eqref{eq:ShiftSymmetry} of axion fields.

\section{Model Building}
\label{sec:ModelBuilding}

The aim of the present section is to show how to build a semi-realistic model of particle physics starting from the EFT built in Sec.~\ref{ssec:EFTfromIIB}. There are two main issues in doing model building following the bottom-up approach~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Global issues: as we already mentioned, moduli are massless scalar fields which are unwelcome from a phenomenological point of view, since on the one hand they would mediate a fifth force which is not observed in nature, and on the other hand all the parameters of the action in eq. \eqref{eq:StandardAction} depend on their VEVs, so that without fixing them it is not possible to get predictions from string theory. The procedure used to fix the moduli is called \textit{moduli stabilization} and it is the main subject of Sec.~\ref{ssec:ModuliStabilization}.
 \item Local issues: as we argued, in the bottom-up approach to string phenomenology, the visible sector is localized on stacks of D-branes wrapping some cycles in the compact space. It is anyway necessary to look for a D-branes configuration which reproduces the desired extension of the SM. This is the main subject of Sec.~\ref{ssec:VisibleSector}.
\end{itemize}

Given that the visible sector is localized in a small region of the compact space, a nice feature of these models is that they allow to get some degree of decoupling between global and local issues, depending on the details of the model. However in the end, in order to embed the local D-branes configuration within a global construction, it is necessary to perform all the consistency checks which are required to ensure that the compactification is well-defined. We will report an explicit example in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}.


\subsection{Moduli Stabilization}
\label{ssec:ModuliStabilization}

The present section is organized as follows: in the first part we show how to stabilize many moduli by simply using the presence of fluxes in the compactification. \Kahler moduli remain unfixed, and in order to stabilize them it is necessary to introduce quantum corrections to the tree-level scalar potential as we show in the second part of the section. Finally, we analyze the moduli stabilization procedure which is extensively used in the present thesis: the \textit{Large Volume Scenario}.

\subsubsection{Tree-level Moduli Stabilization by Fluxes}
\label{sssec:TreeLevelModuliStabilization}

The first step consists in the analysis of the effects of fluxes on the spectrum of the EFT~\cite{Giddings:2001yu, Kachru:2003aw, Lust:2005bd, Antoniadis:2005nu, Gomis:2005wc, GarciadelMoral:2005js, Camara:2004jj}.\\

As we have seen in Sec.~\ref{ssec:EFTfromIIB} the presence of fluxes generates a tree-level superpotential $W_0$ which depends on complex structure moduli $U^a$ and on the dilaton $S$\footnote{Henceforth we use a slightly different notation for the axio-dilaton field: $S = -i \tau = e^{- \phi} - i C_0$.}, as in eq. \eqref{eq:TreeLevelSuperpotential}. The dependence on the complex structure moduli is encoded in $\Omega$, while the dependence on the axio-dilaton field is explicit in the definition of $G_3$. $W_0$ generates a scalar potential for the complex structure moduli and the dilaton. We analyze the scalar potential in an inverse volume expansion, since in order to trust the supergravity approximation ${V} \gg 1$. The tree-level expression in eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotentialOrientifolded} can be rewritten in a more compact form as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ScalarPotentialNoScale}
V_{\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)} = e^{K} \left(\left|D_S W_0\right|^2 + \left|D_{U} W_0\right|^2\right)\,,
\end{align}
where the first term in the bracket corresponds to the first term in the bracket of eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotentialOrientifolded}, while the second term corresponds to the second term in eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotentialOrientifolded}. The sum over the \Kahler moduli does not appear due to the no-scale structure of eq. \eqref{eq:NoScaleStructure}, which makes the \Kahler moduli-dependent terms in the bracket vanish. The only \Kahler moduli dependence lies into the pre-factor $e^K \sim {V}^{-2}$, which induces a run-away in the \Kahler directions, as it can be easily understood in the simplest example of a single \Kahler modulus $T$, which implies ${V} = \left(T + \overline{T}\right)^{3/2}$. This pre-factor also fixes the order of $V_{\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)}$ in the volume expansion. The only allowed global minimum is then at $V_{\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)} = 0$, namely at
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GlobalMinimum}
D_S W_0 = \int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{G}_3 = 0\,, \qquad D_{U^a} W_0 = i \int_{\chi} \chi_a \wedge G_3 = 0\,.
\end{align}
These two conditions correspond to having a ISD $G_3$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SupersymmetricMinimum}
\left\{\begin{matrix} D_S W_0 = 0 \\ D_{U^a} W_0 = 0 \end{matrix}\right. \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left\{\begin{matrix} G_{3}^{(0,3)} = 0 \\ G_{3}^{(1,2)} = 0 \end{matrix}\right. \quad \Rightarrow \quad *_6 G_3 = i G_3\,.
\end{align}
Given that F-terms govern the breaking of supersymmetry, and they are defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FTermsDefinition}
F^i = e^{K/2} K^{i \overline{j}} D_{\overline{j}} \overline{W} \,,
\end{align}
the minimum in eq. \eqref{eq:GlobalMinimum} is clearly supersymmetric if the additional requirement is satisfied:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Vanishing03Component}
D_{T_i} W_0 = D_{G^\kappa} W_0 \propto W_0 = 0 \,,
\end{align}
which translates into $G_3^{(0,3)} = 0$, since $W_0 = \int_\chi G_3 \wedge \Omega_3$. As expected, the ISD condition supplemented with $G_3^{(0,3)} = 0$ corresponds exactly to the class of warped compactifications in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}.\\

The masses of complex structure moduli and of the axio-dilaton field are determined by the flux energy density, which is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FluxesMasses}
m_{U^a} \sim m_S \simeq \int_{\Sigma_3} F_3 \simeq \int_{\Sigma_3} H_3 \sim \frac{\alpha'}{R^3} = \frac{M_{\rm P}}{{V}} \,,
\end{align}
where $\Sigma_3$ denotes a generic a three-cycle inside $\chi$.\\

Eq. \eqref{eq:SupersymmetricMinimum} implies the existence of a landscape of vacua, since it gives rise to $2 h^{(1,2)} + 2$ real equations, which have hundreds or thousands of solutions for $(S,U)$\footnote{In the sensible range of parameters, namely for $s \gg 1$, since it fixes the string coupling constant to small values, as required in the perturbative approach.}, once the parameter space given by $(m^{\hat{a}}, e_{\hat{a}}, m_{\rm RR}^{\hat{a}}, e_{\text{RR}\, \hat{a}}) \in \mathbb{Z}^4$ is scanned.\\

We can conclude that the presence of fluxes allows for the stabilization of complex structure moduli $U^a$ and the axio-dilaton $S$ at supersymmetric global minima, for which eq.s \eqref{eq:SupersymmetricMinimum}, \eqref{eq:Vanishing03Component} hold. This is an intuitive result, since for a given set of fluxes $(m^{\hat{a}}, e_{\hat{a}}, m_{\rm RR}^{\hat{a}}, e_{\text{RR}\, \hat{a}}) \in \mathbb{Z}^4$ there exist only a limited number of complex structures and values of the axio-dilaton field which constrain $G_3$ to have only $(2,1)$ non-vanishing component. On the other hand, it is also intuitive that the presence of fluxes does not stabilize \Kahler moduli, since the ISD condition in eq. \eqref{eq:ISD} is invariant under a rescaling of the internal metric contained into $*_6$, and then a rescaling of the size of the internal cycles is allowed.

\subsubsection{Corrections beyond Tree Level}
\label{sssec:CorrectionsToTreeLevel}

The presence of fluxes allows to stabilize complex structure moduli and the axio-dilaton, but it leaves the \Kahler directions flat as a consequence of the no-scale structure of eq. \eqref{eq:NoScaleStructure}. Nevertheless, there exist various corrections which break the no-scale structure and then produce a non-vanishing potential for the \Kahler moduli. In particular, due to the non-renormalization theorem which protects the superpotential from perturbative corrections~\cite{dine:1986vd, Burgess:2005jx, Becker:2006ks}, we can write schematically
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SchematicRenormalization}
W = W_0 + W_{\rm np}\,, \qquad K = K_0 + K_{\rm p} + K_{\rm np} \,,
\end{align}
where the subscript np stands for ``non-perturbative'', while the subscript p stands for ``perturbative''. $W_0$ and $K_0$ are the tree-level expressions, respectively given in eq. \eqref{eq:TreeLevelSuperpotential} and eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotential}.\\

As we have mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:StringTheory}, string theory naturally contains two different dimensionless expansion parameters: the string coupling constant $g_s$ and the string-over-internal-size $\frac{\alpha'}{R^2}$. The first one governs the strength of string interactions, while the second one governs the effects due to the one-dimensional nature of strings. In the perturbative approach which we are using, both of them have to be small. As a consequence two different perturbative expansions are allowed in the EFT descending from string compactifications. Non-perturbative corrections instead are due to either D3-brane instantons or gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes. At the moment they are well understood only from a four-dimensional point of view.\\

The corrections we are going to introduce break both four-dimensional supersymmetry and the no-scale structure, in order to generate a non-vanishing scalar potential for the \Kahler moduli. From a ten-dimensional perspective this amounts to allow for non-vanishing components $G_{3}^{(3,0)}$, $G_3^{(1,2)}$, $G_3^{(0,3)}$ of the three-form flux. As we will observe in Sec.~\ref{sssec:LVS}, such corrections produce a sub-leading effect in the effective field theory, since the scalar potential for \Kahler moduli is generated at order $\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$, while the supersymmetric stabilization due to fluxes takes place at order $\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)$. Consequently, in the large volume regime ${V} \gg 1$ these corrections can be considered as small perturbations around the supersymmetric background of warped compactifications, so that the EFT is still trustable.

\paragraph{$\mathbf{\alpha'}$-corrections - } The tree-level ten-dimensional action of Type IIB supergravity in eq. \eqref{eq:EffectiveAction} receives corrections from higher derivatives operators. Schematically they can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CorrectedEffectiveAction}
S_{\rm IIB} = &\, S_{0,\rm tree} + \left(\alpha'\right)^3 S_{0, (3)} + \dots + \left(\alpha'\right)^n S_{0, (n)} + S_{\text{CS}, \rm tree} + \nonumber \\
&+ S_{\rm loc, tree} + \left(\alpha'\right)^2 S_{\text{loc}, (2)} + \dots + \left(\alpha'\right)^n S_{\text{loc}, (n)} \,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EffectiveActionRRNSNS}
S_{0, \rm tree} = \frac{1}{2 \kappa_{10}^2} \int d^{10}x\,\sqrt{-g} \left[\La_{\rm NSNS} + \La_{\rm RR}\right]\,,
\end{align}
as defined in eq. \eqref{eq:EffectiveAction}, while $S_{\text{CS}, \rm tree} = \frac{1}{2 \kappa_{10}^2} \int d^{10}x\,\sqrt{-g} \La_{\rm CS}$. Each subscript within brackets $(i)$ denotes the $i$-th order correction in the $\alpha'$-expansion. $\alpha'$-corrections to the local action give a non-vanishing potential for D7-branes, but not for D3-branes. In particular it turns out that the $\left(\alpha'\right)^2 S_{\text{loc}, (2)}$ correction produces an effective D3-branes charge for D7-branes~\cite{Giddings:2001yu}. We focus on the leading $\alpha'$-correction $\left(\alpha'\right)^3 S_{0, (3)}$. Supersymmetry and invariance under worldsheet parity constrain $S_{0, (3)}$ to take the schematic form~\cite{Conlon:2005ki}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LeadingAlphaAction}
\left(\alpha'\right)^3 S_{0, (3)} \sim&\, \frac{1}{2 \kappa_{10}^2} \int d^{10}x\,\sqrt{-g} \left[\mathcal{R}^4 + \mathcal{R}^3 \left(G_3 G_3 + G_3 \overline{G}_3 + \overline{G}_3 \overline{G}_3 + F_5^2 + \left(\nabla \tau\right)^2\right) + \right. \nonumber \\
&+ \mathcal{R}^2 \left(G_3^4 + G_3^2 \overline{G}_3^2 + \dots + \left(\nabla G_3\right)^2 + \left(\nabla F_5\right)^2 + \dots\right) + \nonumber \\
&\left. + \mathcal{R} \left(G_3^6 + \dots + G_3^2 \left(\nabla G_3\right)^2 + \dots\right) + G_3^8 + \dots \right] \,,
\end{align}
where the precise tensorial structure is fully known only for a few contributions~\cite{Kehagias:1997cq, Policastro:2006vt, Liu:2013dna}. For example, the tensorial structure of the $\mathcal{R}^4$ term is completely understood~\cite{Becker:2002nn, Antoniadis:1997eg}. It can be written as the combination
\begin{align}
\label{eq:AlphaPrimeTensorStructure}
J_0 = t_8 t_8 \mathcal{R}^4 - \frac{1}{8} \epsilon_{10} \epsilon_{10} \mathcal{R}^4 \,,
\end{align}
where the tensor $t_8$ is defined in~\cite{Green:1987sp, Tseytlin:1995bi, Minasian:2015bxa}\footnote{For the explicit definition of $t_8$ in terms of the metric see for example Appendix A of~\cite{Minasian:2015bxa}}, while $\epsilon_{10}$ is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 10 dimensions. The correction in eq. \eqref{eq:AlphaPrimeTensorStructure} gives rise to a correction of the \Kahler potential of the form~\cite{Becker:2002nn}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AlphaPrimeKahlerPotential}
K \supset - 2 \log \left({V} + \frac{\xi \left(S + \overline{S}\right)^{3/2}}{2}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:XiHat}
\xi = - \frac{\left(\alpha'\right)^3 \zeta(3) \chi(\chi)}{2^{5/2} (2 \pi)^3} \,,
\end{align}
and $\zeta(3) \simeq 1.202$ is the Riemann zeta function computed in $3$, while $\chi(\chi)$ is the Euler characteristic of the CY manifold $\chi$ considered, which can be written in terms of the Hodge numbers as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:EulerCY}
\chi(\chi) = 2 \left(h^{(1,1)} - h^{(1,2)}\right) \,.
\end{align}
In~\cite{Ciupke:2015msa} further $\alpha'$-corrections at the same order $\left(\alpha'\right)^3$ have been computed. We report on them in Sec.~\ref{sssec:HigherDerivativeAlphaCorrections}. Furthermore, in~\cite{Minasian:2015bxa} the authors showed that the orientifold planes present in the compactification can affect $(\alpha')^3$-correction in eq. \eqref{eq:AlphaPrimeKahlerPotential} by shifting the Euler characteristic in eq. \eqref{eq:XiHat} in the following way
\begin{align}
\chi(\chi) \quad \longrightarrow \qquad \chi(\chi) + 2 \int_{\chi} D_{\rm O7}^3 \,,
\end{align}
where $D_{\rm O7}$ is the class Poincar\'e dual to the divisor wrapped by the O7-plane. This correction does not introduce qualitative changes in the moduli stabilization procedure, and consequently we ignore it.

\paragraph{String Loop Corrections - } The effective ten-dimensional action of Type IIB strings receives additional corrections from string loop effects, both in the bulk part and in the local one. Such corrections, which are poorly understood, are governed by the string coupling constant $g_s$. In the bulk part of the ten-dimensional action they first appear at order $\left(\alpha'\right)^3$, so that they can be though about as a further $g_s$-expansion of each term in the action $S_{\rm IIB}$ in eq. \eqref{eq:CorrectedEffectiveAction}, starting from $\left(\alpha'\right)^3 S_{0, (3)}$. String loop corrections have been computed for Type IIB orientifolds on tori with D5/D9 and D3/D7-branes in~\cite{Berg:2004ek, Berg:2005ja}. Starting from those results, it is possible to guess the volume and dilaton dependence of string loop corrections in the case of a generic CY~\cite{vonGersdorff:2005bf, Cicoli:2007xp, Cicoli:2008va, Berg:2007wt}. In general there are two contributions to the \Kahler potential:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first contribution comes from the exchange between D3-branes (or O3-planes) and D7-branes (or O7-planes) of closed strings which carry KK momentum. For this reason they are labeled with a index KK:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KKStringLoopCorrections}
\delta K^{\rm KK}_{(g_s)} = - \frac{1}{128 \pi^4} \sum_{i=1}^{h^{(1,1)}} \frac{\mathcal{C}_i^{\rm KK}(U, \overline{U}) \left(a_{il} t^l\right)}{\text{Re}(S) {V}} \,,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{C}_i^{\rm KK}$ are complicate unknown functions of the complex structure moduli which can be computed explicitly only with a full stringy calculation. $a_{il} t^l$ is a linear combination of the two-cycles volumes $t^i$.
\item The second contribution from string loops comes from the exchange of winding strings between intersecting stacks of D7-branes (or between intersecting D7-branes and O7-planes). It takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:WindingStringLoopCorrections}
\delta K^{\rm W}_{(g_s)} = - \frac{1}{128 \pi^4} \sum_{i=1}^{h^{(1,1)}} \frac{\mathcal{C}_i^{\rm W}(U, \overline{U})}{\left(a_{il} t^l\right) {V}} \,,
\end{align}
where again $\mathcal{C}_i^{\rm W}$ requires a full stringy computation to be calculated. $a_{il} t^l$ is a linear combination of the two-cycles volumes $t^i$. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Non-perturbative effects - } As we already mentioned, non-perturbative effects are well understood only from a four-dimensional point of view. In case non-perturbative effects take place, the superpotential can be written as~\cite{Blumenhagen:2006ci, Bergshoeff:2005yp, Lust:2005cu, Lust:2005dy, Lust:2006zg, Blumenhagen:2009qh}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NonPerturbativeEffects}
W = W_0 + \sum_{j = 1} A_j (\phi, S,U) e^{-a_j T_j} \,,
\end{align}
where the sum takes into account all the contributions from both D3-brane instantons and from gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes. $\phi$ collectively denotes the (possibly present) open strings degrees of freedom associated with the stack of D7-branes on which gaugino condensation takes place. In general $A(\phi, S, U)$ is an unknown function of $\phi, U, S$. More in detail:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[a)] \textbf{D3 branes instantons - } They can be obtained by wrapping Euclidean D3-branes on four-cycles of the compact space $\chi$. In this case it turns out that $a_j = 2 \pi$. Such superpotential is generated only if precisely two fermionic zero modes are present on the world volume of the Euclidean D3-branes. In F-theory and M-theory such condition can be rephrased in terms of the arithmetic genus $\chi$ of the divisor $\Sigma$ wrapped by the Euclidean M5-branes \cite{Witten:1996bn}
\begin{align}
\chi(\Sigma) = h^{(0,0)} - h^{(0,1)} + h^{(0,2)} - h^{(0,3)} = 1\,.
\end{align}
A similar condition can be stated in Type IIB in some specific cases. It is important to notice that the zero-modes counting can be substantially modified in presence of three-form fluxes and orientifolds \cite{Bergshoeff:2005yp, Lust:2006zg, Kallosh:2005yu, Kallosh:2005gs}. For example in \cite{Lust:2005cu} it has been shown that the component $G^{(1,2)}_3$ of the three-form flux can lift some zero modes.
\item[b)] \textbf{Gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes -} We consider a stack of space-time filling D7-branes wrapped around a four-cycle $D$ in the internal space. The relevant physics is given by the open string spectrum on the D7-branes world volume. There are several possibilities. We mention two of them \cite{Lust:2005dy, Intriligator:1995au}:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Pure $\mathcal{N} = 1$ Yang-Mills theory with gauge group G.}
 In this case gaugino condensation generates a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential of the form
 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:PureYMSuperpotential}
 W_{\rm np} \sim \Lambda^3 = e^{- \frac{8 \pi^2}{b g^2}} = e^{- 2 \pi \text{Vol}(D)}\,,
 \end{align}
 where we used that $\text{Vol}(D) = \text{Re}(T) = \frac{4 \pi}{g^2}$ and $b$ is the $\beta$-function of $g$:
 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:BetaFunction}
 \frac{1}{g^2(\mu)} = \frac{1}{g_0^2} - \frac{b}{16 \pi^2} \log \left(\frac{\Lambda_{\rm UV}}{\mu^2}\right)\,,
 \end{align}
 where $g_0 = \sqrt{\frac{4 \pi}{\text{Re}(T)}}$ is the bare gauge coupling fixed at $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$, while $\mu$ is a generic energy scale.
 \item \textit{$\mathcal{N} = 1$ Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with gauge group $SU(N_c)$ and $N_F$ matter fields $Q, \tilde{Q}$ in the representations $N_F \left(N_c \oplus \overline{N}_c\right)$.}
 In this case a superpotential of the form
 \begin{align}
 \label{eq:SuperpotentialYMMatter}
 W_{\rm np} = \left(N_c - N_F\right) \left(\frac{\Lambda^b}{\text{det} Q \tilde{Q}}\right)^{\frac{1}{N_c - N_F}}\,,
 \end{align}
is generated if $N_c > N_F$, where $b = 3 N_c - N_F$ is the $\beta$-function of SQCD. $\Lambda$ is the energy scale at which the VEV of $Q \tilde{Q}$ breaks the gauge group $SU(N_c)$ to $SU(N_c - N_F)$. If $N_c \leq N_F$ no non-perturbative superpotential is generated.
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As a final comment, let us remark that it is not possible to generate a non-perturbative effect on a geometric cycle which also supports a stack of D7-branes giving rise to the visible sector~\cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm}. This is a consequence of the chirality of the MSSM (or some extensions thereof) which makes the \Kahler modulus $T$ associated to the four-cycle wrapped by D7-branes charged under an anomalous $U(1)$. As a consequence of gauge invariance of the superpotential, the non-perturbative contribution can only have the following schematic form~\cite{Conlon:2008wa}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NPSuperpotentialMatter}
W_{\rm np} \sim \left(\prod_i \phi^i_{\rm hidden}\right) \left(\prod_j \phi^j_{\rm visible}\right) e^{-a T}\,.
\end{align}
However, since the visible fields are required to have vanishing VEV, such a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential can not arise. This argument pushes towards the possibility of building the visible sector on top of a singularity of the compact space, where this problem can be avoided, as we will see in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}.


\subsubsection{Large Volume Scenario}
\label{sssec:LVS}

The \textit{Large Volume Scenario} (LVS) provides a quite generic way to stabilize \Kahler\\moduli by using an interplay of non-perturbative and $\alpha'$-corrections, which break the no-scale structure of eq. \eqref{eq:NoScaleStructure}~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}. In this picture both the dilaton $S$ and the complex structure moduli $U^a$ are stabilized at tree-level, as already explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:TreeLevelModuliStabilization}. In the present section we take for simplicity $h^{(1,1)}_- = 0$. In the simplest version of the LVS the volume of the compact space takes the so-called ``swiss cheese'' form:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VolumeLVS}
{V} = \alpha_b \tau_b^{3/2} - \sum_{i=2}^{h^{(1,1)}_+} \alpha_i \tau_i^{3/2}\,,
\end{align}
where $\tau_b = \text{Re}(T_b)$ and $\tau_i = \text{Re}(T_i)$ govern respectively the size of the so called ``big'' four-cycle and ``small'' four-cycles, such that $\tau_b \gg \tau_i$. Since the big cycle is much larger than the small ones, the volume is dominated by its value. $\alpha_b$, $\alpha_i$ are constants determined by the intersection numbers of the compact space. In the following we will fix $\alpha_b = \alpha_i = 1$, unless differently specified. Non-perturbative effects due to E$3$-instantons or gaugino condensation on stacks of D7-branes take place on the small cycles, so that the superpotential takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LVSSuperpotential}
W = W_0(U,S) + \sum_{i = 2}^{h^{(1,1)}_+} A_i(U,S,\phi) e^{-a_i T_i}\,,
\end{align}
while the \Kahler potential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LVsKahlerPotential}
K = - 2 \log\left({V} + \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\right) - \log\left(S + \overline{S}\right) + \log\left(i \int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where we have included the leading $\alpha'$-corrections introduced in Sec.~\ref{sssec:CorrectionsToTreeLevel}. Notice that in order to use LVS it is necessary that $\xi$ in eq. \eqref{eq:XiHat} is negative, namely the CY manifold needs to have more complex structure moduli than \Kahler moduli~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}: $h^{(1,2)}_- > h^{(1,1)}_+$.\\

For the sake of simplicity we consider the case in which $h^{(1,1)}_+ = 2$, and we denote the \Kahler modulus associated to the small cycle $T_2 \equiv T_s$. The F-terms scalar potential at leading order in the volume expansion has the same form as in eq. \eqref{eq:ScalarPotentialNoScale}, despite the presence of $\alpha'$-corrections. Such a scalar potential fixes the dilaton and the complex structure moduli at the supersymmetric minimum in eq. \eqref{eq:GlobalMinimum} which we now rewrite as
\begin{align}
\label{susyminim}
\left.D_S W_0\right|_{\xi  = 0} = 0\ , \qquad D_{U^a} W_0 \big{|}_{\xi = 0} = 0\, ,
\end{align}
where the subscript $\xi = 0$ means that $\alpha'$-corrections can be ignored at this level of approximation, since they are sub-leading. The K\"ahler moduli are stabilized using $\alpha'$-corrections to $K$ \eqref{generalk} and non-perturbative corrections to $W_0$ which give rise to ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$ contributions to the scalar potential of the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LVSScalarPotential}
V_{\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)} = \frac{1}{2 s} \left[\frac{8}{3}(a_s A_s)^2 \sqrt{\tau_s} \frac{e^{- 2 a_s \tau_s}}{\mathcal{V}}
- 4 a_s A_s W_0 	\tau_s \frac{e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{\mathcal{V}^2 } + \frac{3\hat\xi W_0^2}{4\mathcal{V}^3}\right]\, ,
\end{align}
where as a generic feature of LVS, the axion field in the exponents of the non-perturbative effect is stabilized in such a way that the scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:LVSScalarPotential} admits a minimum\footnote{The first term in the scalar potential of eq. \eqref{eq:LVSScalarPotential} has to be positive, while the second one has to be negative.}. The last term in the bracket is due to $\alpha'$-corrections. The scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:LVSScalarPotential} admits an AdS global minimum which breaks SUSY. Minimization with respect to $\tau_s$ yields
\begin{align}
e^{- a_s \tau_s} = \frac{3 \sqrt{\tau_s} W_0}{4 a_s A_s \mathcal{V}} \frac{\left(1-4\epsilon_s\right)}{\left(1-\epsilon_s\right)}\qquad\text{with}\qquad \epsilon_s \equiv\frac{1}{4 a_s \tau_s}\sim{O}\left(\frac{1}{\ln\mathcal{V}}\right)\ll 1\,.
\label{eq:TaubMinimum}
\end{align}
On the other hand, minimization with respect to $\tau_b$ gives
\begin{align}
\tau_s^{3/2} \simeq \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\,.
\label{eq:TausMinimum}
\end{align}
From eq. \eqref{eq:TaubMinimum} we infer that the minimum of the LVS scalar potential lies at exponentially large volume ${V} \gg 1$. Furthermore, since ${V} \sim e^{a_s \tau_s}$ and $\tau_s \sim \hat{\xi}$, we understand that the existence of a hierarchy is determined by the smallness of the string coupling constant $g_s \ll 1$ in the perturbative regime. A nice feature of LVS is that $W_0$ does not require to be fine-tuned in order to get a minimum, as it happens in the KKLT setup \cite{Kachru:2003aw}, where $W_0 \sim e^{- \tau}$, with $\tau$ denoting here the size of the four cycle which governs the volume of the compact space. Unfortunately the minimum in eq.s \eqref{eq:TaubMinimum} and \eqref{eq:TausMinimum} is not de Sitter, so that for the compactification to reproduce the real world some additional ingredients need to be added. Further ingredients are also required in order to embed the visible sector into the compactification, since this can not be supported on a four-cycle whose size is stabilized through non-perturbative effects, as the small cycles in the LVS setup.\\

Let us briefly summarize the main properties of LVS relevant for soft SUSY-breaking:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\it Hierarchy of scales:} LVS leads to a hierarchy of scales for masses and soft-terms~\cite{Conlon:2005ki}.
In terms of the volume ${V}$, the string scale is (see Appendix~A of~\cite{Conlon:2005ki} for the derivation of the exact pre-factors)
\begin{align}
M_s = \frac{g_s^{1/4} M_{\rm P}}{\sqrt{4\pi\mathcal{V}}}\,,
\label{Ms}
\end{align}
the Kaluza-Klein scale is
\begin{align}
M_\KK\simeq \frac{M_{\rm P}}{\sqrt{4\pi}\mathcal{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\label{MKK}
\end{align}
and the gravitino mass is\footnote{We set the VEV of the K\"ahler potential for complex structure moduli such that $e^{{K_{\rm cs}}/2}=1$.}
\begin{align}
m_{3/2} = e^{K/2} |W|= \left(\frac{g_s^{1/2}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}\right) \frac{W_0 M_{\rm P}}{\mathcal{V}} +\ldots\, ,
\label{m32}
\end{align}
where the dots indicate suppressed corrections in the inverse volume expansion. Most of the moduli receive a mass of order $m_{3/2}$ except for the volume mode whose mass is $m_\mathcal{V} \simeq m_{3/2}/\sqrt{\mathcal{V}}$. Hence there is a natural hierarchy of scales $M_s\gg M_\KK\gg m_{3/2}\gg m_\mathcal{V}$ for the flux superpotential $W_0$ taking generic values between $1-100$.

\item {\it Bottom-up model building:} The D-branes configuration of the visible sector is localized in a particular corner of the bulk geometry, allowing for a realization of the bottom-up approach to string model building~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa}. The structure of soft-terms does not depend on the gauge theory realized in the visible sector but only on the type of D-branes configuration (e.g. branes at singularities, D7-branes in the geometric regime) as in the modular approach to string model building. The realization of the visible sector on a cycle different from the one supporting non-perturbative effects allows to achieve compatibility of chirality and moduli stabilization~\cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm,Cicoli:2011qg}.

\item {\it SUSY-breaking:} Assuming a D-branes configuration that leads to the MSSM, the effective field theory allows to analyze the structure of soft-masses. In particular, the pattern of soft masses depends on the location and type of the MSSM D-branes construction in the CY orientifold compactification. If the MSSM is located at a divisor geometrically separated from the main sources of SUSY-breaking in the bulk, e.g.~on a shrinking divisor, there can be a hierarchical suppression of the soft masses below the gravitino mass and the lightest modulus~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}. If the dominant source of SUSY-breaking is in the proximity of the visible sector brane configuration (as it happens if the F-term of the modulus of the cycle wrapped by the SM brane breaks SUSY), the soft masses are of order the gravitino mass with only mild suppressions~\cite{Conlon:2005ki, Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm,Shin:2011uk}.
\end{itemize}

Generically moduli masses tend to be of order the gravitino mass, as we have seen in eq. \eqref{eq:FluxesMasses} and \eqref{m32}. In view of the Cosmological Moduli Problem (CMP) which sets a lower bound on moduli masses of order $100$ TeV~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci,Banks:1993en,deCarlos:1993ja}, it is often desirable to have soft masses well below the gravitino/moduli masses although achieving this requires a special mechanism at play. We will refer to models which have hierarchically suppressed soft masses (not just by loop factors) as sequestered models.\footnote{A similar suppression appears also in the context of realizations of the KKLT scenario~\cite{Choi:2005ge}.} Depending on the location of SM particles and the value of the CY volume, we distinguish three interesting LVS scenarios for SUSY-breaking:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Unsequestered GUT scale string models:}
Motivated by unification, if one takes the string scale to be close to the GUT scale $10^{14}-10^{16}$ GeV, where the range in the volume captures the uncertainty about high-scale threshold corrections, then the volume is of order $\mathcal{V}\simeq 10^{3}-10^{7}$ for $g_s\simeq 0.1$. This implies a large gravitino mass, $m_{3/2}\simeq 10^{10}-10^{14}$ GeV, i.e.~unobservable sparticles, unless the flux superpotential is tuned to extremely small values (tuning of up to $W_0\sim 10^{-10}$) to get TeV soft-terms.\footnote{TeV scale soft masses in this scenario would lead to light moduli which suffer from the CMP since $m_\mathcal{V} \simeq 10$ GeV.} So the generic situation without tuning $W_0$ is that soft-terms are at an intermediate scale, roughly in the range $10^{10}-10^{14}$ GeV. This scenario is safe from the CMP. The string landscape can in principle address the hierarchy problem.

\item{\bf Unsequestered intermediate scale strings:}
Requiring TeV scale soft-terms in an unsequestered setting leads to a volume of order $\mathcal{V}\simeq 10^{14}$ for $W_0\sim 10$, implying an intermediate string scale, $M_s\simeq 5\cdot 10^{10}$ GeV. This scenario addresses the hierarchy problem, although unification has to work differently from the MSSM (see~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sk, Dolan:2011qu,Cicoli:2013mpa} for concrete string examples with intermediate scale unification). Its spectrum of soft-terms at the electroweak scale has been studied in~\cite{Conlon:2007xv}. It suffers from the CMP since the volume modulus mass is slightly below 1 MeV.

\item{\bf Sequestered high scale string models:}
There can be special situations in which the soft-terms are hierarchically smaller than the gravitino mass, referred to as sequestered scenarios~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In LVS this happens in configurations in which the Standard Model degrees of freedom are localized in the extra-dimensions, such as in models where the visible sector arises from open strings on D3-branes at a singularity. In particular, in this setup the F-term of the Standard Model cycle vanishes and the dominant F-terms are associated with other moduli (the volume modulus, the dilaton and other K\"ahler and complex structure moduli).
However the dominant F-terms couple very weakly to the visible sector because of their bulk separation, and this produces a hierarchy between the soft-terms and the gravitino mass. Typically gaugino masses are of order $M_{1/2}\simeq m_{3/2}/\mathcal{V}$, whereas scalar masses can be as suppressed as the gaugino masses or hierarchically larger by a power $\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ (leading to a Split-SUSY scenario in this last case). This makes these models very attractive for phenomenology since they feature TeV scale soft-terms and no CMP for $\mathcal{V}\simeq 10^7$ and $W_0\simeq 50$ which give
$M_{1/2}\simeq 1$~TeV, $m_{3/2}\simeq 10^{10}$ GeV and $m_\mathcal{V} \simeq 5\cdot 10^6$ GeV. The unification scale in these models is set by the winding scale $M_W = 2 \pi\sqrt{\pi g_s} M_{\rm P} / \mathcal{V}^{1/3}$~\cite{Conlon:2009xf,Conlon:2009kt} which turns out to be of the same order of the standard GUT scale. The appearance of this hierarchical suppression of soft masses is subject to the structure of the effective supergravity. Changes to the EFT at loop or non-perturbative level (see for instance~\cite{Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm, Berg:2010ha, Conlon:2011jq,Berg:2012aq}) can lead to desequestering. In Sec.~\ref{sec:DesequesteringSources} we comment more explicitly on possible sources for desequestering while in the rest of the chapter we assume that these desequestering effects are absent.
\end{enumerate}

In this thesis we focus our attention on sequestered models, hence we need to introduce D3-branes at singularities.

\subsection{Visible Sector}
\label{ssec:VisibleSector}

As we already discussed, the visible sector in Type IIB can be obtained through a D-branes configuration~\cite{Maharana:2012tu}. In order to get a sequestered scenario as described in the last section, we focus on space-time filling D3-branes configurations. The spectrum of a D3-brane is summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:D3Spectrum}. 
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\hline
Sector & $4$D field \\
\hline
NS & 1 Gauge Boson: $A_\mu$ \\
NS & 6 Real Scalars: $\phi^i$ \\
\hline
RR & 4 Majorana Fermions: $\lambda_\alpha$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Spectrum of a D3-brane worldvolume theory.}
\label{tab:D3Spectrum}
\end{table}
The fields in Tab.~\ref{tab:D3Spectrum} compose a $U(1)$ multiplet of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ four-dimensional supersymmetry. As a consequence, the worldvolume theory of a D3-brane is not chiral, and the same happens for the straightforward generalization to a stack of $N$ D3-branes, whose spectrum can be arranged in $U(N)$\footnote{Assuming that the D3-branes are not placed on top of an orientifold plane. In the last case also the gauge groups $SO(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ could be obtained.} multiplets of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetry. The only known way to allow for chirality in the case of space-time filling D3-branes, is by placing the stack on top of a singularity inside the compact space~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa, Douglas:1996sw, Douglas:1997de, Kachru:1998ys, Lawrence:1998ja, Hanany:1998it}. D3-branes at singularities constitute the quintessential realization of the bottom-up approach, since the visible degrees of freedom arise from a single point in the compact space. In this case the largest possible separation between gauge degrees of freedom and bulk ones takes place, allowing to tackle moduli stabilization and D-branes model building almost independently. The separation is more accentuated if D7 flavour branes are absent in the compactification, since they would couple directly visible fields to the bulk. For this reason we avoid the presence of D7 flavour branes, and we assume that the MSSM comes from a D3-branes construction.\\

As an example of the power of the bottom-up approach we report a very simple argument to deduce the volume scaling of the \Kahler matter metric of visible scalar fields~\cite{Conlon:2008wa}. As it is well known, physical Yukawa couplings $\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ take the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HolomorphicYukawaCoupling}
\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = e^{K/2} \frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}}{\sqrt{\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma}} \,,
\end{align}
in terms of the holomorphic Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ and of the \Kahler matter metric (assuming it is flavour diagonal) $\tilde{K}_\alpha$. Since physical Yukawa couplings should be generated by gauge interactions taking place on top of the D3-branes which correspond to a single point in the compact space, then it is reasonable to assume that they do not depend on the volume of the compactification space. This translates into the following volume scaling for the \Kahler matter metric
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerMatterMetricScaling}
\tilde{K}_\alpha \approx \frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}} \,.
\end{align}
As we will observe in the next section, this is exactly the leading order scaling obtained by performing the Kaluza-Klein reduction.\\

As we consider a specific kind of singularities, called \textit{del Pezzo singularities}, from a geometrical point of view the most intuitive description of D3-branes at singularities can be given in terms of the del Pezzo divisor hosting them, in the non-singular (or ``blow-up'') limit~\cite{Malyshev:2007zz}. A del Pezzo surface $dP_n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 8$) is a four-cycle inside the CY manifold which contains several non-trivial two-cycles $H_i$. In general, for a $dP_n$ surface, the non-vanishing Hodge numbers are given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:HodgeDelPezzo}
h^{(0,0)}_{\rm dP} = 1 \,, \qquad h^{(1,1)}_{\rm dP} = n + 1 \,, \qquad h^{(2,2)}_{\rm dP} = 1 \,,
\end{align}
so that the Euler characteristic of a $dP_n$ is $\chi(dP_n) = n + 3$. In the non-singular limit $dP_n$ divisors can be wrapped by D7-branes, $H_i$ can be wrapped by D5-branes, while $0$-cycles inside $dP_n$ can support D3-branes. In general, not every D-branes configuration is a stable one: only BPS states are minimum-energy states and then they are stable. A stack of D3-branes forms a stable configuration if placed at a smooth point of a CY manifold, but D-branes get recombined into \textit{fractional branes} if placed on top of a singularity. Fractional branes configurations can be described as a stable bound states of D3/D5/D7-branes respectively wrapping the $0/2/4$-cycles of the del Pezzo divisor hosting the D-branes configuration~\cite{Malyshev:2007zz}.

\subsubsection{Dimensional Reduction}

In order to study the EFT arising from a stack of $N$ D3-branes, it is necessary to perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction~\cite{Grana:2003ek}, as we already reviewed for the bulk theory in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ModuliSpace}. The action governing the dynamics of a stack of $N$ D3-branes contains two contributions. The first one is the non-abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action, which in the string frame reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DBIAction}
S_{\rm DBI} = - \mu_3 \int_{\mathcal{W}} d^{4}\xi \,\, \text{Tr} e^{-\phi} \sqrt{- \text{det} \left[\varphi^* \mathbf{T}_{\mu \nu} + 2 \pi \alpha' F_{\mu \nu}\right]	 \text{det} Q^n_m}\,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:E}
\mathbf{T}_{\mu \nu} = E_{\mu \nu} + E_{\mu n} \left(Q^{-1} -\delta\right)^{nm} E_{m \nu}\,, \qquad E = g + B \,,
\end{align}
$\mu_3$ has already been introduced in eq. \eqref{eq:DpTension}, $\mathcal{W}$ denotes the D3-brane space-time filling worldvolume, $\xi$ collectively denotes the coordinates on $\mathcal{W}$ and $\varphi: \mathcal{W} \hookrightarrow M$ is the embedding map of the D3-branes into the ten-dimensional space-time $M$. $F_{\mu \nu}$ denotes the field strength of the $U(N)$ gauge theory described by the D3-branes configuration. Moreover we define
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Qnm}
Q^n_m = \delta^n_m + 2 i \pi \alpha' \left[\phi^n, \phi^k\right] E_{km} \,, \quad n, m = 1, \dots, 6 \,,
\end{align}
where the six scalar fields $\phi^i$ parametrize the position of the D3-brane inside the compact space, and transform in the adjoint representation of $U(N)$. The DBI action provides the coupling between the open strings degrees of freedom and the NSNS fields of the bulk theory.\\

The second contribution to the D3-branes action is given by the Chern-Simon action, which reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:D3CS}
S_{\rm CS} = \mu_3 \int_{\mathcal{W}} \text{Tr} \left(\varphi^* \left(e^{2 i \pi \alpha' \, i_\phi i_\phi} \sum_{q \,\text{even}} C_q e^B\right) e^{2 \pi \alpha' F}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where $i_\phi$ denotes the interior multiplication of a form with the field $\phi^n$, which can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:InteriorProduct}
i_{\phi} C_q = \frac{1}{q!} \sum_{k = 1}^q \, (-1)^{k+1} \phi^n \left(C_q\right)_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_{k-1} n \nu_{k+1} \dots \nu_q} dx^{\nu_1} \wedge \dots \wedge \widehat{dx^k} \wedge \dots \wedge dx^{\nu_q}\,,
\end{align}
where the differential with the $\widehat{\quad}$ is omitted. The CS action provides the coupling between the opens strings degrees of freedom and the RR fields of the bulk theory.\\

The KK reduction is a quite long procedure and it contains many subtleties. Here we just want to emphasize the main points \cite{Grana:2003ek}:
\begin{itemize}
\item As a first step it is necessary to compute the pull-back of the ten-dimensional fields $g$ and $B$ which appear in the actions in eq.s \eqref{eq:DBIAction} and \eqref{eq:D3CS}. However, in order to capture all the degrees of freedom arising from a D3-branes configuration, it is necessary to perturb the background map $\varphi$. Schematically
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PerturbedEmbeddingMap}
\varphi \quad \rightarrow \quad \varphi + \delta \varphi \,,
\end{align}
so that $\delta \varphi$ takes into account the fluctuations of the D3-brane in the directions orthogonal to its world-volume. Such a procedure is called \textit{normal coordinate expansion}.
\item It is necessary to expand the square root of the determinant of the field $Q^n_m$, taking into account the non-abelian nature of the fields $\phi^i$, which leads to
\begin{align}
\sqrt{\text{det} Q^i_j} = 1 + \frac{i}{4 \pi \alpha'} \left[\phi^m, \phi^n\right] \phi^k \partial_k B_{nm} + \left(\pi \alpha'\right)^2 g_{mn} g_{pq} \left[\phi^p, \phi^m\right] \left[\phi^n, \phi^q\right] + \dots\,, \nonumber
\end{align}
where the $\dots$ denote fields which vanish after taking the trace in the lagrangian.
\item In the KK reduction of the Chern-Simon action, the four-form $C_4$ is expanded around its background value, which is determined by the condition $\alpha = e^{4 A}$. We allow for small perturbations around this background value, which means taking into account a small, non-ISD component for $G_3$. As a consequence the solution breaks supersymmetry and deviates from the class of warped compactifications in Tab.~\ref{tab:IIBN1vacua}. We assume that this is a very small departure from the supersymmetric background, so that we can treat it perturbatively, without destroying the solution.
\item Once the reduction has been performed, it is necessary to recast all the expressions in terms of chiral superfields, and then it is necessary to find a complex structure which is compatible with $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry. It turns out that the complex structure $J$ of the compact space is the correct choice. A key point in this step is that a mixing between complex structure moduli and open strings degrees of freedom takes place, so that \Kahler moduli need to be redefined differently from eq. \eqref{eq:FieldRedefinition}, as follows~\cite{Grana:2003ek}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:D3FieldRedefinition}
T_i = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{K}_i - \zeta_i + 4i \pi^2 \left(\alpha'\right)^2 \mu_3 \left(\omega_i\right)_{m \overline{n}} \text{Tr} \left[\phi^m \left(\overline{\phi}^{\overline{n}} - \frac{i}{2} \overline{U}^a \left(\chi_a\right)^{\overline{n}}_p \phi^p\right)\right] \,,
\end{align}
where the trace is performed on the gauge indexes. In the case of a single \Kahler modulus $T$, the moduli space takes the same form as in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotential}, but with a different $\mathcal{K} \equiv \mathcal{K}(\tau,T_i,G^\kappa,U^a,\phi^i)$:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerPotentialD3}
K=-2 \text{log}&\,  \mathcal{K} = -3 \text{log} \left[T + \overline{T} + \zeta_1 + 12i \pi^2 \left(\alpha'\right)^2 \mu_3 \left(\omega_1\right)_{m \overline{n}} \text{Tr} \left(\phi^m \overline{\phi}^{\overline{n}}\right) +\right. \nonumber \\
&+\left. 3 \pi^2 \left(\alpha'\right)^2 \mu_3 \left(\left(\omega_1\right)_{m \overline{n}} \overline{U}^a \left(\overline{\chi}_a\right)^{\overline{n}}_p \text{Tr} \left(\phi^m \phi^p + \text{h.c.}\right)\right)\right]\,.&
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
From the \Kahler potential in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotentialD3} it is possible to infer the same scaling behavior of eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerMatterMetricScaling} for the \Kahler matter metric:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerMatterMetricScalingKK}
\tilde{K}_{m \overline{n}} \approx \frac{\left(\omega_1\right)_{m \overline{n}}}{T + \overline{T}} \,.
\end{align}

Notice that in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerPotentialD3} the complex structure moduli mix with the \Kahler moduli in $\mathcal{K}$ so that the moduli space is no longer of the diagonal form as in eq. \eqref{eq:ModuliSpace}. If warping effects are taken into account as in~\cite{Martucci:2014ska}, then an additional correction with the same volume scaling as the \Kahler matter metric in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerMatterMetricScalingKK} can appear. In the present thesis we neglect this possibility.

\subsubsection{D3-branes at Singularities}
\label{sssec:D3atSingularities}

Every time a manifold features a discrete symmetry, it is possible to build a new manifold by identifying points under the corresponding transformation. The possible fixed points under the action of the transformation are singularities of the new compactification manifold, called \textit{orbifold singularities}. Orbifold singularities are the simplest singularities which can be encountered, and in particular $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$ which is equivalent to a $dP_0$ divisor whose size is shrunk to zero, is an orbifold singularity. In such a singularity fractional branes have to form a representation of $\mathbb{Z}_3$, namely the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ action has to act by interchanging fractional branes placed at three image points. A D3-brane at a singularity splits into 3 fractional branes, each of which carrying $1/3$ of the original D3-brane mass.\\

The interesting feature of singularities, from a phenomenological point of view, is that by placing a stack of D3-branes on top of a singular point in the compact space it is possible to get a chiral spectrum, starting from a non-chiral $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric theory. There is also an additional reason to consider such models. As we discussed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:CorrectionsToTreeLevel}, it is not possible to conciliate the stabilization of the size of an internal four-cycle of the manifold with chirality, which is an essential feature of our world~\cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm}. As a consequence it is not possible to both build the visible sector on top of a stack of branes wrapping a four-cycle in the geometric regime (as the ``small'' cycle in the simplest LVS setup), and stabilize it through non-perturbative effects like E$3$-instantons or gaugino condensation on D7-branes. A possible way-out is represented by D3-branes at singularities constructions \cite{Conlon:2008wa}. In fact, let us assume that the visible gauge sector is hosted by a stack of D7-branes wrapping a four-cycle (whose associated \Kahler modulus is $T_{\rm vis}$) inside the compact space. The chiral nature of the observable world implies the existence of anomalous $U(1)$'s, under which the modulus $T_{\rm vis}$ is charged. We assume for the simplicity of the argument that there is only a single anomalous $U(1)$, so that $T_{\rm vis}$ transforms as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ChargedVisibleModulus}
\delta_\lambda T_{\rm vis} = T_{\rm vis} + i Q_{T_{\rm vis}} \lambda\,,
\end{align}
where $Q_{T_{\rm vis}}$ is the charge of the modulus $T_{\rm vis}$ under the anomalous $U(1)$, and $\lambda$ is the parameter of the transformation. It generates a D-terms scalar potential which takes the schematic form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DTermPotential}
V_D \sim \left(\sum_i c_i \left|\Phi^i_{\rm vis}\right|^2 - \xi\right)^2\,,
\end{align}
where $\Phi^i_{\rm vis}$ represent the visible scalar fields, $c_i$ denotes generic coefficients and $\xi$ is the $T_{\rm vis}$-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term. This part of the scalar potential fixes $T_{\rm vis}$ such that the combination $\sum_i c_i \left|\Phi^i_{\rm vis}\right|^2 = \xi$, leaving as many flat directions as the number of visible fields charged under the anomalous $U(1)$. This degeneracy is then lifted by sub-leading supersymmetry breaking effects, which contribute to the scalar potential with terms like $m^2 \left|\Phi^i_{\rm vis}\right|^2$. In order for the visible fields not to roll down to charge or color breaking minima, the mass squared $m^2$ has to be positive. In such a way the visible scalar fields are fixed at $\Phi^i_{\rm vis} = 0$, which implies also $\xi = T_{\rm vis} = 0$. As a consequence the size of the four-cycle which supports the visible sector is fixed at zero size: the singularity is obtained in a dynamical way. We will study the details of such a model in Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms}.\\

Interestingly, from the previous argument it is also possible to infer the tree-level contribution of $T_{\rm vis}$ to the \Kahler potential \cite{Conlon:2008wa}. Indeed, the D-terms scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:DTermPotential} arises from an anomalous $U(1)$ which get massive due to the Green-Schwarz mechanism. It is possible to compute that the mass of such a field is given by the string scale $m_{U(1)}^2 \simeq M_s^2$, and since
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MassU1}
m_{U(1)}^2 \simeq M_{\rm P}^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{T}_{\rm vis}}\frac{\partial}{\partial T_{\rm vis}} K(T_{\rm vis} + \overline{T}_{\rm vis}) \,,
\end{align}
then the leading contribution to the \Kahler potential is given by
\begin{align}
K \supset \lambda_{\rm vis} \frac{\left(T_{\rm vis} + \overline{T}_{\rm vis} + q_{\rm vis} V_{\rm vis}\right)^2}{{V}} \,,
\end{align}
where $q_{\rm vis}$ is the charge of the modulus $T_{\rm vis}$ under the anomalous $U(1)$, while $V_{\rm vis}$ is the corresponding vector multiplet. $\lambda_{\rm vis}$ is a $\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$ unknown constant, which can not be computed in the EFT approach.\\

The crucial point is that models of D3-branes at singularities can be adjusted to support a realistic visible sector. We report here the gauge theories which is possible to get in presence of a stack of space-time filling D3-branes, placed on top of a generic $\mathbb{R}^6/\mathbb{Z}_n$ singularity \cite{Aldazabal:2000sa}. In terms of $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry, the fields arising from a stack of $N$ D3-branes can be arranged in $U(N)$ vector multiplets, and three adjoint chiral multiplets $\Phi^r$, whose components are the $6$ real scalar fields $\phi^i$ of Tab. \ref{tab:D3Spectrum}, transforming in the $\mathbf{6}$ of $SU(4) \simeq SO(6)$ plus $4$ adjoint fermions transforming in the $\mathbf{4}$ of $SU(4)$. In order to get a non-abelian gauge theory when a stack of $N$ D3-branes is considered, the states reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:D3Spectrum} for the single D3-brane case have to be supplemented by a Chan-Paton matrix $\lambda \equiv \lambda_{ij}$, where the indexes $i, j = 1, \dots, N$ refer to the branes on which open strings have their endpoints. Each D3-brane placed on top of a $\mathbb{R}^6/\mathbb{Z}_n$ singularity split into $n$ fractional branes, placed at $n$ image points under the action of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. The resulting spectrum is given by states which are invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ action.\\

The action of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ on fermions and scalars is given respectively by the matrices
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnAction}
\mathbf{R}_{\rm ferm}& = \text{diag} \left(e^{2 \pi i a_1/n}, e^{2 \pi i a_2/n}, e^{2 \pi i a_3/n}, e^{2 \pi i a_4/n}\right) \,, \nonumber\\
&\mathbf{R}_{\rm scal} = \text{diag} \left(e^{2 \pi i b_1/n}, e^{2 \pi i b_2/n}, e^{2 \pi i b_3/n}\right) \,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnActionConstraints}
&a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 0 \,\, \text{mod}\, n\,, \nonumber\\
b_1 = a_2 +& a_3 \,, \quad b_2 = a_1 + a_3 \,, \quad b_3 = a_1 + a_2 \,,
\end{align}
Furthermore, the action of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ needs to be embedded on the Chan-Paton indexes. The embedding is provided by the matrix
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnActionChanPaton}
\gamma_{\theta,\,3} = \text{diag} \left(\mathbf{1}_{n_0}, e^{2 \pi i/n} \mathbf{1}_{n_1}, \dots, e^{2 \pi (n - 1) i/n} \mathbf{1}_{n_{n-1}}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\sum_i n_i = n N$ and the matrices $\mathbf{1}_{n_i}$ are the $n_i \times n_i$ unit matrices. The spectrum of the gauge theory living on D3-branes at a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ singularity is obtained by keeping the states of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ theory which are invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ action. This is defined on the states as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Gauge bosons:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnProjectionBosons}
\lambda = \gamma_{\theta,\,3} \lambda \gamma_{\theta,\,3}^{-1} \,,
\end{align}
\item Fermions:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnProjectionFermions}
\lambda = e^{2 \pi i a_\alpha/n} \gamma_{\theta,\,3} \lambda \gamma_{\theta,\,3}^{-1} \,, \quad \alpha = 1, \dots, 4\,,
\end{align}
\item Complex scalars:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ZnProjectionScalars}
\lambda = e^{-2 \pi i b_r/n} \gamma_{\theta,\,3} \lambda \gamma_{\theta,\,3}^{-1} \,, \quad r = 1,2,3 \,.
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
The spectrum is finally given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:33Spectrum}
\text{Vectors}& &&\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} U(n_i) \,, \nonumber\\\\
\text{Complex scalars}& &&\sum_{r=1}^3 \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(n_i, \overline{n}_{i-b_r}\right) \,,\\
\text{Fermions}& &&\sum_{\alpha=1}^4 \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(n_i, \overline{n}_{i+a_{\alpha}}\right) \nonumber\\\,.
\end{align}
In general this spectrum is not supersymmetric, unless $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 0$, in which case $a_4 = 0$ and the fermions corresponding to $\alpha = 4$ turn out to transform as gauginos (in the adjoint representation of $U(n_i)$), while the fermions corresponding to $\alpha = 1,2,3$ transform in the same bi-fundamental representations as complex scalars. In this case complex scalars and fermions fill out a set of chiral multiplets, while gauge bosons and gauginos compose vector multiplets of the resulting $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric theory. The condition $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 0$ corresponds to the requirement that the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ action is contained in $SU(3)$, as expected given that it gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.\\

We are interested in the case $n = 3$, with $N = 3$ D3-branes at singularities each of which splits into 3 fractional branes placed at image points under the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ action, so that $n_i = 3$ for each $i = 0, 1, 2$. Generically the spectrum reported in eq. \eqref{eq:33Spectrum} is not free from anomalies, and it is necessary to include D7 flavour branes in the compactification in order to erase them. However, in the specific case with $n = 3$ and $n_i = 3$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$ anomalies are automatically canceled~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa}. The gauge group in this case is that of a \textit{trinification model}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TrinificationGaugeGroup}
G = SU(3)_{\rm col} \times SU(3)_{\rm L} \times SU(3)_{\rm R} \,,
\end{align}
and the spectrum arise from the following $27$ states
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TrinificationStates}
3 \, \left[(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{\overline{3}},\mathbf{1}), (\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{3},\mathbf{\overline{3}}), (\mathbf{\overline{3}}, \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{3})\right] \,.
\end{align}
Finally, since there is only a trivial overall $U(1)$ which decouples, the hypercharge has to arise from the $SU(3)_{\rm L} \times SU(3)_{\rm R}$ sector. The main problem of this model is that the structure of Yukawa couplings always generates a wrong hierarchy for fermion masses of the form $(M, M, 0)$, with two heavy and one massless generations~\cite{Conlon:2008wa, Maharana:2012tu}. 

\subsection{An Explicit Global Model}
\label{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}

In the present section we exhibit an explicit global embedding of the D3-branes at singularities setup, in which all the consistency conditions have been checked~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. In particular it is required that:
\begin{itemize}
\item moduli stabilization is performed in the LVS setup,
\item the visible sector is supported by D3-branes at singularities,
\item the compactification is self-consistent (tadpole cancellation, anomaly cancellation, etc.) and the EFT is trustable.
\end{itemize}
We consider Type IIB warped compactifications with O3/O7-planes. Since we require the gauge theory of the visible sector to be $SU(N)$, the singularity has to lie away from the O7-plane. As a consequence it is necessary to look for a CY manifold which contains two singularities, exchanged by the orientifold action whose fixed locus is an O7-plane. As we have discussed, LVS moduli stabilization requires at least a couple of additional four-cycles, so that the minimal setup contains at least four four-cycles. Finally, as explained in Sec.~\ref{ssec:VisibleSector}, it is required not to have D7 flavour branes, in order to maximize the effect of decoupling between gauge and bulk degrees of freedom. Gauge anomaly cancellation is automatically achieved in models of D3-branes at $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$ singularities without D7 flavour branes.\\

In~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw} the authors considered a scan among CY manifolds which are hypersurfaces in four dimensional toric ambient spaces~\cite{Kreuzer:2006ax, Skarke:1998yk, Denef:2008wq, CYData, Kreuzer:2002uu, Braun:2011ik, Braun:2012vh}, looking for one which satisfies the above requirements. The Hodge numbers of such a CY are $h^{(1,1)}_+ = 3$ and $h^{(1,1)}_- = 1$. From a technical point of view the authors looked for a CY containing two $dP_0$ divisors exchanged by the orientifold involution. They eventually checked that the point of the moduli space where these del Pezzo divisors shrink to zero size lies inside the \Kahler cone.\\

The CY manifold $\chi$ considered contains several divisors which we call $D_4$, $D_5$, $D_6$, $D_7$, $D_8$, of which $D_4$, $D_7$, $D_8$ are three non-intersecting $dP_0$ divisors. A basis for the four-cycles can be chosen as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:BasisH11}
\Gamma_b = D_6 + D_7 = D_4 + D_5 \,, \quad \Gamma_{q_1} = D_4 \,, \quad \Gamma_{q_2} = D_7 \,, \quad \Gamma_s = D_8 \,,
\end{align}
where the subscripts $b$ and $s$ refer respectively to the ``big'' and ``small'' cycles of LVS, while $q_i$ refer to the cycles supporting the visible sector.\\

The expression for the volume of the CY takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:VolumeExplicitCY}
{V} = \frac{1}{9} \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \left(\tau_b^{3/2} - \sqrt{3} \left(\tau_{q_1}^{3/2} + \tau_{q_2}^{3/2} + \tau_s^{3/2}\right)\right)\,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CyclesExplicit}
\tau_{q_1} = \text{Vol}(\Gamma_{q_1}) \,, \quad \tau_{q_2} = \text{Vol}(\Gamma_{q_2}) \,, \quad \tau_s = \text{Vol}(\Gamma_s) \,, \quad \tau_b = \text{Vol}(\Gamma_b)\,.
\end{align}
%In this setup there are two O7-planes, as reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:O7Planes}.
%\begin{table}[h!]
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{cc}
%\hline
%O$7$-planes & Homology class in $\chi$\\
%\hline
%O$7_1$ & $D_{O7_1} = \Gamma_b$ \\
%\hline
%O$7_2$ & $D_{O7_2} = \Gamma_s$ \\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\caption{O$7$-planes of the configuration.}
%\label{tab:O7Planes}
%\end{table}

We summarize the D-branes/O-planes configuration of the model:
\begin{itemize}
\item There are two non-intersecting O7-planes: one in the homology class $\Gamma_b$ and one in the homology class $\Gamma_s$.
\item In order to cancel the D7-charge generated by O7-planes, four D7-branes are placed on top of each O7-plane. This generates two hidden sectors $SO(8) \times SO(8)$, which can give rise to gaugino condensation.
\item The visible sector is realized by placing three D3-branes on top of the two singularities exchanged by the orientifold involution. In this way the gauge theory obtained is a trinification model $SU(3)^3$, which can be further broken to the MSSM gauge group~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. Gauge anomalies are automatically canceled.
\end{itemize}

As we have seen in Sec.~\ref{ssec:EqOfMotion} it is necessary to cancel the D3-branes charge. This is achieved taking into account the D3-branes charge generated by the presence of D7-branes. Schematically, the condition that is satisfied by the D-branes configuration takes the following form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:D3ChargeCancellationExplicit}
Q^{\rm quiver}_{D3} + Q^{\rm (b)}_{D3} + Q^{\rm (s)}_{D3} + Q^{\rm fluxes} = 0\,,
\end{align}
where $Q^{\rm quiver}_{D3}$ takes into account the contributions from the fractional D3-branes placed at the singularities, while $Q^{\rm (b)/(s)}_{D3}$ correspond to the contributions from D7-branes and O$7$-planes in the homology class $\Gamma_b$ and $\Gamma_s$ respectively.\\

After the involution and in the singular limit the relevant \Kahler moduli are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerModuliPaper}
T_b = \tau_b + i \psi_b \,, \qquad T_s = \tau_s + i \psi_s \,, \qquad T_{\rm SM} = \tau_{\rm SM} + i \psi_{\rm SM} \,, \qquad G = b + i c \,.
\end{align}
Both $\tau_{\rm SM}$ and $b$ tend to zero in the singular limit, so that they do not enter the expression of the volume in the \Kahler potential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:KahlerPotentialExplicit}
K = - 2 \text{log} \left({V} + \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\right) - \text{log} \left(S + \overline{S}\right) + \text{log} \left(i \int_\chi \Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega}\right) + \nonumber \\
+ \frac{\left(T_{\rm SM} + \overline{T}_{\rm SM} + q_{\rm SM} V_{\rm SM}\right)^2}{{V}} + \frac{\left(G + \overline{G} + q_G V_G\right)^2}{{V}} + \tilde{K_\alpha} C^\alpha \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}}\,,
\end{align}
In the definition of $T_{\rm SM}$ and $G$ we have considered the invariant cycle $D_{\rm SM} = D_4 + D_7$ such that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:InvariantCycle}
\tau_{\rm SM} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{D_{\rm SM}} J \wedge J \,, \quad \psi_{\rm SM} = \int_{D_{\rm SM}} C_4 \,,
\end{align}
and the anti-invariant cycle $D_- = D_4 - D_7$ so that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:AntiInvariantCycle}
b = \int_{\hat{D}_-} B_2 \,, \quad c = \int_{\hat{D}_-} C_2 \,.
\end{align}
Finally $q_{\rm SM}$, $q_G$ are the charges of the moduli $T_{\rm SM}$ and $G$ under the anomalous $U(1)$'s with vector multiplets $V_{\rm SM}$ and $V_G$ as we already discussed in the last section.\\

Finally, an important point is to check whether it is possible to get a non-perturbative effect at least on top of the small cycle, in order to perform \Kahler moduli stabilization in the LVS setup. The presence of chiral states on the stack of D7-branes in the homology classes $\Gamma_s$ and $\Gamma_b$, can destroy the possibility of having gaugino condensation. The simplest way to avoid this issue is by setting to zero on both stacks of D7-branes the gauge flux
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GaugeFlux}
\mathcal{F} = F - B\,,
\end{align}
where $F$ denotes the gauge flux of the D7-brane gauge theory. In general this is not a straightforward step, since once the condition $\mathcal{F} = 0$ is imposed on one stack of D7-branes, it could be not possible to impose the same condition on the second stack. However, in the properly chosen configuration of~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw} this is not the case, because the divisors belonging to the homology classes $\Gamma_s$ and $\Gamma_b$ have no intersections. There are two possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the field $B$ is chosen such that $\mathcal{F}_s = 0$ and $\mathcal{F}_b \neq 0$, then no non-perturbative effect for $T_b$ is generated. In this case it is possible to get a dS vacuum, since the non-vanishing flux on $\Gamma_b$ induces a non-zero $U(1)$ charge for $T_b$. As a consequence a D-terms in the scalar potential is generated, whose interplay with the F-terms part of the scalar potential leads to an uplifting contribution of the usual AdS vacuum of LVS. This kind of solution is that explicitly built in~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. Further details on the de Sitter mechanism are provided in Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift}.
\item If the field $B$ is chosen in such a way that $\mathcal{F} = 0$ on both $\Gamma_s$ and $\Gamma_b$, depending on the details of the model a non-perturbative effect for $T_b$ can be generated, but in general it is not possible to get a dS vacuum without the introduction of new elements in the compactification, such as anti-branes at the tip of warped throats~\cite{Kachru:2003aw} or new non-perturbative effects taking place on an additional singularity placed on top of the O7-plane~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. In Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift} we take into account the latter possibility. A global construction for such a de Sitter sector is still missing.
\end{enumerate}
In both cases the superpotential contains a non-perturbative term for the ``small'' cycle
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SuperpotentialExplicit}
W \supset A e^{- a_s T_s}\,,
\end{align}
which is needed in the LVS setup for \Kahler moduli stabilization. Finally in \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} the authors checked that in this setup it is possible to choose gauge fluxes and $B$-field in order to cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly in a way consistent with the generation of the non-perturbative superpotential terms.\\

In conclusion the configuration of D-branes/O-planes considered in \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} gives rise to a consistent global compactification, in which the visible sector is realized on top of D3-branes at singularities. The consistency of the compactification is ensured by tadpole cancellation, cancellation of Freed-Witten anomalies and cancellation of gauge anomalies. As we will observe in chapter \ref{chap:Soft-Terms} in this setup it is possible to stabilize all the closed moduli in the LVS setup, since a term as in eq. \eqref{eq:SuperpotentialExplicit} is always present in the superpotential. A realistic de Sitter vacuum can be achieved thanks to the presence of hidden matter on the D7-branes wrapping the ``big'' cycle of the swiss-cheese CY. It is also possible to get a de Sitter vacuum in a second way, by exploiting a perturbative effect taking place on top of a four-cycle invariant under the orientifold involution, but this setup requires a different CY manifold and a complete realization of the global embedding is still missing.

\part{Supersymmetry Breaking in Sequestered Models}
\label{part:SUSYBreaking}

\chapter{Sequestered de Sitter String Models: Soft-Terms}
\label{chap:Soft-Terms}

The simplest models of low-energy supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem are in tension with the latest LHC results (see e.g.~\cite{Craig:2013cxa} and references therein) which are moving the bounds for sparticle masses beyond the TeV scale. We are then either in a situation where we accept two to three orders of magnitude of tuning as still `natural', or we are at a very particular corner in the MSSM parameter space with less fine-tuning (e.g.~natural SUSY~\cite{Kitano:2005ew,Papucci:2011wy,Brust:2011tb}, compressed spectra~\cite{Lebedev:2005ge,LeCompte:2011cn}, RPV models~\cite{Allanach:2012vj,Evans:2012bf}), or we need alternatives to the conventional MSSM. Given this, there are various avenues to explore for addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The simplest MSSM models (e.g.~CMSSM) need to be modified at low energies to account for particular corners in the MSSM parameter space with reduced fine-tuning. Or, one step further, extensions of the MSSM including extra matter and/or interactions at the TeV scale may relax the tuning of the MSSM (see e.g.~\cite{Ross:2012nr}).
\item The MSSM is the correct description for beyond the Standard Model physics but the hierarchy problem is addressed by different amounts of fine-tuning through the multiverse just like the cosmological constant problem~\cite{Bousso:2000xa}, where we can distinguish the following classes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The simplest models of low-energy SUSY are realized with some two to three orders magnitude of fine-tuning.
\item One just keeps the appealing features of low-energy SUSY of realizing the correct DM density and gauge coupling unification whereas the hierarchy problem is no longer addressed. This proposal is commonly referred to as Split-SUSY~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2004fb} where gauginos are at the TeV scale while the scalar superpartners are hierarchically heavier.
\item DM and gauge coupling unification are achieved by other mechanisms and the SUSY particles are at a scale far above the electroweak scale such as an intermediate scale.
\end{enumerate}
\item One can consider alternative solutions to the hierarchy problem such as composite models or extra-dimensional models.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these scenarios has its own virtues and demerits. The first one aims at avoiding fine-tuning in the parameter space of the MSSM, but without a principle on why to favor a particular extension in a UV theory, it is in some sense a tuning in theory space which is as appealing as fine-tuning in parameter space, the others simply accept some sort of tuning.\footnote{Particular interesting corners of parameter space for soft-terms can be obtained by invoking principles such as precision gauge coupling unification~\cite{Krippendorf:2013dqa} or by identifying pattern in underlying UV theories (e.g.~realization of natural SUSY and compressed spectra in the Heterotic mini-landscape~\cite{Krippendorf:2012ir,Badziak:2012yg}).} Given this state of affairs, we are left with the unpleasant situation that at present the best argument in favor of low-energy SUSY is that other alternatives, like large extra-dimensions or composite models, are looking even worse.\\

This is a golden opportunity for string theoretical scenarios to play a role. Being the only explicit scenarios that provide a UV completion of the Standard Model, they should be able to address the problems of the scenarios mentioned above,
provide guidance towards their explicit realization and maybe even suggest other alternative avenues.\\

Consistent string theories are typically supersymmetric. Unfortunately, low-energy SUSY or the MSSM are not a prediction of string theory and its potential discovery or lack of will not directly test string theory. Moreover for a high string scale of order $10^{16}$~GeV (as hinted by standard MSSM gauge coupling unification), obtaining at the same time low-energy SUSY can be a challenge for model building. Another important feature is the string landscape which can potentially have an impact on the hierarchy problem. These are very important issues which can impact LHC and future collider observations. They need to be addressed systematically and within a complete string framework, as we do in one specific example in the present chapter.\\

Fortunately progress in the understanding of SUSY-breaking in string compactifications is maturing right on time to play a role. Several scenarios in which most of the string moduli have been stabilized with SUSY-breaking and computable soft-terms have emerged~\cite{Choi:2005ge,Nilles:1997cm,Conlon:2006us,Conlon:2006wz, Lowen:2008fm, deAlwis:2009fn, Cicoli:2013rwa,Acharya:2008zi}. Some of them are also consistent with cosmological constraints such as the CMP and the realization of de Sitter (dS) vacua. In particular, the LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS)~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}, on which we focus, allows for several of the above SUSY-breaking scenarios in which soft-terms can be explicitly computed. Moreover, LVS is an ideal framework to build globally consistent MSSM-like chiral models for explicit CY compactifications with all closed string moduli stabilized~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg,Cicoli:2013mpa,Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2013cha}. It is also possible to obtain dS vacua from supersymmetric effective actions~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2012fh} and the string landscape allows for a controllable fine-tuning of the cosmological constant and potentially the electroweak hierarchy problem.\\

In this chapter our focus shall be on sequestered models, in order to explore the possibility of getting low-energy SUSY from string compactifications. In~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} it was realized that soft-terms can potentially be sensitive to the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS minimum. Lack of a controlled understanding of the way to get dS vacua made it difficult to present a complete analysis of the SUSY phenomenology. Recently there has been progress in obtaining dS vacua from supersymmetric effective actions~\cite{Cicoli:2013mpa, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2012fh, Cicoli:2013cha,Krippendorf:2009zza}. In this chapter we work out this dependence on the uplifting mechanism in sequestered models. As previously, we assume an MSSM spectrum from the local D-branes configuration for simplicity.\\

We explicitly compute all soft-terms for sequestered scenarios identifying different cases depending on the mechanism to obtain dS vacua and the moduli-dependence of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields. Broadly, we find two classes of models: scenarios in which all soft-terms are of order $m_{3/2}/\mathcal{V}$ and scenarios where gaugino masses and A-terms are of this order but scalar masses are of order $m_{3/2}/\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$. In both cases the numerical coefficients of the soft-terms are determined by background fluxes and therefore can be tuned by scanning through the landscape. This provides an explicit mechanism for the (small) tuning that might be necessary to confront LHC data. In the first class of models the spectrum is similar to standard MSSM spectra with soft-terms of the same order but with the potential of extra non-universal flux-dependent contribution. The second one gives a universal Mini-Split scenario with negligible non-universalities.\\

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Sec.~\ref{sec:SeqLVS} contains the detailed setup that leads to sequestered LVS models and a presentation of two mechanisms to obtain dS vacua. We then compute the leading order expressions of the associated F-terms and soft-masses for these scenarios in Sec.~\ref{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses}. Finally in Sec.~\ref{sec:DesequesteringSources} we comment on possible sources of desequestering before concluding in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}. This chapter is based on~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}.

\section{Sequestered LVS Scenarios}
\label{sec:SeqLVS}

After having introduced many ingredients needed to build a phenomenologically viable compactification, let us summarize a setup in Type IIB CY flux compactifications with O3/O7-planes that leads to dS moduli stabilization
\`a la LVS and a visible sector sequestered from SUSY-breaking:
\begin{itemize}
\item The simplest LVS vacua can be obtained for a CY with negative Euler number and at least one blow-up
of a point-like singularity~\cite{Cicoli:2008va}, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:LVS}. For these manifolds the volume~$\mathcal{V}$ is of swiss-cheese type as in eq. \eqref{eq:VolumeLVS}. In the explicit case of Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel} the intersection numbers are given in eq. \eqref{eq:VolumeExplicitCY}, but the results of this chapter are independent of the particular values of $\alpha_i$.\footnote{It is possible to implement LVS in CYs which have a more general volume form~\cite{Cicoli:2008va} but this does not alter the structure of soft-masses and so we do not consider these cases.}
\item The visible sector can be realized with appropriate D-branes configurations on blow-up moduli. Concrete D-branes realizations with D3/D7 branes at del Pezzo singularities can lead to interesting gauge/matter extensions of the MSSM. As qualitatively discussed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:D3atSingularities} the size of the associated four-cycle can shrink to zero value due to D-terms stabilization. Because of this shrinking, the F-term of the corresponding blow-up K\"ahler modulus is vanishing at leading order giving rise to a sequestered scenario. We report all the details of this mechanism in Sec.~\ref{sssec:Shrinking}  In order to get the maximal degree of sequestering, in this thesis we consider D3-branes at singularities constructions without D7 flavour branes.
\item In order to realize a dS vacuum one introduces further ingredients in the compactification. Here we concentrate on two options:
(i) Hidden sector matter fields on the large cycle which acquire non-zero F-terms because of D-terms fixing~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}; (ii) E(-1) instantons at a second singularity whose blow-up mode develops non-vanishing F-term due to new dilaton-dependent non-perturbative effects~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. These mechanisms will be discussed respectively in Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift} and in Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift}.
\end{itemize}
The setup with de Sitter scenario arising from matter fields on the large cycle has been realized in concrete CY orientifold compactifications with D3(/D7) branes at singularities~\cite{Cicoli:2013mpa,Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2013cha} that satisfy all global consistency conditions (e.g.~tadpole cancellation), as reported in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}.\\ 

The minimal setup that allows this realization includes at least four K\"ahler moduli: a `big' four-cycle $T_b$ controlling the size of the CY volume, a `small' blow up mode $T_s$ supporting non-perturbative effects, the visible sector cycle $T_\SM$ and its orientifold image $G$. These last two moduli are associated to two del Pezzo divisors which collapse to zero size due to D-terms fixing\footnote{The positivity of soft scalar masses for visible sector fields fixes all remaining flat-directions after D-terms stabilization~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}.} and are exchanged by the orientifold involution. This setup leads to $h^{(1,1)}_+ = 3$ and $h^{(1,1)}_- = 1$ with the K\"ahler moduli already reported in eq. \eqref{eq:KahlerModuliPaper}.

\subsection*{${\cal N} = 1$ Supergravity Effective Field Theory}

In this section we briefly review the low-energy effective action relevant for our construction in the language of 4D ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity, that we have already studied in Sec. \ref{chap:Compactifications&ModelBuilding}. We write the expressions in such a way that a couple of alternative scenarios for de Sitter sectors are included, the first one of which has already a fully consistent global embedding \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} as explained in Sec. \ref{ssec:ExplicitGlobalModel}. Including de Sitter and matter contributions, the superpotential takes the following form
\begin{align}
W= W_0(U,S) + A_s(U, S)\, e^{- a_s T_s} +  W_\dS+W_{\rm matter}\,.
\label{eq:FullSuperpotential}
\end{align}
As explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:CorrectionsToTreeLevel}, the pre-factor $A_s(U,S)$ depends on both complex structure moduli $U$ and the dilaton $S$, and it is an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function.\footnote{The dependence on $S$ and $U$-moduli is structurally different, i.e.~the dependence on the dilaton is generated when including the back-reaction of sources and warping on the geometry~\cite{Baumann:2006th}.} The term $W_\dS$ involves the contribution from the mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum (see Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios}) while $W_{\rm matter}$ is the visible sector superpotential
\begin{align}
W_{\rm matter} = \mu(M) H_u H_d + \frac 16 Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(M) C^\alpha C^\beta C^\gamma + \cdots\,,
\label{Wmatter}
\end{align}
where we denoted the moduli as $M$ and the MSSM superfields as $C^\alpha$. Moreover, the dots refer to higher dimensional operators. We also separated the two higgs doublets $H_u$ and $H_d$ from the rest of matter fields in the moduli-dependent $\mu$-term. Because of the holomorphicity of $W$ and the perturbative shift-symmetry of the axionic components of the K\"ahler moduli, the Yukawa couplings and the $\mu$-term can depend only on $S$ and $U$ at the perturbative level with the $T$-moduli appearing only non-perturbatively. We discuss this dependence in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses} and ~\ref{sec:DesequesteringSources}.\\

For the reasons explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:D3atSingularities}~\cite{Conlon:2008wa,Blumenhagen:2009gk}, we assume the following form of the K\"ahler potential which describes the regime for the visible sector near the singularity
\begin{align}
\label{generalk}
K = - 2 \ln\left(\mathcal{V} + \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\right) - \ln(2s) + \lambda_\SM \frac{\tau_\SM^2}{\mathcal{V}} + \lambda_b \frac{b^2}{\mathcal{V}} + K_\dS + K_{\rm cs}(U) + K_{\rm matter}\, ,
\end{align}
where $\hat\xi\equiv \xi s^{3/2}$, the $\lambda$'s are ${O}(1)$ coefficients, $K_{\rm cs}(U)$ is the tree-level K\"ahler potential for complex structure moduli and $K_\dS$ encodes the dependence on the sector responsible for obtaining a dS vacuum (see Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios}). The matter K\"ahler potential $K_{\rm matter}$ is taken to be
\begin{align}
K_{\rm matter} = \tilde{K}_{\alpha}(M, \overline{M}) \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} C^{\alpha} + [Z(M, \overline{M}) H_u H_d + \text{h.c.}]\,.
\label{mm}
\end{align}
We assume at this stage that the matter metric is flavour diagonal beyond the leading order structure which was highlighted in~\cite{Conlon:2007dw}.\footnote{Sub-leading flavour off-diagonal entries which can in principle appear~\cite{Camara:2013fta} are taken to be absent. This is motivated by the appearance of additional anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries in D-branes models, in particular also in the context of del Pezzo singularities~\cite{Dolan:2011qu}.} The only exception is that we allow for the higgs bilinear to appear in $K_{\rm matter}$ which we parametrize with the function $Z$. Note that $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ is the matter metric for the visible sector which we will parametrize as~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}
\begin{align}
\tilde{K}_{\alpha} = \frac{f_\alpha(U,S)}{\mathcal{V}^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat\xi}{\mathcal{V}}
+ \tilde{K}_\dS + c_\SM \tau_\SM^p + c_b b^p\right), \qquad p > 0\,,
\label{mattermetric}
\end{align}
where we have used $\tilde{K}_\dS$ to parametrize the dependence on the dS mechanism (details will be given in Sec.~\ref{soft}). The $c$'s are taken as constants for simplicity while $p$ is taken to be positive in order to have a well-behaved metric in the singular limit $b,\tau_\SM \to 0$. As they can in principle depend on $U$ and $S$, we comment in due course on the influence on the soft-terms of such a dependence. The appearance of the higgs bilinear and its potential parametrization are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:SoftTerms} when we analyze the $\mu$-term in this scenario. In general the functions $f_\alpha(U,S)$ could be non-universal. Such non-universality can have interesting phenomenological implications (e.g.~mass hierarchies among families of sfermion masses needed for a realization of natural SUSY). As we are interested in soft-terms arising for D-branes at singularities, we take the gauge kinetic function to be
\begin{align}
f_a=\delta_a S+ \kappa_a \,T_\SM\, ,
\label{eq:gaugekineticf}
\end{align}
where $\delta_a$ are universal constants for $\mathbb{Z}_n$ singularities but can be non-universal for more general singularities.\\

\subsection{Moduli Stabilization}

As outlined earlier in this section, we stabilize the moduli following the LVS procedure. The complex structure moduli and the dilaton are fixed at tree-level by background fluxes while the K\"ahler moduli are fixed using higher order corrections to the effective action~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}. In this section we first explain the D-terms stabilization in detail, and then we perform the F-terms stabilization taking into account both the effects coming from the de Sitter sector, and the small shift of the supersymmetric minimum $D_S W_0 = D_{U^a} W_0 = 0$ due to non-perturbative and $\alpha'$-corrections which induces a non-vanishing IASD component of the three-form flux $G_3$.

\subsubsection{D-terms Stabilization}
\label{sssec:Shrinking}

The K\"ahler moduli where the visible sector D-branes configuration is located are stabilized using D-terms which are the leading order contribution to the potential. Remaining flat directions are stabilized using sub-leading F-terms contributions. To set the notation, let us review D-terms stabilization~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. The moduli $T_\SM$ and $G$ are charged under two anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$. The corresponding D-terms potential reads
\begin{align}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_1)} \left(\sum_\alpha q_{1 \alpha} \frac{\partial K}{\partial C^\alpha} C^\alpha - \xi_1\right)^2
+ \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_2)} \left(\sum_\alpha q_{2 \alpha} \frac{\partial K}{\partial C^\alpha} C^\alpha - \xi_2\right)^2\,,
\label{dtermpot}
\end{align}
where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the gauge kinetic functions of the two $U(1)$s.
The Fayet-Iliopoulos~(FI) terms are given by (see appendix of~\cite{Cicoli:2011yh} for the exact numerical factors)
\begin{align}
\xi_1 &= - \frac{q_1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_\SM} = - \frac{q_1  \lambda_\SM}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\SM}{\mathcal{V}}\,, \label{xiSM} \\
&\xi_2 = - \frac{q_2}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial G} = - \frac{q_2 \lambda_b}{4\pi} \frac{b}{\mathcal{V}}\,.
\end{align}
The vanishing D-terms condition fixes therefore $a_\SM$ and $b$ in terms of visible sector matter fields.
The remaining flat directions are fixed by sub-leading F-terms contributions which give vanishing VEVs to the $C^\alpha$ if they develop non-tachyonic soft masses from SUSY-breaking~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}.\footnote{If the soft scalar masses of some $C^\alpha$ are tachyonic, they develop non-zero VEVs (which could be phenomenologically allowed for some Standard Model singlets) that, in turn, induce non-zero FI-terms~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}. However $\tau_\SM$ and $b$ would still be fixed in the singular regime since their VEVs would be volume-suppressed~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.} Hence the D-terms potential \eqref{dtermpot} vanishes in the vacuum since it is fixed to a supersymmetric minimum at $\xi_1 = \xi_2 = 0$. This corresponds to the singular limit $\tau_\SM = b = 0$. In turn, the axions $a_\SM$ and $c$ are eaten up by the two $U(1)$ gauge bosons in the process of anomaly cancellation.

\subsubsection{F-terms Stabilization}

F-terms stabilization proceeds as explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:LVS}. The de Sitter sector generates a correction to the minimum in eq. \eqref{eq:TausMinimum}
\begin{align}
\tau_s^{3/2} = \frac{\hat\xi}{2} \left[1 + f_\dS(\epsilon_s) \right]\,,
\label{eq:TausMinimumCorrected}
\end{align}
where $f_\dS$ is a sub-dominant function of $\epsilon_s = \frac{1}{4 a_s \tau_s}$ which depends on the particular mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum, as reported below. The relation \eqref{eq:TausMinimumCorrected} implies that at the minimum (neglecting $f_\dS$)
\begin{align}
\hat\xi\simeq \frac{1}{4\left(a_s \epsilon_s\right)^{3/2}}\sim{O}\left[\left(\ln\mathcal{V}\right)^{3/2}\right] \gg 1\,.
\label{tausms2}
\end{align}
Given that the potential (\ref{eq:LVSScalarPotential}) depends on $S$ and $U$ (via $A_s(U,S)$ and $s$-dependent $\alpha'$ effects), the minimum (\ref{susyminim}) is slightly shifted from its supersymmetric locus. This shift is fundamental for the soft-term computation in sequestered scenarios since non-vanishing F-terms of $U$ and $S$ at sub-leading order can actually provide the main contribution to soft-terms~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}.

\subsubsection{Shift in the Minimum}
\label{shiftsection}

Let us try to estimate the shift of $S$ and $U$ from their supersymmetric minimum (\ref{susyminim}) because of $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects. The K\"ahler covariant derivative of the total superpotential evaluated at the minimum (\ref{eq:TaubMinimum}) and (\ref{eq:TausMinimumCorrected}) reads (we neglect ${O}(\epsilon_s)$ effects)
\begin{align}
D_S W \simeq \left.D_S W_0\right|_{\xi = 0} - \frac{3\hat\xi W_0}{4s\mathcal{V}}
\left[1 + \epsilon_s s\partial_s \ln A_s(U,S)\right]\,.
\end{align}
Since we do not know the functional dependence of $A_s(U,S)$ and since the $W_\dS$ term in eq. \eqref{eq:FullSuperpotential} can also potentially shift the dilaton minimum, it is not possible for us to compute this shift explicitly. We will parametrize it by using the parameter $\omega_S(U,S)$ defined as
\begin{align}
\label{dilmin}
D_S W = - \frac{3 \omega_S(U,S)}{4} \frac{\hat\xi W_0}{s\mathcal{V}}\,.
\end{align}
The dependence of $A_s(U, S)$ on the complex structure moduli is also responsible for shifting the $U$-moduli
from their supersymmetric minimum. After imposing the minimization conditions, the total $D_{U^a} W$ looks like (denoting $u\equiv {\rm Re}(U)$)
\begin{align}
D_{U^a} W \simeq \left.D_{U^a} W_0\right|_{\xi = 0} - \frac{3\hat\xi W_0}{4\mathcal{V}}
\epsilon_s \partial_u\left[K_{\rm cs}(U)+  \ln A_s(U,S)\right]\,,
\end{align}
and so we can parametrize this shift by $\omega_{U^a}(U,S)$ as
\begin{align}
\label{csmin}
D_{U^a} W = - \frac{3 \omega_{U^a} (U,S)}{4} \frac{\hat\xi W_0}{s\mathcal{V}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad D_{U^a} W =\frac{\omega_{U^a} (U,S)}{\omega_S(U,S)} D_S W\sim {O}(\mathcal{V}^{-1})\,,
\end{align}
where both $\omega_S$ and $\omega_{U^a}$ are expected to be ${O}(1)$ functions of $S$ and $U$. Note that both functions $\omega_{S/U^a}$ depend also on the dS mechanism. These corrections give rise to $\mathcal{O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$ contributions to the scalar potential, and then as already mentioned the EFT is self-consistent. They generate a non-vanishing IASD and $G_3^{(0,3)}$ components of the three-form flux $G_3$, which can be seen as small perturbations around the supersymmetric background.

\subsection{Scenarios for de Sitter Vacua}
\label{ssec:deSitterScenarios}

In this section we review two mechanisms which can lead to dS vacua in LVS.

\subsubsection{Case 1: dS Vacua from Hidden Matter Fields}
\label{sssec:MatterUplift}

In the LVS setting, dS vacua can arise if some hidden matter fields acquire non-vanishing F-terms which provide a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. The models constructed in~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw} provide globally consistent explicit examples of string models with a semi-realistic visible sector, moduli stabilization and a positive cosmological constant (see Fig.~\ref{Fig1} for a pictorial sketch of this setup).\\

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{Images/hiddenmatterink.pdf}
\caption{Pictorial sketch of our CY setup for dS vacua from hidden matter fields.} \label{Fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Generically, the choice of $B_2$ which cancels the Freed-Witten anomaly on the small cycle $T_s$, leads to non-vanishing gauge fluxes on the big cycle $T_b$. As a consequence, $T_b$ acquires a non-zero $U(1)$-charge $q_b$
generating a moduli-dependent FI-term. The D-terms potential becomes (focusing for simplicity on a single matter field $\phi_\dS$ with K\"ahler metric $K_\dS= s^{-1}|\phi_\dS|^2$~\cite{Conlon:2006tj, Aparicio:2008wh} and $U(1)$-charge $q_\phi$)
\begin{align}
\label{dmatter}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_b)} \left(\frac{q_\phi}{s} |\phi_\dS|^2 - \xi_b\right)^2\,,
\end{align}
where $f_b = T_b$ (neglecting $S$-dependent flux corrections) and the FI-term is given by
\begin{align}
\xi_b = - \frac{q_b}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_b} = \frac{3 q_b}{8\pi}\frac{1}{\mathcal{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{align}
Therefore the total scalar potential takes the form
\begin{align}
V_{\rm tot} = V_D + V_F =  \frac{1}{2\mathcal{V}^{2/3}} \left(\frac{q_\phi}{s}  |\phi_\dS|^2 - \frac{3 q_b}{8\pi\mathcal{V}^{2/3}}\right)^2
+ \frac{1}{s} m_{3/2}^2 |\phi_\dS|^2 + V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{Vtot}
\end{align}
where $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass as in eq.~(\ref{m32}) and $V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}$ is given in (\ref{eq:LVSScalarPotential}). If the two $U(1)$-charges $q_\phi$ and $q_b$ have the same sign, $\phi_\dS$ develops a non-vanishing VEV
\begin{align}
\label{minphi}
\frac{q_\phi}{s} |\phi_\dS|^2 = \xi_b - \frac{m_{3/2}^2 \mathcal{V}^{2/3}}{q_\phi}\,.
\end{align}
Substituting this VEV in (\ref{Vtot}) we obtain
\begin{align}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{D,0}+\frac{3 q_b}{16\pi q_\phi} \frac{W_0^2}{s  \mathcal{V}^{8/3}}+V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{VTOT}
\end{align}
where the new positive contribution can lead to an LVS dS vacuum while the D-terms potential gives rise only to a sub-leading effect of order
\begin{align}
V_{D,0} = \frac{m_{3/2}^4 \mathcal{V}^{2/3}}{2 q_\phi^2}\sim {O}\left(\mathcal{V}^{-10/3}\right)\,.
\label{VD0ds1}
\end{align}
Following~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}, we can minimize the total scalar potential (\ref{VTOT}) with respect to $\tau_s$ and $\mathcal{V}$, finding the following value of the vacuum energy (neglecting the sub-leading effect of $V_{D,0}$)
\begin{align}
\langle V_{\rm tot} \rangle \simeq \frac{3 W_0^2}{8s a_s^{3/2}\langle\mathcal{V}\rangle^3}\left[\delta\, \mathcal{V}^{1/3}
-\sqrt{\ln\left(\frac{\langle\mathcal{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)}\right]\,,
\label{VTOTfin}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\delta = \frac{1}{18\pi}\frac{q_b\,a_s^{3/2}}{q_\phi} \simeq 0.02 \left(\frac{q_b\,a_s^{3/2}}{q_\phi}\right)\,.
\end{align}
A cancellation of the vacuum energy at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$ requires therefore to tune $W_0$ so that
(a sub-leading tuning is needed to cancel also $V_{D,0}$)
\begin{align}
\left[\ln\left(\frac{\langle\mathcal{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)\right]^{3/2}= \delta^3\, \langle\mathcal{V}\rangle \sim 5\cdot 10^{-6}\, \langle\mathcal{V}\rangle\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
|\phi_\dS|^2 = \frac{27 s}{4 a_s^{3/2}\mathcal{V}}\sqrt{\ln\left(\frac{\langle\mathcal{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)}\sim \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}\sqrt{\epsilon_s}}\,.
\label{CCconddS1}
\end{align}
For natural ${O}(1)$ values of all underlying parameters, this relation gives a minimum for $\mathcal{V}$ at order $10^6 - 10^7$ (see~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}). In~\cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} the authors showed that this de Sitter scenario can be generically obtained in presence of D7-branes with non-zero gauge flux, which lead to a T-brane configuration~\cite{Cecotti:2010bp}. Expanding the D7-branes action around the T-brane background gives a positive definite term in the scalar potential, which can be used to get a de Sitter vacuum.

\subsubsection{Case 2: dS Vacua from Non-perturbative Effects at Singularities}
\label{sssec:DilatonUplift}

Reference~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh} provided a novel method for obtaining LVS dS vacua (see Fig.~\ref{Fig2} for a pictorial sketch of this setup).
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Images/dilatonink.pdf}
\caption{Pictorial view of our CY setup for dS vacua from non-perturbative effects at singularities.} \label{Fig2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The additional contribution to the scalar potential needed to achieve a positive cosmological constant arises
from non-perturbative effects at singularities (like gaugino condensation on space-time filling D3-branes or E(-1) instantons). These effects generate a new contribution to the superpotential in eq. \eqref{eq:FullSuperpotential} of the form
\begin{align}
W_\dS = A_\dS(U, S) \,e^{-a_\dS (S + \kappa_\dS T_\dS)}\,.
\label{Wds2}
\end{align}
Because of the presence of an additional K\"ahler modulus, the K\"ahler potential (\ref{generalk}) has to be supplemented with
\begin{align}
\label{dk2}
K_\dS =  \lambda_\dS\frac{\tau_\dS^2}{\mathcal{V}}\,,
\end{align}
with $\tau_\dS={\rm Re}(T_\dS)$. This blow-up mode can be fixed in the singular regime by minimizing the hidden sector D-terms potential (focusing for simplicity on canonically normalized hidden fields $\phi_{{\rm h},i}$ with charges $q_{{\rm h},i}$ under an anomalous $U(1)$)
\begin{align}
\label{DtermPot1}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_{\rm h})} \left(\sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2 - \xi_{\rm h}\right)^2\,,
\end{align}
where $f_{\rm h} = S$ (neglecting $T_\dS$-dependent corrections) and the FI-term is given by
($q_\dS$ is the $U(1)$-charge of $T_\dS$ and from now on we set $\lambda_\dS=1$ for simplicity)
\begin{align}
\xi_{\rm h} = - \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_\dS} = - \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{\mathcal{V}}\,.
\end{align}
In fact, the total scalar potential takes the leading order form (after fixing the axionic phase of $T_\dS$)~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh}
\begin{align}
V_{\rm tot} = \frac{1}{2s} \left(\sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2 + \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{\mathcal{V}}\right)^2
+ \frac{\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^2}{s}\frac{e^{-2 a_\dS \left(s+\kappa_\dS\tau_\dS\right)}}{\mathcal{V}} + V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{Vtot1}
\end{align}
where the second term comes from the new superpotential (\ref{Wds2}) and $V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}$ is given in~(\ref{eq:LVSScalarPotential}). Minimization with respect to $\tau_\dS$ gives
\begin{align}
\frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{\mathcal{V}}=- \sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2
+ \frac{a_\dS \kappa_\dS}{q_\dS}\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^2 e^{-2 a_\dS s}\,.
\label{tdsVEV}
\end{align}
Assuming that model-dependent contributions from F-terms of hidden matter fields fix some $\phi_{{\rm h}, i}$ at non-zero VEVs such that $\langle\sum_i q_{{\rm hid},i} |\phi_{{\rm hid},i}|^2\rangle = 0$ but $A_\dS\neq 0$,\footnote{In order to make $W_\dS$ gauge invariant, $A_\dS$ has to depend on the $\phi_{{\rm h},i}$ which can develop non-zero VEVs for appropriate hidden field F-terms contributions, giving $A_\dS\neq 0$ with $\tau_\dS$ in the singular regime~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh}.} and substituting the VEV (\ref{tdsVEV}) in (\ref{Vtot1}) we obtain at leading order
\begin{align}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{D,0}+ \frac{(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS)^2}{s} \frac{e^{-2 a_\dS s}}{\mathcal{V}} + V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}\,.
\end{align}
Given that the dilaton is fixed by a ratio of flux quanta, the extra positive definite contribution can easily be tuned to obtain a dS minimum. Following~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh}, a cancellation of the vacuum energy at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$ requires to tune three-form fluxes such that
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS}{W_0}\right)^2 \,e^{-2 a_\dS s}
= \frac{9}{32} \frac{\epsilon_s \hat\xi}{\mathcal{V}^2}\,.
\label{CCconddS2}
\end{align}
On the other hand, the D-terms potential gives rise only to a sub-leading effect of order
\begin{align}
V_{D,0} =\frac{1}{2s} \left(\frac{a_\dS \kappa_\dS}{q_\dS}\right)^2\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^4 e^{-4 a_\dS s}\sim {O}\left(\mathcal{V}^{-4}\right)\,.
\label{VD0ds2}
\end{align}

\section{F-terms and Soft-terms}
\label{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses}

In this section we list the leading order contributions to the F-terms relevant for the computation of all soft-terms, and we also report the sub-leading corrections to the F-terms in a subsection. After defining our parametrization for the K\"ahler matter metric in local and ultra-local scenarios, we then calculate the soft-terms.

\subsection{Summary of F-terms}
\label{fterms}

The general supergravity expression for an F-term is~\cite{Kaplunovsky:1993rd, Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{align}
F^I = e^{K/2} K^{I \overline{J}} D_{\overline{J}} \overline{W}\,.
\end{align}
The exact expressions for the F-terms are rather complicated. Considerable simplifications occur if we perform an expansion in $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$. We also factor out the gravitino mass which is given by the following expression
\begin{align}
m_{3/2}=e^{K/2} |W|= \frac{g_s^{1/2} M_{\rm P}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}\,\frac{W_0}{\mathcal{V}} \left[ 1-\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2\mathcal{V}}
\left(1+3 y_\dS \epsilon_s+{O}(\epsilon_s^2)\right)+{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{V}^2}\right)\right]\,,
\label{expandm32}
\end{align}
where $y_\dS =1$ for the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift} while $y_\dS = 1+\frac{\sqrt{2} a_s^{3/4}}{\kappa_\dS a_\dS}$ for the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift}. The leading order F-terms for $T_b$ and $T_s$ turn out to be
\begin{align}
\frac{F^{T_b}}{\tau_b} \simeq - 2 m_{3/2} \left(1+\frac{x_\dS}{a_s^{3/2} \mathcal{V}\sqrt{\epsilon_s}}\right)\,,
\qquad
\frac{F^{T_s}}{\tau_s} \simeq - 6   m_{3/2} \epsilon_s\,,
\label{FTb}
\end{align}
where $x_\dS = - 45/16$ for the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift} while $x_\dS \sim {O}(1/\mathcal{V})$ for the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift}, as reported below. Because of the shift from their supersymmetric minimum, also $S$ and $U$ develop non-vanishing F-terms whose leading order
expressions are
\begin{align}
\label{ds}
\frac{F^S}{s} \simeq \frac{3 \omega'_S(U,S) }{8 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{\mathcal{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}\,, \qquad
F^{U^a} \simeq - \frac{K^{U^a \overline{U}^{\overline{b}}}}{2 s^2}\frac{\omega_{\overline{U}^{\overline{b}}}(U,S)}{\omega'_S(U,S)}F^S\equiv \beta^{U^a}(U,S)F^S\,,
\end{align}
where $\omega'_S(U,S) \equiv 3 - 2 \omega_S(U,S)$ with $\omega_S$ as defined in (\ref{dilmin}) and $\beta^{U^a}$ are unknown ${O}(1)$ functions of $U$ and $S$. Additional non-zero F-terms are associated to fields responsible for achieving a dS solution. For the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift} there is an F-term associated to $\phi_\dS$
\begin{align}
\frac{F^{\phi_\dS}}{\phi_\dS} \simeq m_{3/2}\,,
\end{align}
with $\phi_\dS$ given in (\ref{CCconddS1}) (up to an irrelevant phase). On the other hand, in the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift} the blow-up mode $T_\dS$ has a non-vanishing F-term (using the condition (\ref{CCconddS2}))
\begin{align}
F^{T_\dS} \simeq \frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}a_s^{3/4}}\frac{m_{3/2}}{\epsilon_s^{1/4}} \,.
\end{align}
Finally, the F-terms associated to the MSSM cycles $T_\SM$ and $G$ vanish:
\begin{align}
F^G = F^{T_\SM} = 0\, .
\end{align}
This result is crucial for sequestering since the dominant F-terms are then associated with moduli which couple weakly to the visible sector via Planck-suppressed interactions.\footnote{$T_\SM$ and $G$ can develop non-zero F-terms only in the presence of tachyonic scalar masses~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}. However, also in this case, their contribution to soft-terms turns out to be negligible.}

\subsubsection{Sub-leading Corrections to F-terms}
\label{sssec:SubleadingCorrectionsToFTerms}

In the present section we first describe the shift of the LVS minimum after including an extra term responsible to achieve a dS vacuum, and then provide sub-leading corrections to F-terms. As described in Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios}, the mechanism which realizes a dS vacuum gives rise effectively to an extra term of the form
\begin{align}
V_\dS=\frac{r}{\mathcal{V}^m}\qquad\text{with}\quad r>0\quad\text{and}\quad m<3\,.
\end{align}
We are interested in minimizing the combined system
\begin{align}
V=V_{{O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})}+V_\dS\,,
\end{align}
with the additional constraint of vanishing vacuum energy. This constraint relates the coefficient $r$ with the tunable flux parameters in the LVS potential such as $W_0$ or $g_s$. A concrete dS scenario, such as the ones in Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios}, typically fixes $r$ by construction with only moderate tuning. However the real tuning can be achieved by simply tuning the flux superpotential and the string coupling in agreement with the flux landscape.\\

The expressions for the moduli VEVs are largely independent on the way to get dS vacua. In fact, the relation (\ref{eq:TaubMinimum}) is generic whereas the expression (\ref{eq:TausMinimumCorrected}) for the VEV of $\tau_s$ depends on the way to get a dS vacuum only at sub-leading order. The exact minimum for $\tau_s$ is given by
\begin{align}
\tau_s^{3/2}=\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\, \frac{(1-\epsilon_s)^2}{(1-4\epsilon_s)}\, \frac{1}{1+\frac{2m}{m-3} \epsilon_s}
=\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\left[1+f_\dS(\epsilon_s)\right]\,,
\label{eq:shiftds}
\end{align}
and so the function $f_\dS$ is $f_\dS= 18 \epsilon_s+297 \epsilon_s^2$ in the case of dS vacua from hidden matter fields ($m=8/3$),
while $f_\dS=3 \epsilon_s+12 \epsilon_s^2$ for the case of non-perturbative effects at singularities ($m=1$).
Note that as a consequence of the shift in $\tau_s$, also the overall volume in (\ref{eq:TaubMinimum}) is shifted and, as the shift is in the exponential, this shift can be parametrically large.\\

Equipped with the minimum, we can evaluate the F-terms. To simplify the notation we factor out an overall factor of the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ which is given by (\ref{expandm32}). The F-terms turn out to have the following expressions:
\begin{align}
\frac{F^{T_b}}{\tau_b}&=-2 m_{3/2}\left[1+\frac{9 \hat{\xi} \epsilon_s}{4 \mathcal{V}} \frac{m-1}{m-3+2m\epsilon_s} +{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{V}^2}\right)\right]\,, \\
\frac{F^{T_s}}{\tau_s}&= -2 m_{3/2}\left[\frac{3\epsilon_s}{(1-\epsilon_s)}-\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2\mathcal{V}}
\left(1-\frac{9\epsilon_s}{2}\frac{m-1}{m-3}+{O}\left(\epsilon_s^2\right)\right)\right]\,, \\
\frac{F^S}{s}&= \frac{3 \omega'_S }{8 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{\mathcal{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}\left[1+{O}\left(\epsilon_s\right)\right]\,, \\
F^U&= - \frac{K^{U^a \overline{U}_{\overline{b}}}}{2 s^2}\frac{\omega_{\overline{U}_{\overline{b}}}}{\omega'_S}F^S\equiv \beta^{U^a}\,F^S\,, \\
F^{\phi_\dS} &= \phi_\dS m_{3/2}\left[1+ {O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{V}}\right)\right] \,, \\
F^{T_{\dS}}&= \frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}a_s^{3/4}}\frac{m_{3/2}}{\epsilon_s^{1/4}}\left[1+{O}\left(\epsilon_s\right)\right]\,.
\end{align}

\subsection{Local and Ultra-local Scenarios}
\label{soft}

Our analysis of soft-terms will distinguish between two classes of models: local and ultra-local. This classification is motivated by locality arguments already discussed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:D3atSingularities}: the \Kahler matter metric should scale as $\tilde{K}_\alpha \sim  {V}^{-2/3}$ at leading order. In the present section we expand the constraint on the \Kahler matter metric coming from the structure of physical Yukawa couplings in eq. \eqref{eq:HolomorphicYukawaCoupling} at sub-leading order, and we get (for $\tau_\SM = b= C^\alpha= 0$)
\begin{align}
\label{ul}
\tilde{K}_\alpha = h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K/3} \simeq  \frac{h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}\mathcal{V}^{2/3}} \left(1- \frac{\hat\xi}{3\mathcal{V}}  + \frac 13 K_\dS\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $h_\alpha(U,S)$ is an unknown function of $U$ and $S$ and in the approximation we focus on the first sub-leading order corrections, e.g.~neglecting higher order corrections of ${O}\left(1/\mathcal{V}^{8/3}\right)$. Note that this result has the same volume scaling of our formula for the matter metric (\ref{mattermetric}) which for $\tau_\SM = b= 0$ reduces to
\begin{align}
\tilde{K}_{\alpha} = \frac{f_\alpha(U,S)}{\mathcal{V}^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat\xi}{\mathcal{V}}
+ \tilde{K}_\dS\right)\equiv f_\alpha(U,S)\tilde{K}\,.
\label{newKtilde}
\end{align}
As found in~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}, our soft-terms computation is sensitive to the form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha-$
beyond leading order in a $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ expansion. There is no reason to expect that (\ref{ul}) still holds beyond leading order since we cannot use locality to fix the form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ (although there is some evidence from perturbative string computations~\cite{Conlon:2011jq}). It was noted in~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} that the relation (\ref{ul}) has interesting implications for the soft-terms. Guided by this, we organize our analysis of models into two classes of phenomenological models:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Local}: We call a scenario `local' if (\ref{ul}) holds only to leading order in $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$;
\item {\it Ultra-local}: We call a scenario `ultra-local' if (\ref{ul}) holds exactly.
\end{itemize}
If we parametrize $\tilde{K}_\dS$ as $\tilde{K}_\dS  =  c_\dS K_\dS$,
comparing (\ref{ul}) with (\ref{newKtilde}), we find that in the ultra-local case
\begin{align}
f_{\alpha}(U,S) = \frac{h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}}\qquad \text{and}\qquad c_s=c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\label{fdef}
\end{align}
Subleading deviations from the approximation in~(\ref{ul}) can be accounted for by small changes in $c_s$ and $c_\dS$ at the appropriate sub-leading order.

\subsection{Soft-terms}
\label{sssec:SoftTerms}

We now proceed to compute all soft-terms distinguishing between ultra-local and local scenarios. Throughout this section we work to leading order in $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gaugino masses}\\

The general expression for gaugino masses in gravity mediation is
\begin{align}
\label{gauginomass}
M_a = \frac{1}{2 {\rm Re}\left(f_a\right)} F^I \partial_I f_a\, ,
\end{align}
where $f_a=\delta_a S+ \kappa_a \,T_\SM$ is the gauge kinetic function as in~\eqref{eq:gaugekineticf}. As $F^{T_\SM}=0$, we obtain universal gaugino masses, $M_1=M_2=M_3=M_{1/2}$, which are generated by the dilaton F-term. Potential non-universalities can arise through anomaly mediated contributions which turn out to be sub-leading (see Sec.~\ref{sec:DesequesteringSources} for more details). The leading order expression for the gaugino masses is
\begin{align}
M_{1/2} = \frac{F^S}{2 s} \simeq \frac{3 \omega'_S(U,S)}{16 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{\mathcal{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}
\sim {O}\left(m_{3/2}\frac{\left(\ln\mathcal{V}\right)^{3/2}}{\mathcal{V}}\right)\ll m_{3/2}\,.
\label{ggmm}
\end{align}
Note that this leading order result depends on the shift of the dilaton minimum induced by $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects (see Sec.~\ref{shiftsection}). We neglect possible phases of gaugino masses. We will return to this question in the context of the low-energy analysis of soft-terms~\cite{Aparicio:2015sda}.


\item \textbf{Scalar masses}\\

Scalar masses in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-terms contributions. Let us study them separately, presenting their leading order expressions.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{F-terms contributions}\\
Assuming a diagonal K\"ahler matter metric as in~(\ref{mm}), the general expression for the F-terms contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation is~\cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{align}
\label{genscalF}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F = m_{3/2}^2 - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln \tilde{K}_\alpha\,.
\end{align}

\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we obtain universal scalar masses, $m_\alpha^2=m_0^2$ $\forall \alpha$, where
\begin{align}
\left.m_0^2\right|_F &\simeq m_{3/2}^2 - \left(\frac{F^{T_b}}{2}\right)^2 \partial^2_{\tau_b} \ln\tilde{K}
\simeq \nonumber\\ \\
&\simeq \frac{15}{2}\left(c_s-\frac{1}{3}\right)\, \frac{m_{3/2}^2 \tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}\sim m_{3/2} M_{1/2}\,,
\label{localscalar}
\end{align}
The dominant contribution to this expression comes from the F-term of $T_b$. More precisely, the leading term of $F^{T_b}$ in (\ref{FTb}) together with the leading term of $\tilde{K}$ in (\ref{newKtilde}) give a contribution which cancels against $m_{3/2}^2$ in (\ref{localscalar}) because of the underlying no-scale structure. The first non-vanishing term in (\ref{localscalar}) originates from the leading term of $F^{T_b}$
together with the first sub-leading correction to $\tilde{K}$. On the other hand, the sub-leading correction to $F^{T_b}$ in (\ref{FTb}) yields a contribution suppressed by $\epsilon_s$, and so turns out to be negligible.\\

Scalar masses are universal since they get generated by the F-term of $T_b$. Non-universal effects can arise from $F^S$ and $F^{U^a}$ but they are volume suppressed since they would give contributions of order $m_{3/2}^2/\mathcal{V}^2$. If $c_s>1/3,$ the scalar masses are non-tachyonic.

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: An interesting feature of (\ref{localscalar}) is that it vanishes if one takes the ultra-local limit $c_s= 1/3$.\footnote{We neglect potential higher order corrections at this stage.} In fact, there is a general argument~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} which guarantees the vanishing of $m_0^2$ at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$. Using (\ref{ul}) (the defining property of ultra-local models) in the general expression for the F-terms contributions to scalar masses (\ref{genscalF}) we find
\begin{align}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F = - \frac 13 V_{F,0} - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln h_\alpha(U,S)\,,
\label{ulsm2}
\end{align}
where we used the fact that $V_F= K_{I\overline{J}}F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}}- 3 m_{3/2}^2$. Recalling that $V_0 = V_{F,0} + V_{D,0}$ and setting the cosmological constant to zero (in the dS constructions of Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios} we showed how to cancel $V_0$ at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$ but this can in principle be done at any order in the $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ expansion), $V_{F,0}$ can be traded for $V_{D,0}$,
and we so shall include it in our analysis of D-terms contributions to scalar masses.\\

On the other hand, if the functions $h_\alpha(S,U)$ are not constants, there is a non-vanishing contribution
from the F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-2})$. Using (\ref{ds}), the $S$ and $U$-dependent contribution to scalar masses turns out to be
\begin{align}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F =  - M_{1/2}^2 s^2 \left(\partial_s^2+\beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a, s}
+ \beta^{U^a}\beta^{\overline{U}^b}\partial_{u^a,u^b}\right) \ln h_\alpha\sim {O}\left(M_{1/2}^2\right)\,,
\label{ulsm3}
\end{align}
where $M_{1/2}$ is the gaugino mass in (\ref{ggmm}). Note that this contribution is generically non-universal
and might also give rise to tachyonic scalars depending on the explicit functional dependence of the functions $h_\alpha(U,S)$.\\

\item \textbf{D-terms contributions}\\
Assuming a diagonal K\"ahler matter metric as in~\eqref{mm}, the general expression for the D-terms contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation is~\cite{Dudas:2005vv}
\begin{align}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_D = \tilde{K}_\alpha^{-1} \sum_i g_i^2 D_i \partial^2_{\alpha \overline{\alpha}} D_i- V_{D,0}\,.
\label{genscalD}
\end{align}
Given that this result depends on the value of the D-terms potential at the minimum, this contribution depends on the way to achieve a dS vacuum. As explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:Shrinking}, the VEV of the D-terms potential associated to visible sector $U(1)$s is vanishing in the absence of tachyonic scalars.\footnote{Even in the presence of tachyonic scalars, the contribution to scalar masses from visible sector D-terms turns out to be a negligible effect since visible matter fields, $\tau_\SM$ and $b$ would still be stabilized at zero at leading order.}

\medskip
\emph{dS case 1}: In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift} the relevant D-term is the one associated with the anomalous $U(1)$ living on the big cycle. As can be seen from (\ref{VD0ds1}), $V_{D,0}$ scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-10/3}$ which is sub-dominant with respect to the first term in (\ref{genscalD}) that gives
\begin{align}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D &= \frac{q_b}{2 f_\alpha(U,S)} D_{\dS_1} \partial_{\tau_b} \tilde{K}_{\alpha}= \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{3s}|\phi_\dS|^2 = \nonumber\\ \\
&= \frac{6\epsilon_s}{\omega'_S}m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim  {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\sqrt{\ln\mathcal{V}}}{\mathcal{V}}\right)\,,
\label{sc1}
\end{align}
once we impose the condition (\ref{CCconddS1}) to have a vanishing cosmological constant at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-3})$. In the local limit, this result is suppressed with respect to the F-terms contribution (\ref{localscalar}) by a factor of $\epsilon_s$. On the other hand, in the ultra-local limit, this D-terms contribution dominates over the F-terms one given in (\ref{ulsm3}) which scales as $m_{3/2}^2\epsilon^2$.
Hence it leads to universal and non-tachyonic scalar masses.

\medskip
\emph{dS case 2}: In the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift} the relevant D-term is the one associated with the anomalous $U(1)$ which belongs to the hidden sector responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. In this case both terms in (\ref{genscalD}) have the same scaling since
\begin{align}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D &= \frac{q_\dS \mathcal{V}^{2/3}}{2 s f_\alpha(U,S)} D_{\dS_2} \partial_{\tau_\dS} \tilde{K}_{\alpha}-V_{D,0} = \nonumber\\ \\
&= \frac{c_\dS}{s} D_{\dS_2} q_\dS\frac{\tau_\dS}{\mathcal{V}} -V_{D,0} = \left(2c_\dS-1\right)V_{D,0}\,.
\label{Vds22}
\end{align}
As can be seen from (\ref{VD0ds2}), $V_{D,0}$ scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-4}$. Hence in the local limit the D-terms contribution is sub-leading with respect to the F-terms one given in (\ref{localscalar}) which scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-3}$. In the ultra-local limit the F-terms contribution to scalar masses is given by (\ref{ulsm2}).
Adding $-V_{F,0}/3= V_{D,0}/3$ to (\ref{Vds22}) we find that the total D-terms contribution to scalar masses vanishes in the ultra-local limit once we impose $c_\dS=1/3$ as in (\ref{fdef}) since
\begin{align}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D =  2\left(c_\dS-\frac 13\right)V_{D,0}=0 \quad\text{for}\quad c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\label{Vds2}
\end{align}
Hence scalar masses get generated by F-terms also in the ultra-local limit. Their expression is given in (\ref{ulsm3}) and scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-4}$.\\

\noindent \textbf{Summary of the results for scalar masses}

Let us summarize our results for soft scalar masses. The expression for $m_0^2$ in the local limit does not depend on the way to obtain a dS vacuum since in each case it is given by the F-terms contribution (\ref{localscalar}) that scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-3}$. Scalar masses are non-tachyonic if $c_s>1/3$ and universal. On the other hand, the result for the ultra-local limit depends on the dS mechanism. In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift}, scalar masses get generated by the D-terms contribution (\ref{sc1}) which has again an overall $\mathcal{V}^{-3}$ scaling but with an $\epsilon_s$ suppression with respect to the local case. Scalar masses turn out to be non-tachyonic and universal. On the contrary, in the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift}, the main contribution to scalar masses comes from F-terms and it is given by (\ref{ulsm3}) which scales as $\mathcal{V}^{-4}$. This result could potentially lead to tachyonic and non-universal scalar masses depending on the exact functional dependence of the functions $h_\alpha(U,S)$.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{A-terms}\\
For the current discussion, we assume that the Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ receive no non-perturbative contributions from the K\"ahler moduli and are hence only functions of the complex structure moduli and the dilaton $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}=Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$. The trilinear A-terms in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-terms contributions. The D-terms contributions turn out to be zero for vanishing VEVs of visible sector matter fields~\cite{Dudas:2005vv}. On the other hand, the general formula for the F-terms contribution is~\cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{align}
\label{tril}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} &= F^I \partial_I \left[K + \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma}\right)\right] = \nonumber\\ \\
&= F^I \partial_I \left[K -3\ln\tilde{K}+ \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma}\right)\right],
\end{align}
where the holomorphic Yukawas $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$ do not depend on the K\"ahler moduli because of their axionic shift-symmetry. Let us present the expression for $A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ at leading order in $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we find
\begin{align}
\label{tril1}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}= &- \left[1 -s\beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a} K_{\rm cs} - \frac{6}{\omega'_S}\left(c_s-\frac 13\right) - \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&\left.- s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma} \right) \right] M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,,
\end{align}
with $\partial_{s,u}\equiv \partial_s+\beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a}$.
Note that there is a cancellation at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-1})$ between $K$ and $3\ln\tilde{K}$ in (\ref{tril}).
The dominant contributions to (\ref{tril1}) come from the F-terms of $T_b$, $S$ and $U$.

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: In the ultra-local limit defined by (\ref{ul}), the contribution to $A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ from $F^{T_b}$ vanishes, as can be seen at leading order in (\ref{tril1}) by setting $c_s=1/3$ and $f_{\alpha} = h_\alpha\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}(2s)^{-1/3}$. In this limit, the general expression (\ref{tril}) simplifies to
\begin{align}
\label{trilul}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = s \partial_{s,u}
\ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{h_\alpha h_\beta h_\gamma}\right) M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,.
\end{align}

\item \textbf{$\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$ terms}

Let us discuss different effects that can contribute to the superpotential and K\"ahler potential higgs bi-linear terms. Whether they are present or not is model-dependent and a concrete realization or combination of various mechanisms might not be possible. The following list should be understood as a list of possible effects that can lead to a non-vanishing $\mu$-term. The canonically normalized $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms receive contributions from both K\"ahler potential and superpotential effects.
Let us discuss these two different effects separately.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{K\"ahler potential contributions}

Non-zero $\hat{\mu}$ and $B \hat{\mu}$ get generated from a non-vanishing pre-factor $Z$ in the matter K\"ahler potential (\ref{mm})~\cite{Kim:1983dt,Giudice:1988yz}. Their general expression in gravity mediation is~\cite{Brignole:1993dj,Dudas:2005vv}
\begin{align}
&\hat{\mu} = \left(m_{3/2} Z - \overline{F}^{\overline{I}} \partial_{\overline{I}} Z\right)
\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2} \nonumber\\ \\
&B\hat{\mu} = \left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_F + \left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_D\,,
\label{muK}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
&\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_F = \left\{2 m_{3/2}^2 Z - m_{3/2} \overline{F}^{\overline{I}} \partial_{\overline{I}} Z + m_{3/2} F^I \left[\partial_I Z - Z \partial_I \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right]\right. \nonumber \\
&\left. - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \left[\partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} Z - \partial_I Z \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right] \right\}\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2} \,, \label{BmuKF} \\
&\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_D = \left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2}\left(\sum_i g_i^2 D_i \partial_{H_u} \partial_{H_d} D_i - V_{D,0} Z\right)\,.
\label{BmuKD}
\end{align}
Motivated by the fact that we are at the singular regime, we take $Z$ of the same form as the matter metric (\ref{mattermetric}) with $f_\alpha(U,S)$ replaced by a different unknown function of $S$ and $U$ which we denote $\gamma(U,S)$. We stress that $Z=\gamma(U,S)\tilde{K}$ is just the simplest ansatz for $Z$ given our present knowledge but its form could in general be different from $\tilde{K}_\alpha$.\footnote{However in models with a shift-symmetric higgs sector $f_{H_u}=f_{H_d}=\gamma$~\cite{LopesCardoso:1994is,Antoniadis:1994hg,Brignole:1995fb,Brignole:1996xb,Hebecker:2012qp}.}\\

Let us compute the leading expressions (in an expansion in $\mathcal{V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$) for both $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ in the local and ultra-local limit.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we find
\begin{align}
\hat\mu  =  \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u } f_{H_d}}} \left[\frac{6}{3 \omega'_S} \left(c_s-\frac 13\right)
- s \partial_{s,u} \ln\gamma \right] M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,,
\label{mu11}
\end{align}
where again there is a cancellation at ${O}(\mathcal{V}^{-1})$ between the term proportional to $m_{3/2}$ in (\ref{muK}) and the leading order contribution from $\overline{F}^{\overline{T}_b}\partial_{\overline{T}_b}Z$. The dominant contributions to (\ref{mu11}) come from the F-terms of $T_b$, $S$ and $U$. On the other hand, the $B\hat\mu$-term behaves as the soft scalar masses since both F- and D-terms contributions can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_{F,D} = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u} f_{H_d}}}\, \left.m_0^2\right|_{F,D}\,.
\label{bmu11}
\end{align}
Recalling our results for $m_0^2$, we realize that in the local limit the leading contribution to $B\hat\mu$ comes from F-terms and scales as $\left.m_0^2\right|_F$ in (\ref{localscalar}). Hence the final result for $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{align}
B\hat{\mu} = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u} f_{H_d}}}\, \frac{5\left(c_s-\frac 13\right)}{\omega'_S} m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\left(\ln\mathcal{V}\right)^{3/2}}{\mathcal{V}}\right)\,.
\label{bmu11local}
\end{align}

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: Similarly to the ultra-local limit for $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ defined by (\ref{ul}), we can define also an ultra-local limit for $Z=\gamma(U,S)\tilde{K}$ as $Z\equiv z(U,S)\,e^{K/3}$ which implies
\begin{align}
\label{fdef2}
\gamma(U,S) = \frac{z(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}}\qquad \text{and}\qquad c_s=c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\end{align}
In this limit the F-term of $T_b$ does not contribute to $\hat\mu$ whose expression simplifies to
\begin{align}
\label{mu2}
\hat\mu  =  - \frac{z\,s\partial_{s,u} \ln\gamma}{\sqrt{h_{H_u } h_{H_d}}}\,M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\, .
\end{align}
In this ultra-local case the expression (\ref{BmuKF}) for $\left.B\hat\mu\right|_F$ gives
\begin{align}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_F = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u } h_{H_d}}}\left[\sigma(U,S) \,M_{1/2}^2-\frac 13 V_{F,0}\right]\,,
\label{Bmu2}
\end{align}
where $\sigma(U,S)$ is a complicated ${O}(1)$ function of $S$ and $U$ which looks like
\begin{align}
\sigma(U,S) =&\, \frac 19 \left(1-s\beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a}K_{\rm cs} \right)
\left[1 - 3 s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(h_{H_u} h_{H_d}\right)\right] + \nonumber \\
&+ s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(h_{H_u} h_{H_d}\right) s \partial_{s,u}\ln z- \nonumber\\ \\
&- s^2\left[\partial_s \ln z \,\partial_{s,u} \ln \partial_s z +\beta^{U^a} \partial_{u^a} \ln z \,\partial_{s,u} \ln \partial_{u^a} z\right]\,. \nonumber
\end{align}
Recalling that $V_0 = V_{F,0} + V_{D,0}=0$, $V_{F,0}$ can be traded for $V_{D,0}$, and so we shall include it in our analysis of D-terms contributions to $B\hat\mu$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:MatterUplift}, the D-terms generated $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{align}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_D &= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\left.m_0^2\right|_D = \nonumber\\ \\
&= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\frac{6\epsilon_s}{\omega'_S}m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim  {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\sqrt{\ln\mathcal{V}}}{\mathcal{V}}\right)\,,
\label{bmu2dS1}
\end{align}
where we used the result in (\ref{sc1}). This term dominates over the F-terms contribution given in (\ref{Bmu2}).

\item In the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{sssec:DilatonUplift}, the D-terms generated $B\hat\mu$ is vanishing since
\begin{align}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_D &= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\left.m_0^2\right|_D = \nonumber\\ \\
&= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,2\left(c_\dS-\frac 13\right)V_{D,0}=0 \quad\text{for}\quad c_\dS=\frac 13\,,
\label{bmu2dS2}
\end{align}
where we used the result in (\ref{Vds2}). Thus in this case $B\hat\mu$ is generated purely by F-terms and it is given by (\ref{Bmu2}) without the term proportional to $V_{F,0}$ that we included in the D-terms contribution. Hence the final result for $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{align}
B\hat\mu = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\sigma(U,S) \,M_{1/2}^2\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}^2\right)\,.
\label{Bmu22}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}


\item \textbf{Superpotential contributions}

Let us discuss the contributions to $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ from $\mu\neq 0$ in $W_{\rm matter}$ given by (\ref{Wmatter}). Their general expression in gravity mediation reads~\cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{align}
\label{muW}
&\hat{\mu} = \frac{\mu\,e^{K/2}}{\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{1/2}}\,,& \\
\label{BmuW}
&B\hat{\mu} = \frac{\mu\,e^{K/2}}{\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{1/2}} \left[F^I \left(K_I + \partial_I \ln\mu - \partial_I \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right) - m_{3/2}\right]\,.&
\end{align}

\medskip
\emph{Non-perturbative effects}: Non-perturbative effects can generate in the low-energy action an effective $\mu$-term of the form (up to pre-factors)
\begin{align}
W\supset e^{-a T} H_u H_d\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mu_{\rm eff} = e^{-a T}\,,
\label{Wnpmu}
\end{align}
if the cycle $\tau={\rm Re}(T)$ is in the geometric regime~\cite{Ibanez:2007tu} or
\begin{align}
W\supset e^{-b \left(S+\kappa T\right)} H_u H_d\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mu_{\rm eff} = e^{-b\left(S+\kappa T\right)}\,,
\label{Wnpmu2}
\end{align}
if the cycle $\tau={\rm Re}(T)$ is in the singular regime, i.e. $\tau\to 0$~\cite{Berenstein:2005xa}. Note that there are two distinct classes of non-perturbative contributions leading to the above EFT coupling: if the higgs bi-linear is forbidden by anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries, charged instanton contributions for instance via ED3 can realize such a coupling~\cite{Ibanez:2007tu,Berenstein:2005xa}. Alternatively, if the higgs-bilinear is forbidden by an approximate global symmetry of the local model, this global symmetry is broken by compactification effects. For the latter case, ref.~\cite{Berg:2012aq} studied the topological conditions under which non-perturbative effects of the form (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2}) contribute to the effective action. If $T$ is a bulk cycle, the coupling (\ref{Wnpmu}) is always generated but in our case it would be negligible since this effect would be proportional to $e^{-\mathcal{V}^{2/3}}$. On the other hand, if $T$ is the blow-up of a local singularity, the couplings (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2}) get generated only if this divisor shares a homologous two-cycle with the blow-up mode $T_\SM$ of the MSSM singularity. This condition is not satisfied if either $T$ or $T_\SM$ is a very simple divisor like a dP$_0$ which has been used in the explicit global models of~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw} and~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.\\

If in both cases the appropriate conditions are satisfied, both (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2}) would lead to a non-vanishing contribution which can be parametrized as follows
\begin{align}
\hat{\mu} \simeq c_{\mu,W}(U,S)\, \frac{M_{\rm P}}{\mathcal{V}^{n+\frac 13}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad B \hat{\mu} \simeq c_{B,W}(U,S) \,\frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{\mathcal{V}^{n+ \frac 43}}\,,
\label{mumag}
\end{align}
where in (\ref{Wnpmu}) we have set $T=T_s$ and $a=n a_s$ with $n>0$, while in (\ref{Wnpmu2}) we have parametrized $b=n a_s$ recalling that $s\simeq \tau_s$ from (\ref{eq:TausMinimumCorrected}). $c_{\mu,W}$ and $c_{B,W}$ are constants which absorb the dependence on the pre-factor of the instanton contribution, the complex structure moduli and the dilaton. Note that for different values of $n$ non-perturbative effects could generate $\hat{\mu}$ and $B \hat{\mu}$ in the complete range interesting for MSSM phenomenology regardless of the size of the other soft-terms. However these effects can be in competition with K\"ahler potential contributions for $n \geq 5/3$.\\

\emph{Background fluxes}: Primitive $(1,2)$ IASD fluxes
can generate $\hat\mu$ for D3-branes at singularities~\cite{Grana:2003ek,Grana:2002nq,Camara:2003ku}. However, given that their contribution is proportional to the F-terms of the complex structure moduli, this effect has already been included in the contributions from the K\"ahler potential. In other words, direct computations of soft-terms by reducing the D3-brane action in a fluxed background show that $\mu=0$~\cite{Grana:2003ek}.\\

\newpage
\item \textbf{Anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries}

A term proportional to $H_u H_d$ in $K$ or $W$ could be forbidden in the presence of an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry. In this case, the only way to generate a higgs bilinear would be to multiply this term by an operator involving a $U(1)$-charged field which makes the whole contribution gauge invariant. As already discussed above, the only closed string moduli that can lead to such an effect are K\"ahler moduli.\\

Alternatively, the $U(1)$-charged field could be an open string mode $\Phi$ appearing in $K$ and $W$
in a gauge invariant combination of the form ($\Lambda$ denotes the appropriate moduli-dependent cut-off)
\begin{align}
K\supset \left(\frac{\Phi}{\Lambda}\right)^m H_u H_d\,,\quad \quad W\supset\frac{\Phi^m}{\Lambda^{m-1}} H_u H_d\,.
\label{KWphi}
\end{align}
Thus the field $\Phi$ has to be an MSSM singlet since a higgs bilinear gets generated only when $\Phi$ develops a non-zero VEV breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry. However, as can be seen from eqs. (\ref{dtermpot}) and (\ref{xiSM}), D-terms stabilization fixes the VEV of $\Phi$ in terms of $\tau_\SM$: $|\Phi|^2 \propto \tau_\SM/\mathcal{V}$, and so the couplings in (\ref{KWphi}) would give rise to effective $\mu$ and $Z$-terms which depend only on closed string moduli
\begin{align}
Z_{\rm eff}\propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^m}\left(\frac{\tau_\SM}{\mathcal{V}}\right)^{m/2}\,,
\quad \quad\mu_{\rm eff}\propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^{m-1}}\left(\frac{\tau_\SM}{\mathcal{V}}\right)^{m/2}\,.
\label{Eff}
\end{align}
Once the cut-off $\Lambda$ is explicitly written in terms of $T$-moduli, one could plug (\ref{Eff}) into the standard supergravity formulas to work out the final contribution to $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$. The result will depend on the VEV and the F-term of $T_\SM$. As discussed in~\cite{Cicoli:2013cha}, $\Phi$ needs to receive tachyonic contribution from soft-terms in order for $T_\SM$ to develop a non-zero VEV. If this condition is satisfied, $\tau_\SM \sim \mathcal{V}^{-1}$ implying $F^{T_\SM}\sim \mathcal{V}^{-2}$ for the local case
and $\tau_\SM \sim \mathcal{V}^{-3}$ implying $F^{T_\SM}\sim \mathcal{V}^{-4}$ for the ultra-local case.
This effect corresponds to switching on an FI-term, and so to breaking the anomalous $U(1)$ by moving slightly away from the singularity. However in both cases the VEV of $\tau_\SM$ is smaller than unity, and so we are still consistently in the singular regime.\\

Given that all these results are clearly model-dependent and require physics beyond the MSSM, at this stage we do not pursue these options in more detail and leave them for future work. Let us just mention that the only case where the effective $\mu$-term in (\ref{Eff}) does not depend on $\Lambda$ is for $m=1$. In this situation $\hat\mu$ would scale as $\mathcal{V}^{-4/3}$ in the local case and as $\mathcal{V}^{-7/3}$ in the ultra-local case. If instead $\Phi$ does not receive tachyonic contributions from soft-terms, another option would be to consider models where $\Phi$ develops a non-zero VEV because of radiative effects.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of Soft-terms}

Let us summarize our results for the soft-terms in the two cases to obtain dS vacua (see also Table~\ref{tab:PhenoScenarios}). Given that in each case the gaugino masses turn out to have the same value, we will use $M_{1/2}$ as a useful parameter which can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
M_{1/2} = c_{1/2} m_{3/2}\,\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}\, \left[ \ln\left(\frac{M_{\rm P}}{m_{3/2}}\right)\right]^{3/2}\, ,
\end{align}
where $c_{1/2}$ is a flux-dependent tunable coefficient. We will state our results for the model-independent case where $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ are generated from moduli induced K\"ahler potential contributions. If these contributions are absent (for example if these terms are forbidden by anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries), then $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ can take different values because of model-dependent contributions from either $K$ or $W$ as previously discussed. Let us discuss the local and ultra-local limits separately.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit, the soft-terms turn out to be the same in both dS mechanisms (all the $c$'s are flux-dependent parameters)
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SummarySoftLocal}
&m_0^2 = c_0\,m_{3/2} M_{1/2}\,,\quad &A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,, \nonumber\\ \\
&\hat\mu= c_{\mu,K}\,Z\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad &B\hat\mu = c_{B,K}\,Z\,m_0^2\,.
\end{align}

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: In the ultra-local limit, the soft-terms take different forms in the two dS cases
(again all the $c$'s are flux-dependent coefficients which are distinct in different scenarios)
\begin{enumerate}
\item dS vacua from hidden matter fields
\begin{align}
&m_0^2 = c_{0}\,\frac{m_{3/2}M_{1/2}}{\ln\left(M_{\rm P}/m_{3/2}\right)}\,,\quad &A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,, \nonumber\\ \\
&\hat\mu= c_{\mu,K}\,Z\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad &B\hat\mu = c_{B,K}\,Z\,m_0^2\,;
\end{align}
\item dS vacua from non-perturbative effects at singularities
\begin{align}
&m_\alpha = (c_{0})_\alpha\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad &A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,, \nonumber\\ \\
&\hat\mu= c_{\mu,K}\,Z\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad &B\hat\mu = c_{B,K}\,Z\,M_{1/2}^2\,.
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
Clearly, the local limit and the dS case 1 for the ultra-local limit correspond to typical (mini-)Split-SUSY scenarios whereas the dS case 2 for the ultra-local limit reproduces a standard MSSM picture with universal gaugino masses and soft masses all of the same order. If the flux-dependent coefficients for the scalar masses are universal $(c_0)_\alpha=c_0,$ a standard CMSSM scenario emerges. Non-universalities in the flux-dependent coefficients can lead to interesting soft-terms patterns such as in NUHM or natural SUSY scenarios. We discuss the dark matter phenomenology related to these scenarios in Chap.~\ref{chap:NonThermalDM}~\cite{Aparicio:2015sda}.\\

\caption{Summary of soft-terms for different sequestered scenarios for the two dS mechanisms discussed in the text: hidden sector matter (dS$_1$) and non-perturbative effects at singularities~(dS$_2$). All soft-terms are hierarchically smaller than $m_{3/2}$. Gaugino masses, A-terms and the $\hat{\mu}$-term take the same value in each case whereas scalar masses and hence the $B\hat{\mu}$-term are model-dependent. The coefficients $c$ are flux-dependent and can generically take different values in each scenario presented here while $n$ is a positive model-dependent parameter. They can be tuned to compare with data. Local and ultra-local 1 cases give a Split-SUSY spectrum while ultra local 2 implies a standard MSSM spectrum with soft-masses of the same order and possible small non-universalities due to the flux-dependent parameters $c$.}

For illustrative purposes, we just mention here two simple benchmark models for the dS case 2 in the ultra-local limit. Setting all the $\beta$'s to zero, we find

\medskip
\emph{Benchmark model 1: $h_\alpha=z=1$}
\begin{align}
m_\alpha \simeq 0\,\,\,\forall\alpha\,,\quad A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,,
\quad\hat\mu= \frac{M_{1/2}}{3} \,,\quad B\hat\mu = \hat\mu^2\,,
\end{align}
where $(c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}=s\partial_s \ln Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$.
This reproduces a typical gaugino mediation scenario~\cite{Schmaltz:2000gy,Yanagida:2013ah}.

\medskip
\emph{Benchmark model 2: $f_\alpha=\gamma=1$}
\begin{align}
m_\alpha = m_0 = \frac{M_{1/2}}{\sqrt{3}}\,\,\,\forall\alpha\,,\quad A = -\sqrt{3}\,m_0\,,
\quad\hat\mu \simeq \frac{m_0}{\ln\left(M_{\rm P}/m_{3/2}\right)}\,,\quad B\hat\mu = m_0^2\,,
\end{align}
if the holomorphic Yukawas do not depend on $S$. This leads to a typical natural SUSY scenario for example if we allow $m_{H_u}$ to be slightly larger than $m_0$ together with a light third generation~\cite{Baer:2012uy}. This can be done by considering the more general case with non-zero $\beta$'s and allowing for a $U$-dependence in $f_\alpha$. The $\ln\left(M_{\rm P}/m_{3/2}\right)$ suppression of $\hat\mu$ with respect to $m_0$ comes from sub-leading contributions to $\hat\mu$ from $F^{T_s}$.

\section{Possible Sources of Desequestering}
\label{sec:DesequesteringSources}

There is a general belief that in any supergravity theory once SUSY is broken all sparticles should get a mass at least of the order of the scale determined by the split in the gravity multiplet. In particular, all soft masses are expected to be of order the gravitino mass. Furthermore, if for some reason some of the sparticle masses are found to be smaller than $m_{3/2}$ at tree level, since SUSY no longer protects these masses against quantum corrections, they should be lifted to a loop factor times $m_{3/2}$. So soft masses are expected to be at most one order of magnitude lighter than the gravitino mass but not much smaller.\footnote{This separation between $m_{3/2}$ and soft masses occurs for example in the case of mirage (mixed moduli and anomaly) mediation~\cite{LoaizaBrito:2005fa,Choi:2005hd}.} Effects which tend to push the soft masses to the scale of the gravitino mass are referred to as sources of \textit{desequestering}. In this section we will argue that our models can be stable against desequestering effects.

\subsection{Loop Corrections}

For sequestered string scenarios, it is natural to expect that loop corrections bring soft masses to a magnitude of order a loop factor times $m_{3/2}$. However there can be exceptions since the couplings can be Planck suppressed. A detailed calculation of loop corrections to the mass of bulk scalars like the volume modulus (its tree level mass $m_\mathcal{V} \sim m_{3/2}/\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ is hierarchically smaller than $m_{3/2}$) was presented in~\cite{Burgess:2010sy}.\\

The size of loop corrections can be estimated by realizing that, if SUSY is broken, loop corrections to the mass should be given by the heaviest particles circulating in the loop (or the cut-off scale) which is the Kaluza-Klein scale $M_\KK\sim M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^{2/3}$. In the absence of SUSY there is a need of a SUSY-breaking insertion (a spurion field representing the relevant F-term) in the loop and the correction to the mass is at most
\begin{align}
\delta m=\alpha_\lp \frac{M_\KK m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}\sim \alpha_\lp\frac{W_0}{\mathcal{V}^{5/3}}\ll \alpha_\lp m_{3/2}\,,
\end{align}
with $\alpha_\lp\sim g^2/(16\pi^2)$ a loop factor. Note that the ratio $\delta m/m\sim \alpha_\lp \mathcal{V}^{-1/6}$ is very small and therefore the volume modulus mass is stable against loop corrections.\\

For matter fields located at the Standard Model brane, loop corrections should be even further suppressed.
The effective field theory on the brane is supersymmetric and feels the effects of SUSY-breaking in the bulk only via Planck suppressed couplings. Therefore masses as small as $M_{\rm soft}\sim W_0/\mathcal{V}^2$ are still stable under standard loop corrections (since volume suppressed brane-bulk couplings imply $\delta M_{\rm soft}\ll \delta m$).\\

Over the years explicit calculations have been performed estimating loop corrections to soft masses in no-scale
and general gravity mediated models. See for example~\cite{Ellis:1986nr,Antoniadis:1997ic} in which loop corrections to scalar and gaugino masses were estimated in supergravity and M-theory frameworks with results of order $\delta m \sim \alpha_\lp m_{3/2}^2/M_{\rm P}\sim \alpha_\lp M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^2$. More recently, explicit calculations for gravitino loop contributions to gaugino masses was performed in~\cite{Lee:2013aia}. The diagrams are quadratically divergent and proportional to the gravitino mass:
\begin{align}
\delta M_{1/2} = \frac{m_{3/2}}{16\pi^2}\left(\frac{\Lambda^2}{M_{\rm P}^2}+\dots\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\Lambda$ is the cut-off scale and the dots represent sub-leading logarithmically divergent terms. In string theory we expect that $\Lambda\leq M_s\sim M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ which then corrects the gaugino masses to order $\delta M_{1/2}\leq \alpha_\lp M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^2$ which is smaller than the sequestered gaugino masses $M_{1/2}\sim M_{\rm P}/\mathcal{V}^2$.\\

This behavior of sequestered models motivated the work of Randall and Sundrum to introduce anomaly mediation.
However, as we will illustrate below, the approximate no-scale structure of LVS makes anomaly mediated corrections to soft-terms sub-leading (they vanish identically for no-scale models) in generic points of parameter space.

\subsection{Anomaly Mediated Contributions}
\label{anosec}

In this section we examine anomaly mediated contributions to soft-terms and compute their strength in the dS constructions discussed in Sec.~\ref{ssec:deSitterScenarios}. The anomaly mediated gaugino masses~\cite{Bagger:1999rd} are given by\footnote{Note that there is a certain discussion on the validity of this formula~\cite{deAlwis:2008aq}. For the purpose of the present chapter we assume that the standard derivation from field theory or string theory~\cite{Conlon:2010qy} is valid.}
\begin{align}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}=\frac{g^2}{16 \pi^2}\left[\left(T_R-3T_G\right)m_{3/2}+\left(T_G-T_R\right)F^I\partial_I K
+\frac{2T_R}{d_R}F^I\partial_I\ln\det \tilde{K}_{\alpha\beta}\right],
\label{eq:anomalygauginomasses}
\end{align}
where $T_{G,R}$ are the Dynkin indexes of the adjoint representation and the matter representation $R$ of dimension $d_R$ (summation over all matter representations is understood). Assuming that the K\"ahler metric for matter fields can be written as $\tilde{K}_{\alpha\beta}=\delta_{\alpha\beta} f_\alpha\tilde{K}$,
the expression (\ref{eq:anomalygauginomasses}) reduces to
\begin{align}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}=&\frac{g^2}{16 \pi^2}\left[\left(T_R-3T_G\right)m_{3/2}+\left(T_G-T_R\right)F^I\partial_I K
+ \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&\left.+\frac{2T_R}{\tilde{K}} F^I\partial_I\tilde{K}+\frac{2T_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} F^I\partial_I\ln f_\alpha\right].
\label{eq:anomalygauginomasses2}
\end{align}
In the local case, we find that the leading order anomaly mediated contribution can be written in terms
of the modulus dominated gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ given in (\ref{ggmm})
\begin{align}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom} =& \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} \left[\left(T_R - T_G\right)\left(1-s\beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a} K_{\rm cs}\right) - \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&\left. -\frac{4 T_R}{\omega_S'} \left(c_s-\frac 13 \right)+\frac{2sT_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} \partial_{s,u}\ln f_\alpha\right] M_{1/2},
\label{anorel}
\end{align}
with $\omega_S'$ as defined below (\ref{ds}). For the ultra-local case we find instead
\begin{align}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom} = \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} \left[\left(\frac{T_R}{3} - T_G\right)\left(1-s \beta^{U^a}\partial_{u^a} K_{\rm cs}\right) +\frac{2sT_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} \partial_{s,u}\ln h_\alpha\right] M_{1/2}\, .
\label{anorel2}
\end{align}
Therefore in both cases the anomaly mediated contribution is loop suppressed with respect to the moduli mediated one. This result is the consequence of the approximate no-scale structure of LVS models.\\

A more careful analysis is needed for a very particular point in the underlying parameter space:
$\omega_S' \to 0$, i.e. in the very tuned situation where the F-term of the dilaton is vanishing at leading order because of a special compensation between the contribution to $F^S$ from $D_S W$ and $D_{T_b} W$. In this case the leading contribution to gaugino masses given in (\ref{ggmm}) is zero and the first non-vanishing moduli mediated contribution can be estimated to scale as $M_{1/2}^{\rm new}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\ln\mathcal{V}}/\mathcal{V} $. On the other hand, the anomaly mediated contribution scales as $M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}\sim c \,M_{1/2}^{\rm new}$ where $c = c' \left(\frac{g^2}{16\pi^2}\right) \ln\mathcal{V}$ and $c'$ denotes a numerical factor arising from evaluating~\eqref{anorel2} exactly. For $g\simeq 0.1$ and $\mathcal{V} \simeq 5\cdot 10^6$ (the value needed to get $M_{1/2}^{\rm new}$ approximately around the TeV-scale), $c$ is roughly of order $c'\times10^{-3}.$ Depending on the exact value of $c',$ which is beyond the scope of this analysis, we can achieve competing contributions from moduli mediation and anomaly mediation.

\subsection{Moduli Redefinitions}

Desequestering can also potentially occur due to moduli redefinitions which might be necessary order by order in perturbation theory. This desequestering effect can for example arise due to a shift of the local cycle $\tau_\SM\rightarrow \tau_\SM+\alpha\ln\mathcal{V}$ which has the effect of making the soft-terms of the same order as the gravitino mass~\cite{Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm}.\\

Such moduli redefinitions depend on the structure of the D-branes configuration. In particular, it has been argued that redefinitions are absent for configurations involving only D3-branes at orbifold singularities but are present for D3-branes at orientifold singularities and in cases with both D3- and D7-branes (see~\cite{Conlon:2010ji}).\\

We emphasize that desequestering occurs only if the moduli redefinition leads to a change in the functional form of the K\"ahler potential. Arguments suggesting a change in the functional form were presented in~\cite{Conlon:2010ji} but an explicit computation of such a change is still not available in the literature. Some recent explicit computations of the K\"ahler potential~\cite{Grimm:2013bha, Junghans:2014zla} have shown that perturbative corrections can be such that, along with a field redefinition, there is also an additional term generated in the K\"ahler potential. In these cases, however, the two effects conspire to leave the functional form of the K\"ahler potential invariant. More detailed studies of perturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential are crucial to get a comprehensive understanding  of the relationship between moduli redefinitions and desequestering.

\subsection{Superpotential Desequestering}

Apart from potentially destroying the hierarchy between soft masses and $m_{3/2}$, various sub-leading effects can have important phenomenological consequences. Interesting constraints arise from non-perturbative terms in the superpotential involving visible sector fields~\cite{Berg:2010ha}. Superpotential terms of the type
\begin{align}
\label{sud}
\hat{W} = \left( \hat{\mu} H_u H_d + \hat {\lambda}^u_{ij} Q^i u^j H_u
+ \hat {\lambda}^d_{ij}  Q^i d^j H_d + \hat {\lambda}^u_{ij} L^i e^j H_d \right) e^{-a_s T_s}\,,
\end{align}
would lead to flavour violation and CP-violation via A-terms with a strength sensitive to the hierarchy between soft masses and $m_{3/2}$. For $M_{\rm soft}^2 \sim m_{3/2}^2/\mathcal{V}^n$ the strength of CP and flavour violation induced by A-terms would be
\begin{align}
\label{flav}
\delta \sim  \mathcal{V}^n   10^{-16} \left( {v \over 100 \phantom{.} {\rm GeV}} \right)\,,
\end{align}
with $v$ equal to the higgs VEV. CP violation and FCNC bounds then require $\mathcal{V} < 10^5$. This gives a slight tension with our results but there can be several ways around this issue. The estimate~(\ref{flav}) is based on effective field theory arguments; it assumes generic order one coefficients for the superpotential terms in (\ref{sud}). A string computation of  the coefficients was done in~\cite{Berg:2012aq}. This indicates that the coefficients are suppressed unless the Standard Model cycle and the cycle on which the instanton is supported share a homologous two-cycle. The presence of flavour symmetries~\cite{Conlon:2008wa, Dolan:2011qu, Krippendorf:2010hj, Maharana:2011wx} in the visible sector can also alleviate this tension.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this chapter we have analyzed soft-terms for LVS sequestered models with dS moduli stabilization. These models are particularly attractive for phenomenological reasons: the string scale is around the GUT scale, soft masses are at the TeV scale and the lightest modulus is much heavier than the bound imposed by the CMP. The volume of the compactification is of order $\mathcal{V}\sim 10^7$ in string units and the visible sector can be localized on D3-branes at a singularity.\\

The pattern of soft-terms for these models has been previously studied in~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In this chapter we have deepened the analysis of~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} by studying the effect on soft-terms of the sector responsible to realize a dS vacuum, and by classifying in a systematic way any possible correction to the leading no-scale structure of soft-terms. In particular, given that soft-terms depend on the moduli-dependence of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields $\tilde{K}_\alpha$, we defined two possible limits for $\tilde{K}_\alpha$: \emph{Local scenarios} where $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ is such that the visible sector Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ do not depend on $\mathcal{V}$ only at leading order in an inverse volume expansion, and \emph{Ultra-local scenarios} where $Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ are exactly independent on $\mathcal{V}$ at all orders.\footnote{Evidence in favor of ultralocality has been obtained from explicit string computations in toroidal orbifolds~\cite{Conlon:2011jq}. The case of realistic CY compactifications remains to be explored.} Moreover, due to the present lack of explicit string computations of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$, we parametrized its dependence on the dilaton and complex structure moduli as an unknown function $f_\alpha(U,S)$.\\

The computation of soft-terms has produced a wide range of phenomenological possibilities depending on the exact moduli-dependence of the matter K\"ahler metric and the way to achieve a dS vacuum. We considered two dS realizations based on supersymmetric effective actions: \emph{dS case 1} where hidden sector matter fields living on a bulk cycle develop non-vanishing F-terms because of D-terms fixing, and \emph{dS case 2} where the blow-up mode of a singularity different from the visible sector one develops non-zero F-terms due to non-perturbative effects. Broadly speaking, we found two classes of models:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Split-SUSY}: Local models and ultra-local models in the dS case 1 yield gaugino masses and A-terms which are suppressed with respect to scalar masses: $M_{1/2} \sim m_{3/2}\epsilon\ll m_0 \sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}\ll m_{3/2}$ for $\epsilon \sim m_{3/2}/M_{\rm P}\ll 1$. For volumes of order of $10^7$ in string units these models provide a version of the Split-SUSY scenario with a `largish' splitting between gauginos and scalars (according to current experimental bounds). Non-universalities are present but suppressed by inverse powers of the volume.
\item \emph{Standard MSSM}: For ultra-local models in the dS case 2, all soft-terms are of the same order: $M_{1/2} \sim m_0 \sim m_{3/2}\epsilon\ll m_{3/2}$. Therefore these models include the CMSSM parameter space and its possible generalizations since each soft-term comes along with a tunable flux-dependent coefficient. Moreover, depending on the exact functional dependence of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields, these models can also feature non-universalities which are constrained by the experimental bounds on flavour changing neutral currents.
\end{enumerate}

Let us stress again that the exact numerical coefficients of the soft-terms are functions of the dilaton and complex structure moduli which are fixed in terms of flux quanta. Hence soft-terms vary as one scans through the string landscape. This crucial property of our scenarios gives supersymmetric models the freedom to perform any tuning which is needed for phenomenological reasons. In particular, it is low-energy SUSY that addresses the hierarchy problem by stabilizing the higgs mass at the weak scale, while scanning through the landscape provides small variations in the size of soft-terms as necessary to reproduce all the detailed features of experimental data. This tuning at low energies can be viewed as a choice of parameters in the high scale theory. There is a large freedom of choice in the high scale theory which is however not arbitrary since this freedom is provided by the theory itself (by having a computable landscape of vacua).\\

Note that in the ultra-local case the two ways to achieve a dS vacuum give rise to a different pattern of soft-terms. This can intuitively be understood as follows: the depth of the LVS AdS vacuum is of order $m_{3/2}^2\epsilon$, and so any extra term which yields a dS solution has to be of this order of magnitude. In turn, if the field $\phi$ responsible for dS uplifting is not decoupled from the visible sector, scalar masses of order $m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}$ are expected to arise because of this new contribution to the scalar potential. This is actually what happens in the dS case 1 since $\phi$ lives on a bulk cycle, and so it is not decoupled from the visible sector. On the other hand, in the dS case 2 $\phi$ lives on a singularity which is geometrically separated from the one supporting the visible sector. This gives rise to an effective decoupling between $\phi$ and the visible sector, resulting in suppressed scalar masses.\\

We would also like to emphasize that our analysis for the dS case 1, together with~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}
(which provided visible sector models embedded in moduli stabilized compact CYs), provides a very comprehensive study of SUSY-breaking in string theory.\\

The soft-terms which are more complicated to estimate are the $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms since they receive contributions from both the K\"ahler potential and the superpotential. Moreover, these contributions could generically be forbidden in models with branes at singularities because of the presence of anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries. In this case, effective $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms could still be generated due to non-perturbative corrections (e.g. D-branes instantons) or matter fields which develop non-vanishing VEVs. However in this last case, besides the need to go beyond the MSSM by including additional matter fields, any prediction for $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms would necessarily be model-dependent.

\section{Motivation for Non-thermal Dark Matter}
\label{sec:motivation}

One of the main particle physics candidates for DM is a stable neutralino $\chi$ which emerges as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in several scenarios beyond the Standard Model. The DM relic abundance is generically \emph{assumed} to be produced thermally by the following process: the LSP is in a thermal bath in the early universe, subsequently drops out of thermal equilibrium and freezes-out at temperatures of order
$T_f \simeq m_{\rm DM}/20$ when DM annihilation becomes inefficient.\\

However, we have no direct observational evidence of the history of the universe before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for temperatures above $T_{\rm BBN} \simeq 3$ MeV. There is therefore no reason to assume a very simple cosmological history characterized by just a single period of radiation dominance from the end of inflation until BBN. In fact, the presence of a period of matter domination between the end of inflation and BBN could completely change the final prediction for the DM relic density if the reheating temperature at the end of this period of matter dominance is below $T_f$~\cite{Barrow:1982ei, Kamionkowski:1990ni, Moroi:1999zb, Fujii:2001xp, Kitano:2008tk, Dutta:2009uf}.\\

This non-thermal picture emerges generically in UV theories like string theory due to the ubiquitous presence of gravitationally coupled scalars~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, Banks:1993en, deCarlos:1993wie, Acharya:2008bk, Acharya:2009zt, Acharya:2010af, Allahverdi:2013noa}. During inflation these fields, called moduli, get a displacement from their minimum that is in general of order $M_{\rm P}$~\cite{Dine:1995kz}. After the end of inflation, when the Hubble constant reaches their mass, $H\sim m_{\rm mod}$, they start oscillating around their minimum and store energy. Redshifting as matter, they quickly dominate the energy density of the universe which gets reheated when the moduli decay. Being only gravitationally coupled, the moduli tend to decay very late when $H\sim \Gamma \sim m_{\rm mod}^3/M_{\rm P}^2$. The corresponding reheating temperature
\begin{align}
T_{\rm rh} \sim \sqrt{\Gamma M_{\rm P}}\sim 0.1 \,m_{\rm mod} \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm mod}}{M_{\rm P}}}\,,
\end{align}
has to be larger than $T_{\rm BBN}$ in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions.\footnote{$T_{\rm rh}$ has also to be lower than the temperature above which the internal space decompactifies~\cite{Buchmuller:2004tz, Anguelova:2009ht}.} This requirement sets a lower bound on the moduli masses of order $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^5$ GeV~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, Banks:1993en, deCarlos:1993wie}.\\

Generically in string compactifications SUSY-breaking effects develop a mass for the moduli and generate by gravity or anomaly mediation soft-terms of order $M_{\rm soft}$. Due to their common origin, the mass of the lightest modulus $m_{\rm mod}$ is therefore related to the scale of the soft-terms as $M_{\rm soft} = \kappa m_{\rm mod}$. Given the cosmological constraint $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^5$ GeV, only models with $\kappa\ll 1$ can allow for low-energy SUSY to solve the hierarchy problem. Values of $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-2})$ can come from loop suppression factors~\cite{Choi:2005ge, Lowen:2008fm, Acharya:2008zi,Dudas:2012wi} while much smaller values $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$ can arise due to sequestering effects~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. For $M_{\rm soft}\sim {O}(1)$ TeV, the corresponding reheating temperature becomes
\begin{align}
T_R \sim  \frac{M_{\rm soft}}{\kappa^{3/2}} \sqrt{\frac{M_{\rm soft}}{M_{\rm P}}} \sim \,\kappa^{-3/2}\,{O}(10^{-2})\,\,{\rm MeV}\,,
\end{align}
which for $10^{-2}\lesssim\kappa\lesssim 10^{-4}$ is between ${O}(10)$ MeV and ${O}(10)$ GeV. This is below the freeze-out temperature for LSP masses between ${O}(100)$ GeV and ${O}(1)$ TeV which is
$T_f \sim {O}(10-100)$ GeV. Therefore any DM relic density previously produced via the standard thermal mechanism gets erased by the late-time decay of the lightest modulus. In this new scenario, the LSP gets produced non-thermally from the modulus decay.\\

From a bottom-up perspective, non-thermal cosmological histories can also enlarge the available parameter space of different DM models consistent with direct and indirect detection experiments, due to the presence of the additional parameter $T_R$. This is appealing as it is very hard to reproduce a correct thermal relic density in the CMSSM/mSUGRA (see for instance~\cite{Baer:2012uya}) since a bino-like LSP tends to overproduce DM
(apart from some fine-tuned cases like stau co-annihilation and A-funnel or in the case of precision gauge coupling unification~\cite{Krippendorf:2013dqa}) while for a higgsino- or wino-like LSP the relic density is in general under-abundant (except for cases like well tempered bino/higgsino or bino/wino DM~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb}).\\

The purpose of this chapter is to study the production of Non-Thermal DM in the CMMS, where the free parameters are: the standard parameters of the CMSSM/mSUGRA~\cite{Arnowitt:1992aq, Barger:1993gh, Kane:1993td, Baer:1996kv}, i.e.~the universal scalar mass $m$, universal gaugino mass $M$ and trilinear coupling $A$ defined at the GUT scale, $\tan\beta$ and the sign of $\mu$, with in addition the reheating temperature $T_R$ from the decay of the lightest modulus. We shall follow the RG running of these parameters from the GUT to the electroweak (EW) scale and require a higgs mass $m_h \simeq 125$ GeV, a correct radiative EW symmetry breaking (REWSB) and no DM non-thermal overproduction. We shall then focus on the points satisfying all these requirements and we will impose on them several phenomenological constraints coming from LEP~\cite{LEP1, LEP2, LEP3, LEP4}, LHC~\cite{Aad:2014wea,Aad:2012hm, Chatrchyan:2012lia, Aad:2014vma, Khachatryan:2014qwa}, Planck~\cite{Ade:2015xua}, Fermi (pass 8 limit)~\cite{Ackermann:2015tah}, XENON100~\cite{Orrigo:2015cha}, CDMS~\cite{Agnese:2013rvf}, IceCube~\cite{Aartsen:2012kia} and LUX~\cite{Akerib:2013tjd}. Moreover we shall focus only on cases where the LSP has a non-negligible higgsino component since bino-like DM requires a very low reheating temperature which is strongly disfavored by dark radiation bounds in the context of many string models~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. Interestingly we shall find that the constraints from Fermi and LUX are very severe and do not rule out the entire non-thermal CMSSM parameter space only for reheating temperatures $T_R\gtrsim {O}(1)$ GeV. The best case scenario is realized for $T_R = 2$ GeV where a higgsino-like LSP with a mass around $300$ GeV can saturate the observed DM relic abundance. For larger reheating temperatures the LSP bino component has to increase, resulting in strong direct detection bounds which allow only for cases with DM underproduction. Values of $T_R$ above $1$ GeV require values of $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$ which can be realized only in models where the CMSSM is sequestered from the sources of SUSY-breaking~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In these models the contribution to gaugino masses from anomaly mediation turns out to be negligibly small and hence is distinct from other scenarios~\cite{Choi:2005ge, Lowen:2008fm, Acharya:2008zi, Dudas:2012wi} where contributions from anomaly mediation are significant and where a wino LSP can be realized. Apart from DM, these models are very promising since they can be embedded in globally consistent CY compactifications~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha}, allow for TeV-scale SUSY and successful inflationary models~\cite{Conlon:2005jm, Burgess:2013sla, Cicoli:2011zz}, do not feature any CMP,\footnote{Ref.~\cite{Dutta:2014tya} provides a significant bound on moduli masses and the number of e-foldings during inflation which can be a challenge for many models.} are compatible with gauge coupling unification and do not suffer from any moduli-induced gravitino problem~\cite{Endo:2006zj, Nakamura:2006uc}. Non-standard thermal history using CMSSM was considered  in ref.~\cite{Roszkowski:2014lga} where the entropy due to the decay of the inflaton reduces the thermal relic abundance. In this thesis, however, we consider that the DM particles from the moduli decay constitute the DM abundance and the thermal  DM abundance contribution to the net DM content is negligible since $T_r$ is not required to be very close to $T_f$.\\

In Sec.~\ref{ssec:CMSSMSoftTerms} we discuss CMSSM soft-terms, in Sec.~\ref{ssec:NTDMCMSSMResults} we analyze the non-thermal CMSSM, in Sec.~\ref{ssec:DiscussionResults} we discuss our results.

\section{CMSSM Soft-Terms}
\label{ssec:CMSSMSoftTerms}

In a UV completion of the MSSM like string theory, SUSY is spontaneously broken by some dynamical mechanism which generates particular relations between the soft-terms via gravity, anomaly or gauge mediation. In the case when the soft-terms are universal at the GUT scale, they are given by the scalar mass $m$, the gaugino mass $M$, the trilinear coupling $A$ and the bilinear higgs mixing $B$. We can generically parametrize these soft-terms and the $\mu$ parameter at the GUT scale as:
\begin{align}
m = a\ |M|\,,\quad A = b\ M\,,\quad B = c \ M\,, \quad \mu = d\ M\,,
\label{CMSSM}
\end{align}
where, in a stringy embedding, the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are functions of the underlying parameters while the gaugino mass $M$ sets the overall scale of the soft-terms in terms of the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. In order to perform a phenomenological analysis of this scenario one has to follow the renormalization group (RG) evolution of these soft-terms from the GUT to the EW scale and impose the following constraints: a correct REWSB, a higgs mass of order $m_h \simeq 125$ GeV, no DM overproduction and no contradiction with flavour observables and with any experimental result in either particle physics or cosmology.\\

A viable REWSB can be obtained if at the EW scale the following two relations are satisfied:
\begin{align}
\mu^2 = \frac{m_{H_d}^2-m_{H_u}^2 
\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1}-\frac{m_Z^2}{2}\,,
\label{resb1}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
\sin(2\beta)=\frac{2 |B\mu|}{m_{H_d}^2+m_{H_u}^2 + 2\mu^2}\,.
\label{resb2}
\end{align}
Given that the requirement of a correct REWSB fixes only the magnitude of $\mu$ leaving its sign as free, the parameters (\ref{CMSSM}) are typically traded for the standard CMSSM/mSUGRA parameters:
\begin{align}
m = a\ |M|\,,\quad A = b\ M\,,\quad \tan\beta\equiv \frac{\langle H_u^0\rangle}{\langle H_d^0\rangle}\,, \quad {\rm sign}(\mu)\,,
\label{CMSSMparameters}
\end{align}
where one runs $m$, $M$ and $A$ (or $a$, $b$ and $M$ in our case) from the GUT to the EW scale with a particular choice of $\tan\beta$ and sign$(\mu)$. eq.~\eqref{resb1} and \eqref{resb2} then give the value of $B$ and $\mu$
at the EW scale. This is the way in which typical spectrum generators operate.\footnote{Here we use \texttt{SPheno} v3.3.3~\cite{Porod:2003um, Porod:2011nf}.} The boundary values of $B$ and $\mu$ at the GUT scale which give a correct REWSB can be obtained by running back $B$ and $\mu$ from the EW to the GUT scale. In this way we obtain the values of the coefficients $c$ and $d$. In a viable UV model, these values of $c$ and $d$ have to be compatible with the values allowed by the stringy dynamics responsible for SUSY-breaking and the generation of soft-terms. The expressions in eq.~\eqref{resb1} and \eqref{resb2} are tree level relations. We use loop corrections to these relations in our calculations.


\section{Non-thermal CMSSM}
\label{ssec:NTDMCMSSMResults}

As motivated in Sec.~\ref{sec:motivation}, we shall consider scenarios where the LSP is produced non-thermally like in the case of string compactifications where the reheating temperature $T_R$ from the decay of the lightest modulus is generically below the thermal freeze-out temperature~\cite{Acharya:2008bk, Acharya:2009zt, Acharya:2010af, Allahverdi:2013noa}. This reheating temperature represents an additional parameter which has to be supplemented to the standard free parameters of the CMSSM ($a$, $b$, $M$, $\tan\beta$ and the sign of $\mu$). We call this new scenario the `non-thermal CMSSM' which is characterized by the following free parameters: $T_R$, $a$, $b$, the gaugino mass $M$, $\tan \beta$ and the sign of $\mu$.


\subsection{Non-thermal Dark Matter Relic Density}

The abundance of DM particles $\chi$ produced non-thermally by the decay of the lightest modulus is given by~\cite{Moroi:1999zb}:
\begin{align}
\label{dmdens}
\left({n_{\rm DM} \over s}\right)^{\rm NT} = {\rm min} \left[\left({n_{\rm DM} \over s}\right)_{\rm obs} {\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th} \over \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f} \sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({T_f \over T_R}\right), \, Y_{\rm mod}~ {\rm Br}_{\rm DM} \right] \,,
\end{align}
where $g_*$ is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}\simeq 2 \times 10^{-26} {\rm cm}^3\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ is the annihilation rate at the time of freeze-out needed in the thermal case to reproduce the observed DM abundance:
\begin{align}
\left({n_{\rm DM} \over s}\right)_{\rm obs} = \left(\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2\right)_{\rm obs} \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm crit}}{m_{\rm DM} s h^2}\right) \simeq 0.12 \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm crit}}{m_{\rm DM} s h^2}\right),
\label{obs}
\end{align}
whereas the yield of particle abundance from modulus decay is:
\begin{align}
Y_{\rm mod} \equiv {3 T_R \over 4 m_{\rm mod}} \sim \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm mod}}{M_{\rm P}}}\,.
\label{yield}
\end{align}
${\rm Br}_{\rm DM}$ denotes the branching ratio for modulus decays into $R$-parity odd particles which subsequently decay to DM.\\

The expression in eq. \eqref{dmdens} leads to two scenarios for non-thermal DM:
\begin{enumerate}
\item `Annihilation scenario': in this case the DM abundance is given by the first term on the right-hand side of eq.~\eqref{dmdens} and the DM particles undergo some annihilation after their initial production by modulus decay.
In order to avoid DM overabundance one needs
\begin{align}
\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f \geq \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}\,\sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}} \left(\frac{T_f}{T_R}\right)\,.
\end{align}
Given that $T_R < T_f$ and $g_*(T_R) < g_*(T_f)$, this scenario requires $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f > \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}$ as in the case of thermal underproduction. This condition is satisfied by a higgsino- or wino-like LSP but not by a pure bino-like LSP which would generically lead to non-thermal overproduction (apart from the aforementioned cases). However, given that we shall focus on models with just gravity mediated SUSY-breaking (contributions from anomaly mediation are sub-leading) and universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale as in~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}, the LSP can never be wino-like due to the RG running of the gauginos. Bino is the lightest gaugino.  Moreover a wino-like LSP has a significantly larger annihilation cross section than a higgsino-like LSP resulting in a strong conflict with Fermi bounds for sub-TeV wino-like DM~\cite{Cohen:2013ama}. In this context, the `Annihilation scenario' requires a higgsino-like DM. Let us finally point out that the non-thermal DM relic density can be written in terms of the thermal one as:
\begin{align}
\Omega^{\rm NT}_{\rm DM} h^2 = \sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({T_f \over T_R}\right) \Omega^{\rm T}_{\rm DM} h^2\,,
\label{NTdm}
\end{align}
where NT stands for \textit{Non-Thermal}, while T means \textit{Thermal}. For $5$ GeV $< T_f < 80$ GeV (corresponding to $100$ GeV $< m_{\rm DM} < 1.6$ TeV), the top, the higgs, the Z and the W$^\pm$ are not relativistic, giving $g_*(T_f)=86.25$ and:
\begin{align}
\Omega^{\rm NT}_{\rm DM} h^2 = 0.142 \,\sqrt{\frac{10.75}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({m_{\rm DM} \over T_R}\right) \Omega^{\rm T}_{\rm DM} h^2\,.
\label{nonthermaldm}
\end{align}

\item `Branching scenario': in this case the DM abundance is given by the second term on the right-hand side of eq.~\eqref{dmdens} and the DM particles are produced directly from the modulus decay since their residual annihilation is inefficient. In this case both large and small cross sections can satisfy the DM content since the annihilation cross section does not have any impact on the DM content. This scenario is very effective to understand the DM and baryon abundance coincidence problem~\cite{Allahverdi:2010im}. Given that in general we have ${\rm Br}_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{-3}$~\footnote{In this case, the dominant decay mode of moduli is gauge Bosons, ${\phi \rightarrow gg}$. However the gauginos appear in three body final state, i.e., ${\phi\rightarrow g\ \tilde g\tilde g}$  with ${\rm Br}_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{-3}$~\cite{Allahverdi:2010im}.}, in order not to overproduce DM for LSP masses of order hundreds of GeV, one needs $Y_{\rm mod}\lesssim 10^{-9}$. This condition requires a very low reheating temperature:
\begin{align}
T_R\lesssim 10^{-9} m_{\rm mod} = 10^{-9}\kappa^{-1} M_{\rm soft}\,.
\end{align}
For $M_{\rm soft}\sim {O}(1)$ TeV and $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-2}-10^{-4})$ we find $T_R\lesssim {O}(10)$ MeV. In order to obtain such a low reheating temperature one has in general to consider models where the modulus coupling to visible sector fields is loop suppressed~\cite{Allahverdi:2013noa}. However in this case it is very challenging to avoid a large modulus branching ratio into hidden sector light fields like stringy axions~\cite{Cicoli:2015bpq, Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar} and so typically dark radiation is overproduced~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. Therefore the `Branching scenario' does not seem very promising from the phenomenological point of view.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Collider and CMB Constraints}

Due to the considerations mentioned above, if the LSP is bino-like we generically get DM overproduction also in the non-thermal case. The CMSSM boundary condition requires bino to be the lightest among the gauginos. We shall therefore look for particular regions in the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space where the LSP has a non-negligible higgsino component.  We have developed a Monte Carlo programme to find the regions of this parameter space where the LSP is higgsino-like, the higgs mass is around $125.5$ GeV,\footnote{Both ATLAS and CMS give values of the higgs mass between $125$ and $126$ GeV. In what follows,  we will consider ranges of values in this region, allowing to some extent for the uncertainty in the spectrum generators as well. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the higgs mass does not alter the following results qualitatively.} REWSB takes place correctly and the following phenomenological constraints are satisfied: 
\begin{itemize}
\item LEP~\cite{LEP1, LEP2, LEP3, LEP4} and LHC~\cite{Aad:2014wea, Aad:2012hm, Chatrchyan:2012lia, Aad:2014vma, Khachatryan:2014qwa} constraints on neutralino and chargino direct production: $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 100$ GeV;
\item LHC~\cite{Aad:2014wea, Aad:2012hm, Chatrchyan:2012lia, Aad:2014vma, Khachatryan:2014qwa} bounds on gluino and squark masses: $m_{\tilde{g}} \gtrsim 1300$ GeV;
\item LHC constraints from flavour physics: BR$(B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$~\cite{CMS:2014xfa} and the constraint on BR$(b\rightarrow s\gamma)$~\cite{Agashe:2014kda};
\item Planck data on DM relic density~\cite{Ade:2015xua}.
\end{itemize}
To avoid complications with the applicability of the standard \texttt{Spheno} version, we restrict our scan on the following parameter ranges: $\tan\beta=1$ to $55,$ $a=0\,{\rm to}\,10,$ $b=-5\,{\rm to}\,5,$ and the universal gaugino mass at the high scale $M=0.3-3$~TeV. The results are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig3}-\ref{Fig5} for positive $\mu$ (the LSP relic density has been calculated using \verb"micrOMEGAS" v3~\cite{Belanger:2013oya}).\\

\begin{figure}

\caption{Correlation between $a=m/M$ and $b=A/M$ for different LSP compositions (left) and DM thermal relic densities (right) in the region where the LSP is at least 10\% higgsino.}
\label{Fig3}
\end{figure}

The plots in Fig.~\ref{Fig3} show the points surviving the above constraints in the $A/M$-$m/M$ plane (at the GUT scale). The points fit into a V-shaped band illustrating a slight hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses ($m\gtrsim 5 M$) and values of $A$ almost symmetric around $A\simeq M$. The regions shown in the plot are mostly for $T_R$ rather smaller than $T_f$ which keeps mostly the focus point regions in the allowed parameter space. The coannihilation and A-funnel regions can also contribute to the allowed parameter space but they are very fine tuned. The V-shape of our plots is caused by the focus point region which can be obtained by setting $\mu\sim m_Z$ in the EWSB condition with loop corrections. In fact, the dependence of $\mu^2$ on $A$, $M$ and $m$ arises through $m_{H_u}^2$ which depends on the UV soft-terms in the following way: $M^2(f(Q) + g(Q) A/M+ h(Q) (A/M)^2 + e(Q) (m/M)^2)$, where $f$, $g$, $h$ and $e$ depend on dimensionless gauge and Yukawa couplings ($e$ also includes the tadpole correction from the stop loop)  and $Q$ is the SUSY-breaking scale~\cite{Feng:1999zg}. A leading order cancellation in this expression, as needed to achieve a small $\mu$-term in eq. \eqref{resb1}, gives a V-shaped band in the $A/M$-$m/M$ plane. We also apply the higgs mass constraint in this parameter space which depends on the square of $X_t\equiv A_t-\mu \cot\beta$~\cite{Carena:1995bx} and $X_t^2$ preserves the V-shape due to its dependence on $(A/M)^2$.

\label{Fig4}
\end{figure}


To illustrate the allowed parameter range and to illustrate different aspects of the surviving points, we show the following plots (for positive sign of $\mu$):
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Fig.~\ref{Fig3}, the color codes illustrate the percentage of higgsino-like neutralino on the left plot and the neutralino contribution to the thermal DM relic density on the right. Note that in most of the points the neutralinos contribute only a small percentage of the total DM relic density and other DM candidates, such as axions, have to be present. The thermal DM relic density is close to the observed Planck value only in a small region corresponding to an LSP that is approximately 50\% bino and 50\% higgsino. However, as we will see in the next section, after imposing indirect detection constraints from Fermi, the only region which survives is the one where thermal DM is under-abundant (by about 10\% of the observed relic density). On the other hand, as we shall see in the next section, non-thermal higgsino-like DM can lead to larger relic densities which can saturate the Planck value for reheating temperatures around $2$ - $3$ GeV.

\item The color codes in Fig.~\ref{Fig4} illustrate the dependence on $\tan\beta$ on the left plot and different values of gaugino masses on the right plot with well-defined domains for different ranges of gaugino masses inside the V-shaped band. Note that $\tan\beta$ tends to have larger values as expected from the fit of $m_h$ and the parameter ranges in this scan. Smaller values of $A/M$ and $m/M$ are preferred for larger gaugino mass due to RG flow of masses to fit the experimental value of $m_h$.

\item For Fig.~\ref{Fig5} the colors illustrate on the left the different values of the typical scale of SUSY particles $M_{\rm SUSY}$, defined here as the averaged stop mass $M_{\rm SUSY}^2=m_{\tilde{t}_1} m_{\tilde{t}_2}$. Notice that $M_{\rm SUSY}$ is around $4$ - $5$ TeV. In principle, we could explore values larger than $5$ TeV however it would bring us beyond the level of applicability of the spectrum generator \verb"SPheno" we have been using which assume similar values for all soft-terms. An analysis for a Split-SUSY-like case with larger differences between sfermions and gaugino masses would be required in that case but this goes beyond the scope of the analysis of this chapter. The colors on the right plot illustrate the dependence on the higgs mass for which we have taken $m_h=125, 125.5, 126$ GeV respectively. Note that for $m_h=126$ GeV there are allowed points only on the left of the V-shaped band because of the above mentioned cut-off on $M_{\rm SUSY}$. Generally speaking we see that by allowing a larger 
range for the higgs mass, we widen the V-shaped region. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Direct and Indirect Detection Constraints}

In the figures above we have set $\mu>0$ but their pattern does not change for $\mu<0$. The next step is to impose the following phenomenological constraints for the separate case of positive and negative $\mu$ since the DM direct detection cross section depends on sign$(\mu)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fermi bounds on DM indirect detection~\cite{Ackermann:2015tah};
\item IceCube~\cite{Aartsen:2012kia} and XENON100~\cite{Orrigo:2015cha} bounds for spin-dependent DM direct detection;
\item LUX~\cite{Akerib:2013tjd}, CDMS~\cite{Agnese:2013rvf} bounds on spin-independent DM direct detection.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Results for positive} $\mathbf{\mu}$.\\
If we impose the above constraints, indirect detection bounds turn out to be very severe. Using the new Fermi bounds (pass 8 limit) coming from data collected until 2014 (the pass 7 limit includes only data until 2012), we do not find any allowed point for $T_R\lesssim 2$ GeV.

\begin{figure}

and corresponding LSP composition (right) for $m_h = 125.5$ - $126$ GeV and $T_R = 2, 10$ GeV.}
\label{Fig6}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{Fig6} we show the results for different reheating temperatures. The red points show the parameter space where we saturate the DM content measured from Planck~\cite{Ade:2015xua}. We find more allowed points for $T_R=10$ GeV compared to $T_R=2$ GeV since the ratio of $T_f/T_R$ becomes smaller for large $T_R$, and so a smaller annihilation cross section is needed, resulting in a better chance to satisfy the bounds from Fermi. We only see the large higgsino dominated regions for smaller $T_R$ since in this case a larger annihilation cross section is needed to saturate the DM content. For larger $T_R$, an LSP with a smaller higgsino component becomes allowed (higher bino component) and this region appears for smaller values of gaugino mass. We finally mention that the Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM annihilation during the recombination epoch are less stringent than those of Fermi for our scenarios.

Fig.~\ref{Fig7} shows the spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section after imposing LEP, LHC, Planck and Fermi constraints for $T_R = 10$ GeV. IceCube bounds rule out the orange and red regions of the right-hand side plot of Fig.~\ref{Fig7}.

\label{Fig7}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{Fig9} shows the inclusion of LUX bounds on the spin-independent direct detection constraints which rule out most of the points in Fig.~\ref{Fig7} apart from a region corresponding to LSP masses around $300$ GeV which is at the border of detectability.

\label{Fig9}
\end{figure}

Moreover, for $T_R=2$ GeV there are red points which saturate the observed DM content. In this case the neutralinos are becoming more pure higgsinos in order to enhance the annihilation cross section and the Fermi constraint becomes harder to avoid but there are still regions allowed by both direct and indirect detection searches. There are more green points for $T_R=10$ GeV since the annihilation cross section becomes smaller due to bino mixing which means a larger allowed region after using Fermi data but the constraint from the direct detection becomes more stringent (due to bino-higgsino mixing in the LSP) and so there are no red points which saturate the observed DM content.\footnote{The direct detection exclusion however depends on various uncertainties, e.g.~strange quark content of proton, form factor etc.~\cite{Accomando:1999eg}.} For the points shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig9}, the GUT values $c= B/M$ and $d=\mu/M$ are around $0.6$ and $1$ respectively.

\newpage
\item \textbf{Results for negative} $\mathbf{\mu}$.

The results for the negative $\mu$ case are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig10} and~\ref{Fig11}.

\label{Fig10}
\end{figure}

Note that under the same conditions the allowed parameter space for $\mu<0$ is larger than the one for $\mu>0$. This can be understood as follows~\cite{Arnowitt:2001yh, Ellis:2000jd}: $\sigma_{\tilde\chi^0_1-p}$ is dominated by the t-channel $h$, $H$ exchange diagrams which mostly arise from down type (s-quark) interaction:
\begin{align}
A^d\propto m_d\left({\frac{\cos\alpha}{\cos\beta}}{\frac{F_H}{m_H^2}}-{\frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\beta}}{\frac{F_h}{m_h^2}}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the higgs mixing angle, $F_h=(N_{12}-N_{11}\tan\theta_W)(N_{14}\cos\alpha+N_{13}\sin\alpha)$ and $F_H=(N_{12}-N_{11}\tan\theta_W)(N_{14}\sin\alpha-N_{13}\cos\alpha)$ using $\tilde\chi^0_1=N_{11}\tilde B+N_{12}\tilde W+N_{13}\tilde H_1+N_{14}\tilde H_2$. For $\mu<0$, the ratio $N_{14}/N_{13}$ is positive and this amplitude can become small due to cancellations if:
\begin{align}
\frac{N_{14}}{N_{13}}=- {\frac{\tan\alpha+m_h^2/m_H^2 \cot\alpha}{1+m_h^2/m_H^2}}\,,
\end{align}
is satisfied (for $\tan\alpha<0$). In Fig.~\ref{Fig11} there are more allowed points compared to Fig.~\ref{Fig9} even if there are still no points which saturate the observed DM content for $T_R=10$ GeV due to stringent direct detection constraints. For the points shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig11}, the GUT scale values of $B$ and $\mu$ are still both of order $M$.

\section{Discussion of Results}\vspace{-0.1cm}
\label{ssec:DiscussionResults}

\subsection{Analysis of the Allowed Parameter Space}\vspace{-0.1cm}
We are now in a position to put all our results together and explain the effect of each experimental bound on our parameter space. In the end we shall analyze the spectrum of superpartners that appears for the points surviving all the phenomenological constraints. All the observables analyzed in this section have been computed numerically using \verb"micrOMEGAS" v3~\cite{Belanger:2013oya} linked to \verb"SPheno" v3.3.3~\cite{Porod:2003um, Porod:2011nf}.\\

Fig.~\ref{Fig12} shows the relation between the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section and the LSP mass. Depending on $T_R$ there is a different upper bound for neutralino masses which is given by the Planck constraint on DM. For larger values of $T_R$, the non-thermal relic density decreases, and so heavier neutralinos can pass the Planck constraint on the DM relic density. On the other hand, for larger $T_R$ the parameter space for standard thermal DM (orange band) becomes also larger. Note that LUX 2013 results exclude at 90\% most of the parameter space and the next round of results (LUX 300 days) will be able to probe the remaining regions (the light blue points below the LUX line).\\

In the scenario we considered, the gaugino masses are unified at the GUT scale and therefore the evolution of electroweakinos is totally dominated by the RG flow. This implies that the LSP can only be higgsino- or bino-like (or a mixed combination of them). The largest contributions to the thermal averaged annihilation rates are given by (see for example~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb} and references therein):
\begin{align}
\langle \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle = \frac{g_2^4}{512 \pi \mu^2}\left(21 + 3 \tan^2\theta_W +  11 \tan^4\theta_W \right)\,,
\label{sigmamu}
\end{align}
for higgsino-like neutralinos (in the limit $M_W \ll \mu$) annihilating into vector bosons through chargino or neutralino interchange, and:
\begin{align}
\langle  \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle =  \sum_f \frac{g_2^4 \tan^2 \theta_W \left( T_{3_f} - Q_f \right)^4 r (1+r^2)}{2\pi m_{\tilde f}^2(1+r)^4}\,,
\label{sigmab}
\end{align}
for bino-like LSP annihilation into fermion-antifermion ($T_{3_f}$ and $Q_f$ are the third component of isospin and the fermion charge and $r = M_1^2 / m_{\tilde f}^2$). This process is driven at tree level by the t-channel exchange of a slepton ${\tilde f}$. In the case where the LSP is a mixed composition of higgsino and bino, the expression of the annihilation rate is an interpolation between (\ref{sigmamu}) and (\ref{sigmab}).
Fig.~\ref{Fig12} shows also the effect of Fermi bounds. As suggested by Fig. \eqref{sigmamu}) and Fig. \eqref{sigmab}, the most constrained regions are those with smaller LSP masses. The grey band corresponds to points excluded by LEP bounds on chargino direct production.\\

Fig.~\ref{Fig13} shows the amount of non-thermal DM relic density provided by the LSP in terms of its mass, together with the bounds from indirect detection and LUX. The Planck value of the DM content can be saturated in the region which is not ruled out by direct detection bounds only for $T_R = 2$ GeV. Given that for larger $T_R$ the amount of LSP DM gets smaller, the cases with $T_R > 2$ GeV require multi-component DM. Combining Fig.~\ref{Fig12} and Fig.~\ref{Fig13}, we find  that the LUX allowed regions, indirect detection limits and the abundance of LSP DM are correlated for different $T_R$. The allowed regions, where the observed DM content is saturated, depend on $T_R$ but they are generically around $m_{\rm DM} \simeq 300$ GeV.\\

\end{figure}


In Fig.~\ref{Fig14}, we show the Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM annihilation during the recombination epoch. We use $WW$ final states corresponding to an efficiency factor $f_{\rm eff}= 0.2$~\cite{Madhavacheril:2013cna}. Even going all the way to the cosmic variance bound, these constraints turn out to be less stringent than those coming from Fermi and LUX. On the other hand, Fig.~\ref{Fig14} shows the correlation between the LSP composition and the bounds coming from both direct and indirect detection. Concerning Fermi and Planck limits on DM annihilation, these bounds allow almost all possible combinations of bino/higgsino neutralinos. The restrictions coming from the $f \overline{f}$ and $W\overline{W}$ channels depend on the neutralino composition: for a higgsino-like LSP, the most stringent constraint is due to annihilation into vector bosons, while for a bino-like LSP the main constraint comes from annihilation into a fermion-antifermion pair.\\

The LUX constraints in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} reduce the parameter space to the region where the LSP is mostly higgsino-like. This could be a bit puzzling since the WIMP-nucleon cross section is dominated by the higgs exchange channel:
\begin{align}
\sigma_{\chi-p} \propto \frac{a_{\tilde H}^2 (g' a_{\tilde B} - g \ a_{\tilde W})^2}{m_h^4}\,,
\label{xip}
\end{align}
where $a_{\tilde H}$, $a_{\tilde B}$ and $a_{\tilde W}$ are respectively the higgsino, bino and wino LSP components. According to this expression, the cross section is enhanced when the higgsino component increases. However in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} direct detection bounds allow only points which are mainly higgsino-like. The reason of this effect is in the effective coupling $\tilde{\chi} \tilde{\chi}  h$ which for a bino-like LSP looks like:
\begin{align}
C_{\tilde{\chi}\tilde{\chi} h} \simeq \frac{m_Z \sin \theta_W \tan \theta_W}{M_1^2 -\mu^2}\left( M_1 + \mu \sin 2\beta \right)\,,
\label{Cb}
\end{align}
where for moderate to large $\tan \beta$ the second term is negligible and $\mu > M_1$. Hence this coupling is dominated by $M_1$. On the other hand, the coupling for a higgsino-like LSP is:
\begin{align}
C_{\tilde{\chi}\tilde{\chi} h} \simeq \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 \pm \sin 2\beta  \right)\left( \tan^2 \theta_W\frac{m_Z \cos \theta}{M_1 - |\mu|} +\frac{m_Z \cos \theta}{M_2 - |\mu|} \right)\,,
\label{Cn}
\end{align}
where $\pm$ is for the $H_u$ and $H_d$ components and $\mu < M_1$. Contrary to the bino-like case, this coupling is inversely proportional to $M_1$. Thus the WIMP-nucleon cross section grows in the regions where the LSP is higgsino-like and $M_1$ is small or where the LSP is bino-like and the gaugino mass is large. If we compare Fig.~\ref{Fig4} (right) which shows the distribution of gaugino masses along the V-shaped band, with Fig.~\ref{Fig6} (right) and~\ref{Fig10} (right), we realize that the region with a smaller cross section is the one at the bottom of the V-shaped band where gaugino masses are big and the LSP is very higgsino-like. The region where the LSP is more bino-like has smaller gaugino masses and the cross section is larger. Fermi constraints however become more stringent in the case with more higgsino content due to larger annihilation cross section. The competition between LUX and Fermi constraints produces the allowed parameter space where the Planck value of the DM content is saturated for $T_R=2$ GeV.\\

\label{Fig14}
\end{figure}

Finally, in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} there is a change of behavior of the thermal averaged cross section for masses around $130$ GeV. The reason is the following: this region is (as can be shown in the plot) higgsino-like, but the masses are closer to $M_W$ and  $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is no longer described by (\ref{sigmamu}) but by something like (with $x=\mu/m_W$):
\begin{align}
\langle \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle \sim \frac{9g^4}{16 \pi m_W^2} \frac{x^2}{(4x^2-1)^2}\,.
\end{align}
In Fig.~\ref{Fig7a}, we show the spectra of SUSY particles for the allowed regions of Fig.~\ref{Fig9} (blue points below the LUX line). We find that sleptons, staus, higgses, all other scalar masses and gluinos are rather heavy since they are between about $2$ and $7$ TeV. The lightest and second to lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are around $280$-$340$ GeV while all other neutralinos and charginos are heavy. The allowed region for $T_R=2$ GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label $T_R=2$ GeV where the points situated exactly on the line satisfy all the constraints including the current DM content as measured by Planck. Similarly, the allowed region for $T_R\geq 5$ GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label $T_R\geq 5$ GeV even if there are no points in this region which saturate the current DM content. Notice that the spectrum is essentially independent of the reheating temperature $T_R$ and the hierarchy between the different sparticles is 
robust.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Astrophysical Uncertainties}

The direct detection cross section can involve various uncertainties, e.g.~strange quark content of proton, form factor, local DM density and LSP contribution to the total amount of observed DM abundance. The local density can be 0.1-0.7 GeV/cm$^3$~\cite{Read:2014qva}. There could also be astrophysical uncertainties in the indirect detection results beyond what has been considered so far. Recently, it is  mentioned in~\cite{Baer:2015tva, Cahill-Rowley:2013dpa} that if the thermal neutralinos do not produce the entire amount of cold DM, the  direct and indirect detection cross sections should be reduced by $R$ and $R^2$ respectively with $R\equiv \Omega h^2/0.12$. Possible bounds arising from Fermi are now almost negligible since they are suppressed by $R^2$. Once the suppression factor $R$ is taken into account, Fermi, Planck and other indirect detection experiments have lower impacts. Concerning the effect on LUX and other direct detection bounds, the cross section is now reduced by $R$ which is equivalent to multiplying the effective couplings in eq. \eqref{Cb} and eq. \eqref{Cn} by $\sqrt{R}$. This clearly introduces a new parameter in the discussion performed in the previous section.\\

If we assume such a reduction in the cases where $\Omega^{\rm NT}_{\rm DM} h^2\le 0.12$, more parameter space could be allowed for multi-component DM regions as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig15}. The pink region is disallowed by Fermi data. The $T_R$ dependence of the region constrained by Fermi in Fig.~\ref{Fig15} is due to the fact that the  factor R is now a function of $T_R$
\begin{align}
R = \frac{\Omega^{\rm NT}_{\rm DM} h^2}{0.12} \simeq \frac{T_f}{T_R} \frac{\Omega^{\rm T}_{\rm DM} h^2}{0.12}\,.
\end{align}
$R$ becomes larger for smaller values of $T_R$ (=2 GeV) and the Fermi constraint becomes important. The region below the dashed line satisfied present LUX limits. In particular this implies that the region with lighter neutralinos is now unconstrained by LUX. This region typically corresponds to more bino component in the LSP as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig6} (right) and~\ref{Fig10} (right). We have therefore a different situation compared to before, because now neutralinos with a larger bino component are allowed.\\

Let us stress, however, that the prediction for the region where $\Omega^{\rm NT}_{\rm DM} h^2$ saturates the DM content remains unchanged, i.e.~only the case $T_R=2$ GeV contains points which are still allowed by all data and saturate the DM content with an LSP mass around $300$ GeV. This new factor $R$ helps us to extract more parameter space for the multi-component DM scenarios. However, the DM simulations need to establish the validity of  the assumption that proportions of various DM components in the early universe is maintained even after the large scale structures are formed.

\section{Conclusions}

Non-thermal DM scenarios emerge in UV theories like string theory due to the presence of gravitationally coupled scalars which decay at late times when they are dominating the energy density of the universe. In such models the reheating temperature due to moduli decays is typically below the freeze-out temperature, $T_R<T_f$ when assuming an MSSM particle as main DM constituent.\\

In this chapter we have studied the non-thermal version of the CMSSM/mSUGRA and contrasted it with both particle physics and astrophysical experimental constraints. The experimental information available at this moment, including the well known value of the higgs mass, is enough to rule out the vast majority of the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space. There is still a small region which is consistent with all observations and is at the edge of detection by both astrophysics and particle physics experiments, resulting in a very interesting situation for beyond the SM physics.\\

In our determination of the allowed parameter space we have used constraints from collider experiments (LEP, LHC), cosmic microwave background observations (Planck) and direct and indirect DM searches (Fermi, XENON100, IceCube, LUX, CDMS). We have found that the most restrictive constraints come from Fermi and LUX which single out a small region of the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space corresponding to a higgsino-like LSP with a mass around $300$ GeV that can saturate the observed DM abundance for $T_R\simeq 2$~GeV while larger reheating temperatures require additional contributions to the present DM abundance. These results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{Fig13} which shows the comparison between the cases of positive and negative $\mu$.\\

This non-thermal scenario leads to a clear pattern of SUSY particles. In particular, the fact that the LSP is higgsino-like makes the lightest chargino, the lightest neutralino and next to lightest neutralino to be almost degenerate in mass. This kind of scenario can be probed at the LHC using monojet plus soft leptons plus missing energy~\cite{Baer:2014kya, Han:2014kaa}, monojet signal~\cite{Han:2013usa} and two Vector Boson Fusion jets and large missing transverse energy~\cite{Han:2013usa}. On the other hand, all the other superpartners are much heavier and beyond the LHC reach but accessible to potential future experiments such as a $100$ TeV machine.\\

It is worth mentioning that non-thermal CMSSM scenarios with TeV-scale soft-terms and reheating temperatures around $1$ - $10$ GeV can emerge in string models where the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of SUSY-breaking~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In a subset of the parameter range these string scenarios lead to $M_{\rm soft}\sim M_{\rm P} \epsilon^2 \ll m_{\rm mod}\sim M_{\rm P} \epsilon^{3/2} \ll M_{\rm GUT} \sim M_{\rm P} \epsilon^{1/3}$ and $T_R\sim M_{\rm P} \epsilon^{9/4}$ where $\epsilon \simeq m_{3/2}/M_{\rm P}\ll 1$. For $\epsilon \sim 10^{-8}$, one obtains TeV-scale soft-terms, $M_{\rm GUT}\sim 10^{16}$ GeV, $T_R\sim 1 -10$ GeV and $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^6$ GeV for $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV.\\

We point out that our analysis is based on the CMSSM/mSUGRA for which all superpartners are expected to be at similar masses close to the TeV scale. In this sense we restricted ourselves to scalar masses lighter than $5$ TeV which is the range of validity of the codes we have used to perform our analysis.\\

There are several additional ways to generalize the analisys:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider non-universal extensions of the CMSSM. Small departures from universality, even though strongly constrained by flavour changing neutral currents, allow more flexibility in the parameter space and will slightly enhance the allowed region.
\item Consider sfermions heavier than $5$ TeV as in the split-SUSY case. This is not only an interesting phenomenological possibility but is also the other class of scenarios that were derived in the string compactifications studied in~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}.
\item Consider MSSM scenarios with R-parity violation and late decaying moduli fields. This class of models has not been studied in detail and given the fact that even with R-parity conservation there seems to be a need for other sources of DM such as axions or axinos, this should be a possibility worth studying.
\item Consider explicit D-branes models which tend to generate models beyond the standard MSSM (see for instance~\cite{Dolan:2011qu, Maharana:2012tu, Krippendorf:2010hj} for such models).
\end{itemize}

It is encouraging that new planned experiments such as upcoming LUX result and XENON1T will be enough to rule out the rest of the allowed parameter space, independent of the upcoming LHC run. Clearly also new LHC runs and future planned colliders will be crucial for this class of models. Combining astrophysical and collider measurements is probably the most efficient way to constrain beyond the SM physics and the analysis performed in this chapter is a clear illustration of this strategy.

\chapter{Dark Radiation in Sequestered Models}
\label{chap:DR}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:DRIntroduction}

According to the cosmological Standard Model (SM), neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium at early times and decoupled at temperatures of order $1$ MeV. This decoupling left behind a cosmic neutrino background which has been emitted much earlier than the analogous cosmic microwave background (CMB). Due to the weakness of the weak interactions, this cosmic neutrino background cannot be detected directly, and so goes under the name of `dark radiation'. Its contribution to the total energy density $\rho_{\rm tot}$ is parametrized in terms of the effective number of neutrino-like species $N_{\rm eff}$ as:
\begin{align}
\rho_{\rm tot} = \rho_{\gamma} \left( 1 + \frac{7}{8}\left( \frac{4}{11} \right)^{4/3} N_{\rm eff} \right)\,.
\end{align}
The SM predictions for $N_{\rm eff}$ are $N_{\rm eff}=3$ during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and $N_{\rm eff}=3.046$ at CMB times since neutrinos get slightly reheated when electrons and positrons annihilate. Any departure from these values would be a clear signal of physics beyond the SM due to the presence of extra dark radiation controlled by the parameter $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\equiv N_{\rm eff} - N_{\rm eff, SM}$.\\

Given that $N_{\rm eff}$ is positively correlated with the present value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, the comparison between indirect estimates of $H_0$ from CMB experiments and direct astrophysical measurements of $H_0$ could signal the need for extra dark radiation. The Planck 2013 value of the Hubble constant is $H_0 = (67.3\pm 1.2)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL)~\cite{Ade:2013zuv} which is in tension at $2.5\sigma$ with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) value $H_0 = (73.8\pm 2.4)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL)~\cite{Riess:2011yx}. Hence the Planck 2013 estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ with this HST `$H_0$ prior' is $N_{\rm eff} = 3.62^{+0.50}_{-0.48}$ ($95\%$ CL) which is more than $2\sigma$ away from the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 1.07$ at $2\sigma$.\\

However the HST Cepheid data have been reanalyzed by~\cite{Efstathiou:2013via} who found the different value $H_0 = (70.6\pm 3.3)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) which is within $1\sigma$ of the Planck 2015 estimate $H_0 = (67.3\pm 1.0)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL)~\cite{Ade:2015xua}. Hence the Planck 2015 collaboration performed a new estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ without using any `$H_0$ prior' and obtaining $N_{\rm eff} = 3.13 \pm 0.32$ ($68\%$ CL)~\cite{Ade:2013zuv} which is perfectly consistent with the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 0.72$ at around $2\sigma$. This result might seem to imply that extra dark radiation is ruled out but this naive interpretation can be misleading since larger $N_{\rm eff}$ corresponds to larger $H_0$ and there is still an unresolved controversy in the direct measurement of $H_0$. In fact the Planck 2015 paper~\cite{Ade:2015xua} analyzes also the case with the prior $\Delta N_{\rm eff}=0.39$ obtaining the result $H_0 = (70.6\pm 1.0)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) which is even in better agreement with the new HST estimate of $H_0$ performed in~\cite{Efstathiou:2013via}. Thus we stress that trustable direct astrophysical measurements of $H_0$ are crucial in order to obtain reliable bounds on $N_{\rm eff}$.\\

$N_{\rm eff}$ is also constrained by measurements of primordial light element abundances. The Planck 2015 estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ based on the helium primordial abundance and combined with the measurements of~\cite{Aver:2013wba} is $N_{\rm eff}= 3.11^{+0.59}_{-0.57}$ ($95\%$ CL) giving $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 0.65$ at $2\sigma$~\cite{Ade:2015xua}. However measurements of light element abundances are difficult and often affected by systematic errors, and so also in this case there is still some controversy in the literature since~\cite{Izotov:2014fga} reported a larger helium abundance that, in turn, leads to $N_{\rm eff}= 3.58 \pm 0.50$ ($99\%$ CL) which is $3\sigma$ away from the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 1.03$ at $3\sigma$. Due to all these experimental considerations, in the rest of this chapter we shall consider $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$ as a reference upper bound for the presence of extra dark radiation.\\

Extra neutrino-like species can be produced in any beyond the SM theory which features hidden sectors with new relativistic degrees of freedom (\textit{dof}). In particular, extra dark radiation is naturally generated when reheating is driven by the decay of a gauge singlet since in this case there is no a priori good reason to suppress the branching ratio into hidden sector light particles~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Higaki:2013lra}. \\

This situation is reproduced in string models of the early universe due to the presence of gravitationally coupled moduli which get displaced from their minimum during inflation, start oscillating when the Hubble scale reaches their mass, quickly come to dominate the energy density of the universe since they redshift as matter and finally reheat the universe when they decay~\cite{Acharya:2008bk, Acharya:2009zt, Acharya:2010af, Allahverdi:2013noa}. In the presence of many moduli, the crucial one is the lightest since its decay dilutes any previous relic produced by the decay of heavier moduli.\\

Two important cosmological constraints have to be taken into account: (i) the lightest modulus has to decay before BBN in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions for the light element abundances~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci, Banks:1993en, deCarlos:1993wie}; (ii) the modulus decay to gravitinos should be suppressed in order to avoid problems of DM overproduction because of gravitinos annihilation or modifications of BBN predictions~\cite{Endo:2006zj, Nakamura:2006uc}. The first constraint sets a lower bound on the lightest modulus mass of order $m_{\rm mod} \gtrsim 100$ TeV, while a straightforward way to satisfy the second constraint is $m_{\rm mod}< 2 m_{3/2}$.\\

However in general in string compactifications the moduli develop a mass because of SUSY-breaking effects which make the gravitino massive via the super higgs mechanism and generate also soft-terms of order $M_{\rm soft}$. Because of their common origin, one has therefore $m_{\rm mod}\sim m_{3/2}\sim M_{\rm soft}$. The cosmological lower bound $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 100$ TeV then pushes the soft-terms well above the TeV-scale ruining the solution of the hierarchy problem based on low-energy SUSY. An intriguing way-out is given by Type IIB string compactifications where the visible sector is constructed via fractional D3-branes at singularities~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa, Conlon:2008wa, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha}. In this case the blow-up modulus resolving the singularity is fixed at zero size in a supersymmetric manner, resulting in the absence of local SUSY-breaking effects. SUSY is instead broken by bulk moduli far away from the visible sector singularity. Because of this geometric separation, the visible sector is said to be `sequestered' since the soft-terms can be suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass by $\epsilon = \frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}\ll 1$~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}.\\

A concrete example of sequestered SUSY-breaking is given by the Type IIB LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) with D3-branes at singularities, which is characterized by the following hierarchy of masses~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}:
\begin{align}
M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \epsilon \ll m_{\rm mod} \sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon} \ll m_{3/2}\,.
\label{masses}
\end{align}
This mass spectrum guarantees the absence of moduli decays to gravitinos and allows for gaugino masses $M_{1/2}$ around the TeV-scale for $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^7$ GeV and $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. On the other hand, SUSY scalar masses $m_0$ are more model-dependent since their exact $\epsilon$-dependence is determined by the form of the K\"ahler metric for visible sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. The general analysis of Chap. \ref{chap:Soft-Terms} ~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa} found two possible $\epsilon$-scalings for scalar masses: (i) $m_0\sim M_{1/2}$ corresponding to a typical MSSM-like scenario and (ii) $m_0 \sim m_{\rm mod} \gg M_{1/2}$ resulting in a Split-SUSY-like case with heavy squarks and sleptons.\\

Following the cosmological evolution of these scenarios, reheating takes place due to the decay of the volume modulus which produces, together with visible sector particles, also hidden sector \textit{dof} which could behave as extra dark radiation~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}. Some hidden sector \textit{dof} are model-dependent whereas others, like bulk closed string axions, are always present, and so give a non-zero contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. In fact, as shown in~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}, the production of axionic dark radiation is unavoidable in any string model where reheating is driven by the moduli decay and some of the moduli are stabilized by perturbative effects which keep the corresponding axions light. Note that light closed string axions can be removed from the low-energy spectrum via the St\"uckelberg mechanism only for cycles collapsed to zero size since in the case of cycles in the geometric regime the combination of axions eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$ is mostly given by open string axions~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}.\\

R-parity odd visible sector particles produced from the lightest modulus decay subsequently decay to the lightest SUSY particle, which is one of the main DM candidates. Due to their common origin, axionic dark radiation and neutralino DM have an interesting correlation~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. In fact, by combining present bounds on $N_{\rm eff}$ with lower bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$ as a function of the DM mass $m_\DM$ from recent Fermi data, one can set interesting constraints on the $(N_{\rm eff}, m_\DM)$-plane.~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa} found that standard thermal DM is allowed only if $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\to 0$ while the vast majority of the allowed parameter space requires non-thermal scenarios with higgsino-like DM, in agreement with the results of~\cite{Aparicio:2015sda} for the MSSM-like case.\\

Dark radiation production for the MSSM-like case has been studied in~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar} which showed that the leading decay channels of the volume modulus are to visible sector higgses via the Giudice-Masiero (GM) term and to ultra-light bulk closed string axions. The simplest model with two higgs doublets and a shift-symmetric higgs sector yields $1.53 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1.60$, where the window has been obtained by varying the reheating temperature between $500$ MeV and $5$ GeV, which are typical values for gravitationally coupled scalars with masses in the range $m_{\rm mod}\simeq (1 \div 5) \cdot 10^7$ GeV. These values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ lead to dark radiation overproduction since they are in tension with current observational bounds.\footnote{Radiative corrections to the modulus coupling to higgs fields do not give rise to a significant change in the final prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$~\cite{Angus:2013zfa}.} Possible way-outs to reduce $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ involve models with either a larger GM coupling or more than two higgs doublets.\\

Due to this tension with dark radiation overproduction, different models have been studied in the literature.~\cite{Angus:2014bia} showed how sequestered LVS models where the CY volume is controlled by more than one divisor are ruled out since they predict huge values of extra dark radiation of order $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\sim 10^4$. On the other hand,~\cite{Hebecker:2014gka} focused on non-sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is realized via D7-branes wrapping the large cycle controlling the CY volume.\footnote{Another option involves flavour D7-branes wrapped around the volume divisor and intersecting the visible sector D3-branes localized at a singularity~\cite{Hebecker:2014gka}.} In this way, the decay rate of the lightest modulus to visible sector gauge bosons becomes comparable to the decay to bulk axions, and so the prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can become smaller. In fact, the simplest model with a shift-symmetric higgs sector yields $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq 0.5$~\cite{Hebecker:2014gka}. However this case necessarily requires high-scale SUSY since without sequestering $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}$ (up to loop factors), and so from~\eqref{masses} we see that the cosmological bound $m_{\rm mod}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}\gtrsim 100$ TeV implies $M_{\rm soft} \sim m_{3/2} \gtrsim \left(100\,{\rm TeV}\right)^{2/3} M_{\rm P}^{1/3}\sim 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. Moreover in this case the visible sector gauge coupling is set by the CY volume ${V}$, $\alpha_\SM^{-1} \sim {V}^{2/3} \sim 25$, and so it is hard to achieve large values of ${V}$ without introducing a severe fine-tuning of some underlying parameters. A possible way-out could be to consider anisotropic compactifications where the CY volume is controlled by a large divisor and a small cycle which supports the visible sector~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg, Cicoli:2011yy, Angus:2012dd}.\\

In this chapter we take instead a different point of view and keep focusing on sequestered models of Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms}~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}, since they are particularly promising for phenomenological applications: they are compatible with TeV-scale SUSY and gauge coupling unification without suffering from any cosmological moduli and gravitino problem, they can be embedded in globally consistent CY compactifications~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha} and allow for successful inflationary models~\cite{Conlon:2005jm, Burgess:2013sla, Cicoli:2011zz} and neutralino non-thermal DM phenomenology~\cite{Aparicio:2015sda}. Following the general analysis of SUSY-breaking and its mediation to the visible sector performed in Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms}~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa} for sequestered Type IIB LVS models with D3-branes at singularities, we focus on the Split-SUSY case where squarks and sleptons acquire a mass of order the lightest modulus mass: $m_0 = c\, m_{\rm mod}$ with $c\sim {O}(1)$. We compute the exact value of the coefficient $c$ for different Split-SUSY cases depending on the form of the K\"ahler metric for visible sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. We find that the condition $c\leq 1/2$, which allows the new decay channel to SUSY scalars, can be satisfied only by including string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential~\cite{Cicoli:2007xp, Berg:2007wt}. However this relation holds only at the string scale $M_s \sim 10^{15}$ GeV whereas the decay of the lightest modulus takes place at an energy of order its mass $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^7$ GeV. Hence we consider the Renormalization Group (RG) running of the SUSY scalar masses from $M_s$ to $m_{\rm mod}$ and then compare their value to $m_{\rm mod}$ whose running is in practice negligible since moduli have only gravitational couplings. Given that also the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible effect in Split-SUSY-like models, we find that radiative corrections do not alter the parameter space region where the lightest modulus decay to SUSY scalars opens up.\\

We then compute the new predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ which gets considerably reduced with respect to the MSSM-like case considered in~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar} since the branching ratio to visible sector particles increases due to the new decay to squarks and sleptons and the new contribution to the decay to higgses from their mass term. We find that the simplest model with a shift-symmetric higgs sector can suppress $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ to values as small as $0.14$ in perfect agreement with current experimental bounds. Depending on the exact value of $m_0$ all values in the range $0.14 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1.6$ are allowed. Interestingly $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can be within the allowed experimental window also in the case of vanishing GM coupling $Z = 0$ since the main suppression of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ comes from the lightest modulus decay to squarks and sleptons. Given that a correct realization of radiative EWSB in Split-SUSY-like models requires in general a large $\mu$-term of order $m_0$, the lightest modulus branching ratio into visible sector \textit{dof} is also slightly increased due to its decay to higgsinos. However this new decay channel yields just a negligible correction to the final prediction for dark radiation production.\\

In Sec.~\ref{drs} we analyze the predictions for axionic dark radiation. We present our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{Concl}. This chapter is based on~\cite{Cicoli:2015bpq}.

\section{Dark Radiation in Sequestered Models}
\label{drs}

As already argued in Sec. \ref{sec:DRIntroduction}, the production of dark radiation is a generic feature of string models where some of the moduli are fixed by perturbative effects~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. In fact, if perturbative corrections fix the real part of the modulus $T=\tau + {\rm i}\psi$, the axion $\psi$ remains exactly massless at this level of approximation due to its shift-symmetry, leading to $m_\tau \gg m_\psi$. Hence very light relativistic axions can be produced by the decay of $\tau$, giving rise to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \neq 0$. 

\subsection{Dark Radiation from Moduli Decays}

Following the cosmological evolution of the Universe, during inflation the canonically normalized modulus $\Phi$ gets a displacement from its late-time minimum of order $M_{\rm P}$. After the end of inflation the value of the Hubble parameter $H$ decreases. When $H \sim m_\Phi$, $\Phi$ starts oscillating around its minimum and stores energy. During this stage $\Phi$ redshifts as matter, so that it quickly comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe. Afterwards reheating is caused by the decay of $\Phi$ which takes place when:
\begin{align}
3 H^2 \simeq \frac43 \,\Gamma_\Phi^2\,,
\label{HG}
\end{align}
where $\Gamma_\Phi$ is the total decay rate into visible and hidden \textit{dof}:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_\Phi = \Gamma_{\rm vis} + \Gamma_{\rm hid} = \left(c_{\rm vis} + c_{\rm vis}\right) \Gamma_0\,,\qquad\text{with} \qquad \Gamma_0~\equiv \frac{1}{48\pi}\frac{m_\Phi^3}{M_{\rm P}^2}\,.
\label{G}
\end{align}
The corresponding reheating temperature is given by:
\begin{align} 
T_{\rm rh} = \left(\frac{30\,\rho_{\rm vis}}{\pi^2 g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{\frac 14}\,,
\label{Trh}
\end{align}
where $\rho_{\rm vis} = \left(c_{\rm vis}/c_{\rm tot}\right) 3 H^2 M_{\rm P}^2$ with $c_{\rm tot}=c_{\rm vis} + c_{\rm hid}$. 
Using~\eqref{HG} and~\eqref{G} $T_{\rm rh}$ can be rewritten as:
\begin{align}
T_{\rm rh} \simeq \frac{1}{\pi} \left(\frac{5 c_{\rm vis} c_{\rm tot}}{288 g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{1/4} m_\Phi\,\sqrt{\frac{m_\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}}\,.
\label{rt}
\end{align}
This reheating temperature has to be larger than about $1$ MeV in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions.\\

In the presence of a non-zero branching ratio for $\Phi$ decays into hidden sector \textit{dof}, i.e. for $c_{\rm hid}\neq 0$, extra axionic dark radiation gets produced, leading to~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}:
\begin{align}
\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{43}{7} \frac{c_{\rm hid}}{c_{\rm vis}} \left(\frac{g_*(T_{\rm dec})}{g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{1/3}\,,
\label{dn}
\end{align}
where $T_{\rm dec} \simeq 1$ MeV is the temperature of the Universe at neutrino decoupling with $g_*(T_{\rm dec}) = 10.75$. 
The factor in brackets is due to the fact that axions are very weakly coupled (they are in practice only gravitationally coupled), and so they never reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, given that the comoving entropy density $g_*(T) T^3 a^3$ is conserved, the thermal bath gets slightly reheated when some species drop out of thermal equilibrium. Note that the observational reference bound $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$ implies:
\begin{align}
c_{\rm vis}\gtrsim 3\, c_{\rm hid}\qquad\text{for}\qquad T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 0.2\,\text{GeV}\,,
\label{cbound}
\end{align}
where we have used the fact that $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 75.75$ in the window $0.2\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 0.7\, {\rm GeV}$ while $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 86.25$ for $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 0.7\,\rm GeV$.

\subsection{Light Relativistic Axions in LVS Models}

Let us summarize the main reasons why axionic dark radiation production is a typical feature of sequestered LVS models:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reheating is driven by the last modulus to decay which is $\tau_b$ since the moduli mass spectrum takes the form (the axion $\psi_\SM$ is eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$):
\begin{align}
m_{\tau_b}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon} \ll m_{\tau_s} \sim m_{\psi_s} \sim m_S \sim m_U \sim m_{3/2} \ll m_{\tau_\SM} \sim \frac{m_{3/2}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\sim M_s\,,
\end{align}
where $\epsilon = m_{3/2}/M_{\rm P} \sim W_0 / {V} \ll 1$. Given that gaugino masses scale as $M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \epsilon$, TeV-scale SUSY fixes $m_{\tau_b}$ around $10^7$ GeV which in turn, using~\eqref{rt}, gives $T_{\rm rh}$ around $1$ GeV.\footnote{As in standard Split-SUSY models, we require TeV-scale gauginos for DM and gauge coupling unification. In MSSM-like models we focus on low-energy SUSY to address the hierarchy problem.} Note that $m_{\tau_b}\ll m_{3/2}$, and so sequestering addresses the gravitino problem since the decay of the volume modulus into gravitinos is kinematically forbidden.

\item Given that axions enjoy shift symmetries which are broken only by non-perturbative effects, the axionic partner $\psi_b$ of the volume mode $\tau_b$ is stabilized by non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential of the form $W \supset A_b\, e^{- a_b T_b} \sim e^{-{V}^{2/3}}\ll 1$. These tiny effects give rise to a vanishingly small mass $m_{\psi_b}^2 \sim e^{- {V}^{2/3}} \sim 0$. Hence these bulk closed string axions are in practice massless and can be produced from the decay of $\tau_b$~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}. 

\item Some closed string axions can be removed from the 4D spectrum via the St\"uckelberg mechanism in the process of anomaly cancellation. However, the combination of bulk axions eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$ is mostly given by an open string mode, and so $\psi_b$ survives in the low-energy theory (the situation is opposite for axions at local singularities)~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Volume Modulus Decay Channels}

The aim of this section is to compute the ratio $c_{\rm hid}/c_{\rm vis}$ which is needed to predict the effective number of extra neutrino-like species $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ using (\ref{dn}).

\subsubsection{Decays into Hidden Sector Fields}
\label{vmds}

Some hidden sector \textit{dof} are model-dependent whereas others are generic features of LVS models. As pointed out above, bulk closed string axions are always a source of dark radiation. On top of them, there are local closed string axions which however tend to be eaten up by anomalous $U(1)$s (this is always the case for each del Pezzo singularity) and local open string axions (one of them could be the QCD axion~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha}) whose production from $\tau_b$ decay is negligibly small~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq}. Moreover the decay of $\tau_b$ into bulk closed string $U(1)$s is also a sub-dominant effect~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq}. Model-dependent decay channels involve light \textit{dof} living on hidden D7-branes wrapping either $D_b$ or $D_s$ and hidden D3-branes at singularities which are geometrically separated from the one where the visible sector is localized. However, as explained in~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq}, the only decay channels which are not volume or loop suppressed are to light gauge bosons on the large cycle and to higgses living on sequestered D3s different from the visible sector. Given that the presence of these states is non-generic and can be avoided by suitable hidden sector model building, we shall focus here just on $\tau_b$ decays into 
bulk closed string axions.\\

The corresponding decay rate takes the form~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq,Higaki:2012ar}: 
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow a a} = \Gamma_0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad c_{\rm hid}=1\,,
\label{ddr}
\end{align}
where $\Phi$ and $a$ are, respectively, the canonically normalized real and imaginary parts of the big modulus $T_b$.
This result can be derived from the tree-level K\"ahler potential:
\begin{align}
K \simeq - 3 \ln\left(\frac{T_b+\overline{T}_b}{2}\right)\,,
\end{align}
which gives a kinetic lagrangian of the form:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac{3}{4 \tau_b^2} \left(\partial_\mu \tau_b \partial^\mu \tau_b + \partial_\mu \psi_b \partial^\mu \psi_b\right)\,.
\label{lag1}
\end{align}
After canonical normalization of $\tau_b$ and $\psi_b$:
\begin{align}
\label{cn1}
\frac{\Phi}{M_{\rm P}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \ln \tau_b\,, \qquad \qquad \frac{a}{M_{\rm P}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{\psi_b}{\langle \tau_b \rangle}\,,
\end{align}
and expanding $\Phi$ as $\Phi = \Phi_0 + \hat \Phi$, the kinetic lagrangian~\eqref{lag1} can be rewritten as:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac 12 \partial_\mu \hat\Phi \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \frac 12 \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a - \sqrt{\frac 23 } \frac{\hat \Phi}{M_{\rm P}} \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a\,,
\end{align}
which encodes the coupling of the volume modulus to its axionic partner. Integrating by parts and using the equation of motion 
$\Box \hat \Phi = - m_\Phi^2 \hat \Phi$ we obtain the coupling:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\Phi a a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_{\rm P}} \hat\Phi a a\,,
\label{lphiaa}
\end{align}
which yields the decay rate~\eqref{ddr}.

\subsubsection{Decays into Visible Sector Fields}

The dominant volume modulus decays into visible sector \textit{dof} are to higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. Additional leading order decay channels can be to SUSY scalars and higgsinos depending respectively on $m_0$ and $\hat\mu$. On the other hand, as explained in~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq,Higaki:2012ar}, $\tau_b$ decays into visible gauge bosons are loop suppressed, i.e. $c_{\Phi\to A A}\sim \alpha_\SM^2 \ll 1$, whereas decays into matter fermions and gauginos are chirality suppressed, i.e. $c_{\Phi\to f f}\sim \left(m_f/m_\Phi\right)^2 \ll 1$. The main goal of this section is to compute the cubic interaction lagrangian which gives rise to the decay of the volume modulus into higgses, higgsinos, squarks and sleptons.

\subsubsection*{Decay into Scalar Fields}

Let us first focus on the volume modulus decays into visible scalar fields which are induced by the $\tau_b$-dependence of both kinetic and mass terms in the total effective lagrangian ${L} = {L}_{\rm kin} - V$. ${L}_{\rm kin}$ is determined by the leading order K\"ahler potential:
\begin{align}
K \simeq - 3 \ln\left(\frac{T_b+\overline{T}_b}{2}\right) + \frac{2}{T_b + \overline{T}_b} \left[f_\alpha(U,S) \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} C^\alpha + \left(Z H_u H_d + \rm h.c.\right)\right]\,,
\end{align}
where we included only the leading term of the K\"ahler matter metric $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ in~\eqref{mattermetric}. 
Writing each complex scalar field as $C^\alpha = \frac{\rm{Re} C^\alpha + i \rm{Im} C^\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}$, 
the canonically normalized real scalar fields look like:
\begin{align}
h_1 = \lambda_u {\rm Re} H_u^+ \qquad h_2 = \lambda_d {\rm Re} H_d^-
\qquad h_3 = \lambda_d {\rm Re} H_d^0 \qquad h_4 = \lambda_u {\rm Re} H_u^0  \nonumber\\ \\
h_5 = \lambda_d {\rm Im} H_d^0  \qquad h_6 = \lambda_u {\rm Im} H_u^0 
\qquad h_7 = \lambda_u {\rm Im} H_u^+  \qquad h_8 = \lambda_d {\rm Im} H_d^- \nonumber\\ \\
\sigma_\alpha = \lambda_\alpha {\rm Re} C_\alpha \qquad \chi_\alpha = \lambda_\alpha {\rm Im} C_\alpha
\qquad\text{where}\qquad \lambda_i\equiv \sqrt{\frac{f_i(U,S)}{\langle \tau_b\rangle}}\,.
\label{fields}
\end{align}
Keeping only terms which are at most cubic in the fields and neglecting axion-scalar-scalar interactions, we can schematically 
write the kinetic lagrangian as ${L}_{\rm kin} = {L}_{\rm{kin, quad}} + {L}_{\rm{kin, cubic}}$ where:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm{kin, quad}} = \frac 12 \partial_\mu \hat\Phi \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \frac 12 \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a 
+ \frac 12 \partial_\mu h_i \partial^\mu h^i + \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \sigma_\alpha \partial^\mu \sigma^\alpha 
+ \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \chi_\alpha \partial^\mu \chi^\alpha\,, \nonumber\\
\end{align}
while the cubic part can be further decomposed as ${L}_{\rm{kin, cubic}} = {L}_{\Phi a a} + {L}_{\Phi h h} + {L}_{\Phi C C}$, 
with ${L}_{\Phi aa}$ given in~\eqref{lphiaa} and:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\Phi h h} =  - \frac{1}{M_{\rm P}\sqrt{6}} \left[\partial_\mu \hat\Phi h_i\partial^\mu h^i + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu h_i \partial^\mu h^i
+Z\partial_\mu \hat\Phi \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}\left(h_{2i}\partial^\mu h_{2i-1} + h_{2i-1}\partial^\mu h_{2i} \right)\right], \nonumber\\
\end{align}
and:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\Phi C C} = - \frac{1}{M_{\rm P}\sqrt{6}} \left(\sigma_\alpha \partial_\mu \sigma^\alpha \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \chi_\alpha \partial_\mu \chi^\alpha \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu \sigma_\alpha \partial^\mu \sigma^\alpha + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu \chi_\alpha \partial^\mu \chi^\alpha\right)\,. \nonumber\\
\end{align}
In addition to the LVS part, the scalar potential contains also the following terms:
\begin{align}
\label{sp1}
V \supset \frac{1}{2}  m^2_0 \left( \sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha \right) 
+ \frac 12 \left(\hat{\mu}^2+m_0^2\right) h_i h^i + B\hat{\mu} \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\,.
\end{align}
Since the soft-terms depend on the volume modulus, we can expand them as:
\begin{align}
\label{stexp}
\hat{\mu}^2\propto \tau_b^{-\alpha}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \hat{\mu}^2(\hat\Phi) = \hat{\mu}^2 \left(1-\alpha \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\right)\,, \nonumber\\ \\
m_0^2 \propto \tau_b^{-\beta}\quad\Rightarrow\quad m_0^2(\hat\Phi) = m_0^2 \left(1-\beta \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\right)\,, \nonumber\\ \\
B\hat{\mu} \propto \tau_b^{-\gamma}\quad\Rightarrow\quad B\hat{\mu} (\hat\Phi) = B\hat{\mu} \left(1-\gamma \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ depend on the specific scenario. This expansion leads to new cubic interactions coming from the terms of the scalar potential in~\eqref{sp1}:
\begin{align}
V\supset - \frac{1}{M_{\rm P}\sqrt{6}} &\left[\gamma m_0^2 \, \hat\Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha  + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha\right) 
+\left(\alpha \hat{\mu}^2 + \beta m_0^2 \right) \, \hat \Phi h_i h^i + \right. \nonumber \\
+& \left. 2 \gamma B\hat{\mu} \, \hat \Phi \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right]. \nonumber\\
\end{align}
Including the relevant cubic interactions coming from the kinetic lagrangian and integrating by parts, we obtain a total cubic lagrangian of the form:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm cubic} = \frac{1}{M_{\rm P}\sqrt{6}} \left[ \hat \Phi h_i \Box h^i + \hat \Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha \Box \sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha \Box \chi^\alpha \right) + \left(\alpha \hat{\mu}^2 + \beta m_0^2 \right) \, \hat \Phi h_i h^i\right. + \nonumber\\ \\
+ \left. \gamma m_0^2 \, \hat \Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha\right)+\left(Z \Box \hat \Phi + 2\gamma B\hat{\mu} \, \hat\Phi\right) \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right]. \nonumber\\
\end{align}
The leading order expressions of the equations of motion are:
\begin{align}
\Box \sigma_\alpha = - m_0^2 \sigma_\alpha \qquad 
\Box h_{2i-1} =  - \left(\hat{\mu}^2 + m_0^2 \right) h_{2i-1} + (-1)^i B\hat{\mu} \, h_{2i} \quad i=1,\dots,4 \nonumber\\ \\
\Box \chi_\alpha = - m_0^2 \chi_\alpha \qquad
\Box h_{2j} =  - \left(\hat{\mu}^2 + m_0^2 \right) h_{2j} + (-1)^j B\hat{\mu} \, h_{2j-1} \quad j=1,\dots,4 \,, \nonumber\\
\end{align}
which have to be supplemented with:
\begin{align}
\Box \hat \Phi = - m_{\Phi}^2 \hat \Phi \qquad \qquad \Box a = - m_a^2 a \simeq 0\,.
\end{align}
Plugging these equations of motion into ${L}_{\rm cubic}$, the final result becomes:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm cubic} = - \frac{1}{M_{\rm P}\sqrt{6}} &\left[\left(\hat{\mu}^2 \left(1 - \alpha\right) + m_0^2 \left(1 - \beta \right)\right) \, \hat\Phi h_i h^i 
+ (1 - \gamma) m_0^2 \, \hat \Phi \left(\sigma^\alpha\sigma_\alpha + \chi^\alpha\chi_\alpha\right)\right. \nonumber\\ \\

\label{finallagr}
\end{align}
from which it is easy to find the corresponding decay rates using the fact that: 
\begin{align}
{L}_1 = \lambda \frac{m^2}{M_{\rm P}}\Phi \phi \phi \quad\Rightarrow \quad
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \phi \phi} = \lambda_1 \Gamma_0 \,,\quad \lambda_1 = 6\lambda^2\left(\frac{m}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^4 \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_\phi}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^2}\,, \label{dw1} \\
{L}_2 = \lambda \frac{m^2}{M_{\rm P}}\Phi \phi_1 \phi_2\,\,\Rightarrow \,\,
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \phi_1 \phi_2} = \lambda_2 \Gamma_0\,, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2}\,\,\text{for}\,\, m_{\phi_1} = m_{\phi_2} = m_\phi\,.
\label{dw2}
\end{align}

\subsubsection*{Decay into Higgsinos}

The decay of the volume modulus into higgsinos is determined by expanding the higgsino kinetic and mass terms around the VEV of $\tau_b$ and then working with canonically normalized fields. The relevant terms in the low-energy lagrangian are:
\begin{align}
{L} \supset i \tilde{H}^{\dagger}_i \overline{\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \tilde{H}^{i} \left(1-\sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\right)- \frac{\hat\mu}{2} \left(\tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^- - \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0\right)\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{6}} \frac{\hat\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\right) +\text{h.c.} \,.
\end{align}
After imposing the equations of motion, we get the following cubic interaction lagrangian:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm cubic} \supset \, \frac{\alpha}{2 \sqrt{6}} \, \frac{\hat\mu}{M_{\rm P}} \,\hat\Phi \left(\tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^- - \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0\right)+\text{h.c.}\,.
\label{higgsinocubic}
\end{align}
The corresponding decay rates take the form:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^-} = \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2 \left(1 - 4 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2\right)^{3/2} \Gamma_0 \,.
\label{higgsinosdr}
\end{align}

\subsection{Dark Radiation Predictions}

It is clear from~\eqref{finallagr} and~\eqref{higgsinosdr} that the volume modulus branching ratio into visible sector \textit{dof} depends on the size of the soft-terms. Hence the final prediction for dark radiation production has to be studied separately for each different visible sector construction. 

\subsubsection{MSSM-like Case}

Firstly we consider MSSM-like models arising from the ultra-local dS$_2$ case where all soft-terms are suppressed relative to the volume modulus mass:
\begin{align}
m_0^2 \simeq M_{1/2}^2 \simeq B\hat{\mu} \simeq \hat{\mu}^2 \sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{{V}^4} \ll m_{\Phi}^2 \sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{{V}^3}\,.
\end{align}
Let us briefly review the results for dark radiation production which for this case have already been studied in~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}. 

Given that all soft-terms are volume-suppressed with respect to $m_\Phi$, only the last term in~\eqref{finallagr} gives a non-negligible contribution to the volume modulus branching ratio into visible sector fields. Thus the leading $\Phi$ decay channel is to MSSM higgses via the GM coupling. Using~\eqref{dw2}, we find:  
\begin{align}
\label{phihh1}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_{\rm vis}\Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_{\rm vis}= 4\times\frac{Z^2}{2} \sqrt{1 - 4\,\frac{(\hat\mu^2+m_0^2)}{m_\Phi^2}} \simeq 2 Z^2\,.
\end{align}
Plugging this value of $c_{\rm vis}$ together with $c_{\rm hid}=1$ (see~\eqref{ddr}) into the general expression~\eqref{dn} for extra dark radiation, we obtain the window:
\begin{align}
\frac{1.53}{Z^2}\lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim  \frac{1.60}{Z^2}\,,
\label{MSSMpred}
\end{align}
for $0.2 \, {\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 10 \, {\rm GeV}$. Clearly this gives values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ larger than unity for $Z = 1$. Using the bound~\eqref{cbound}, we see that we need $c_{\rm vis}\gtrsim 3$ in order to be consistent with present observational data, implying $Z\gtrsim \sqrt{3/2}\simeq 1.22$.

\subsubsection{Split-SUSY-like Case}
\label{splitsusycase}

Let us now analyze dark radiation predictions for Split-SUSY-like scenarios arising in the dS$_1$ (both local and ultra-local) and local dS$_2$ cases.
In these scenarios the hierarchy among soft-terms is (considering $\mu$ and $B\mu$-terms generated by $K$):
\begin{align}
\label{hierarchyss}
M_{1/2}^2 \simeq \hat{\mu}^2 \sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{{V}^4} \ll m_0^2 \simeq B\hat\mu \simeq m_{\Phi}^2 \sim \frac{M_{\rm P}^2}{{V}^3}\,.
\end{align}
The main difference with the MSSM-like case is that now $B\hat\mu$ and $m_0^2$ scale as $m_\Phi^2$. In order to understand if volume modulus decays into SUSY scalars are kinematically allowed, i.e. $R~\equiv m^2_0/m_\Phi^2 \leq 1/4$, we need therefore to compute the exact value of $m_\Phi$ and compare it with the results derived in Sec.~\ref{sssec:SoftTerms}. It turns out that $m_\Phi$ depends on the dS mechanism as follows:
\begin{align}
{\rm dS}_1: \,\, m_\Phi^2 = \frac{9}{8 a_s\tau_s} \frac{m_{3/2}^2\tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}} \qquad\qquad 
{\rm dS}_2: \,\, m_\Phi^2 = \frac{27}{4 a_s\tau_s} \frac{m_{3/2}^2\tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}\,.
\label{vmm}
\end{align}

Let us analyze each case separately:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Local and ultra-local dS$_1$ cases}: Even if the F-terms contribution to scalar masses in eq. ~\eqref{localscalar} for the local case can be made small by appropriately tuning the coefficient $c_s$, the D-terms contribution to $m_0^2$ given by~\eqref{genscalD} cannot be tuned to small values once the requirement of a dS vacuum is imposed. Hence for both local and ultra-local cases, $m_0^2$ cannot be made smaller than the value of eq.~\eqref{genscalD} giving:
\begin{align}
m_0^2\geq 2 m_\Phi^2 \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad R \geq 2\,,
\end{align}
which is clearly in contradiction with the condition $R\leq 1/4$ that has to be satisfied to open up the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars. Therefore 
the decay of $\Phi$ into squarks and sleptons is kinematically forbidden. 

\textit{Decay to Higgses}

Similarly to the MSSM-like case, $\Phi$ can still decay to higgs bosons via the GM term in (\ref{finallagr}). Given that $m_\Phi< m_0$, when $\Phi$ decays at energies of order $m_\Phi$, EWSB has already taken place at the scale $m_0$.\footnote{As we shall show later on, RG flow effects do not modify these considerations qualitatively.} The gauge eigenstates $h_i$ $i=1,...,8$ given in~\eqref{fields} then get rotated into $8$ mass eigenstates. $4$ higgs \textit{dof} which we denote by $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ remain heavy and acquire a mass of order $m_{H_d}^2 \simeq m_0^2$, and so the decay of $\Phi$ into these fields is kinematically forbidden. The remaining $4$ \textit{dof} are the $3$ would-be Goldstone bosons $G^0$ and $G^{\pm}$ which become the longitudinal components of $Z^0$ and $W^{\pm}$, and the ordinary SM higgs field $h^0$. The $\Phi$ decay rate into light higgs \textit{dof} can be obtained from the last term in~\eqref{finallagr} by writing the gauge eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates as~\cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{align}
h_1 = {\rm Re} G^+ \sin\beta + {\rm Re} H^+ \cos\beta\,,&\qquad& h_2 = - {\rm Re} G^+ \cos\beta + {\rm Re} H^+ \sin\beta\,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_3 = \sqrt{2} v_d + h^0 \sin\beta + H^0 \cos \beta \,, &\qquad& h_4 = \sqrt{2} v_u + h^0 \cos\beta - H^0 \sin\beta \,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_5 = - G^0 \cos\beta\, + A^0 \sin \beta\,,&\qquad& h_6 = G^0 \sin\beta\, + A^0 \cos \beta\,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_7 = {\rm Im} G^+ \sin\beta + {\rm Im} H^+ \cos \beta\,,&\qquad& h_8 = {\rm Im} G^+ \cos\beta - {\rm Im} H^+ \sin\beta\,,
\label{gauge-mass}
\end{align}
where $v_u \equiv \langle H^0_u \rangle$, $v_d \equiv \langle H^0_d \rangle$ and $\tan \beta~\equiv v_u/v_d$. Since in Split-SUSY-like models $\tan \beta \sim {O}(1)$ in order to reproduce the correct higgs mass~\cite{Giudice:2011cg, Bagnaschi:2014rsa}, the interaction lagrangian simplifies to:
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm cubic} \supset &\frac{Z}{2\sqrt{6}}\, \frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_{\rm P}} \, 
\hat\Phi \left[\left(h^0\right)^2+\left(G^0\right)^2+\left({\rm Re}G^+\right)^2+\left({\rm Im} G^+\right)^2 - \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&\left.- \left(A^0\right)^2 - \left(H^0\right)^2 - \left({\rm Re}H^+\right)^2 - \left({\rm Im}H^+\right)^2\right]\,.
\label{ewsbint}
\end{align}
Neglecting interaction terms involving heavy higgses, (\ref{ewsbint}) gives a decay rate of the form:
\begin{align}
\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh,GG}=d_1 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad d_1 \simeq 4\times\frac{Z^2}{4}\simeq Z^2\,.
\end{align}

\textit{Decay to Higgsinos}

$\Phi$ can also decay to higgsinos via the interaction lagrangian (\ref{higgsinocubic}). We need only to check if this decay is kinematically allowed. In Split-SUSY-like models EWSB takes place at the scale $m_0$ where the following relations hold:
\begin{align}
\hat\mu^2 = \frac{m_{H_d}^2 - m_{H_u}^2 \tan^2 \beta}{\tan^2 \beta - 1} - \frac{m_Z^2}{2}\,, \qquad \quad \sin\left(2 \beta\right) = \frac{2 |B \hat\mu|}{m_{H_d}^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + 2 \hat\mu^2}\,.
\label{ewsb}
\end{align}
In the case of universal boundary conditions for the higgs masses, i.e. $m_{H_u}=m_{H_d}=m_0$ at the GUT scale, the $\hat\mu$-term has necessarily to be of order the scalar masses $m_0$ since for $\tan \beta \sim \mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$ the first EWSB condition in (\ref{ewsb}) simplifies to:
\begin{align}
\hat\mu^2 \simeq \frac{m_{H_d}^2}{\tan^2 \beta - 1} \simeq m_0^2 \,,
\label{ewsb2}
\end{align}
given that $m_{H_u}^2$ runs down to values smaller than $m_{H_d}^2$ due to RG flow effects. On the other hand, $\hat\mu$ could be much smaller than $m_0$ for non-universal boundary conditions, i.e. if $m_{H_u} \neq m_{H_d}$ at the GUT scale. In fact, in Split-SUSY models $m_{H_u}^2$ is positive around the scale $m_0$, and so the first EWSB condition in (\ref{ewsb}) for $\hat\mu \ll m_0$ becomes:
\begin{align}
m_{H_d}^2 \simeq m_{H_u}^2 \tan^2 \beta \,.
\end{align}
This condition can be satisfied at the scale $m_0$ for a proper choice of boundary conditions at the GUT scale with $m_{H_u}>m_{H_d}$. Let us point out that, if $\hat\mu$ is determined by K\"ahler potential contributions (see Tab.~\ref{tab:PhenoScenarios}), $\hat\mu$ is suppressed with respect to $m_0$ but, if $\hat\mu$ is generated by non-perturbative effects in $W$, $\hat\mu$ can be of order $m_0$. In this case, the parametrization of the $\hat\mu$-term (\ref{stexp}) reproduces the correct $\tau_b$-dependence of the non-perturbatively induced $\hat\mu$-term if $\alpha = 3 n + 1$.\footnote{If the instanton number is $n = 1$, the $\hat\mu$-term can easily be of order $m_\Phi$ since $c_{\mu,W}$ is a flux-dependent tunable coefficient. For example, setting $\xi = a_s = 1$ and $g_s = 0.1$, the requirement $\hat{\mu} \simeq m_\Phi$ implies that $c_{\mu,W} \simeq W_0/(4\,{V}^{1/6})$. For $W_0 \simeq 10$ and ${V} \simeq 10^7$ we get $c_{\mu,W} \simeq 0.2$.} If we parametrize the ratio between $\hat\mu$ and $m_{\Phi}$ as $\tilde{c} \equiv \hat\mu/m_\Phi$, the decay of $\Phi$ into higgsinos is kinematically allowed only for $\tilde{c} \leq 1/2$. Using (\ref{higgsinosdr}), this decay rate takes the form (where we set $n = 1\,\Leftrightarrow\,\alpha = 4$):
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}} = d_2 \Gamma_0 \qquad\text{with}\qquad d_2 \simeq 8 \tilde{c}^2 \left(1 - 4 \tilde{c}^2\right)^{3/2}\,.
\label{higgsinogamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Dark radiation prediction}

Plugging $c_{\rm vis} = d_1 + d_2$ into~\eqref{dn} with $c_{\rm hid}=1$ we get the following general result:
\begin{align}
\frac{3.07}{Z^2 + d_2}\lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim  \frac{3.20}{Z^2 + d_2}\,.
\label{dS1pred}
\end{align}
Considering $\tilde{c} = 1/\sqrt{10}$ which maximizes $d_2 \simeq 0.37$ we find that for $0.2 \, {\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 10 \, {\rm GeV}$ this prediction yields values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ larger than unity for $Z = 1$. Consistency with present observational data, i.e. $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$, requires $Z\gtrsim 1.68$.

\item \emph{Local dS$_2$ case}: The situation seems more promising in this case since in the local limit the D-terms contribution to $m_0^2$ is volume-suppressed with respect to $m_\Phi^2$ since it scales as $\left. m_0^2\right|_D \sim {O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}. In this case it is therefore possible to tune the coefficient $c_s$ to obtain $R\leq 1/4$. By comparing the second term in~\eqref{vmm} with~\eqref{localscalar}, this implies that $c_s$ has to be tuned so that $\left(c_s - \frac 13\right) \leq \frac{9}{10 \, a_s \tau_s}$, where $a_s \tau_s \sim 80$ in order to get TeV-scale gaugino masses~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}. However the condition $m_0^2 > 0$ to avoid tachyonic masses translates into $\left(c_s - \frac 13\right)>0$, giving rise to a very small window: 
\begin{align}
0 < \left( c_s- \frac 13 \right) \leq \frac{9}{10 \, a_s \tau_s} \simeq 0.01\,.
\end{align}
Given that $c_s$ should be extremely fine-tuned, it seems very unlikely to open this decay channel. However the total K\"ahler potential, 
on top of pure $\alpha'$-corrections, can also receive perturbative string loop corrections of the form~\cite{Berg:2007wt}:
\begin{align}
K_{\rm loop} = \frac{g_s C_{\rm loop}}{{V}^{2/3}}\left(1+ k_{\rm loop}\sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_b}}\right)\,,
\label{Kloop}
\end{align}
where $C_{\rm loop}$ and $k_{\rm loop}$ are two ${O}(1)$ coefficients which depend on the complex structure moduli. Due to the \textit{extended no-scale structure}~\cite{Cicoli:2007xp}, $g_s$ effects do not modify the leading order scalar potential, and so the mass of the volume modulus is still given by~\eqref{vmm}. However, in order to reproduce a correct ultra-local limit~\eqref{ul}, we need to change the parametrization of the K\"ahler matter metric from~\eqref{newKtilde} to:
\begin{align}
\tilde{K} = \frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat{\xi}}{{V}} - c_{\rm loop} \frac{g_s C_{\rm loop}}{{V}^{2/3}} \right),
\label{KtildeNew}
\end{align}
where we introduced a new coefficient $c_{\rm loop}$ and we neglected $k_{\rm loop}$-dependent corrections in~\eqref{Kloop} since they are sub-dominant in the large volume limit $\tau_s\ll\tau_b$. The new ultra-local limit is now given by $c_s = c_{\rm loop} = 1/3$. 

These new $c_{\rm loop}$-dependent corrections in~\eqref{KtildeNew} affect the final result for scalar masses and can therefore open up the $\Phi$ decay channel to SUSY scalars. In fact, the result~\eqref{localscalar} for scalar masses in the local case gets modified to: 
\begin{align}
\left.m_0^2\right|_F = \frac{15}{2}\, \frac{m_{3/2}^2 \tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}
\left[\left(c_s-\frac{1}{3}\right) - \frac{8 g_s C_{\rm loop}}{15} \left(c_{\rm loop} - \frac 13\right)
\frac{{V}^{1/3}}{\hat\xi}\right] \,.
\label{newlsm}
\end{align}
The two terms in square brackets are of the same order for $g_s\simeq 0.1$ and ${V} \sim 10^7$ which is needed to get TeV-scale gauginos, and so they can compete to get $R \leq \frac 14$. As an illustrative example, if we choose $c_s = 1/3$ and natural values of the other parameters: $C_{\rm loop} = a_s = 1$, $\xi = 2$ and $c_{\rm loop} = 0$ (non-tachyonic scalars require $c_{\rm loop} < 1/3$ for $c_s = 1/3$), the ratio between squared masses becomes:
\begin{align}
R = \frac{8}{81}\, g_s^{3/2}\,{V}^{1/3}\,.
\end{align}
As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{psf}, there is now a wide region of the parameter space where the $\Phi$ decay to SUSY scalars is allowed.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, angle=0]{Images/Fig1.pdf}
\caption{The green region in the ($g_s$, ${V}$) parameter space gives $R \leq 1/4$, and so the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars is kinematically allowed.} 
\label{psf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We finally point out that $g_s$ corrections to the K\"ahler matter metric affect the result for scalar masses only in the local case since in the ultra-local limit $m_0$ is generated by effects (D-terms for dS$_1$ and F-terms of $S$ and $U$-moduli for dS$_2$) which are sensitive only to the leading order expression of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
Let us now analyze the final prediction for dark radiation production for Split-SUSY-like models where the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars is kinematically allowed.

\subsubsection*{Dark Radiation Results}
\label{drresults}

We start by parametrizing the scalar mass $m_0$ in terms of the volume mode mass $m_\Phi$ as $m_0 = c \,m_\Phi$ and the $\hat\mu$-term as $\mu = \tilde{c}\,m_\Phi$ so that the corresponding kinematic constraints for $\Phi$ decays into SUSY scalars and higgsinos become $c \leq \frac 12$ and $\tilde{c}\leq \frac 12$.
Parametrizing also the $B\hat\mu$-term as in (\ref{eq:SummarySoftLocal}) and using the fact that for Split-SUSY-like models we have in (\ref{stexp}) $\beta = \gamma = 9/2$ and $\alpha = 4$,\footnote{We focus on the case where the $\hat\mu$-term is generated by non-perturbative effects in $W$ since when $\hat\mu$ is generated by $K$, it turns out to be very suppressed with respect to $m_0$, i.e. $\tilde{c}\ll 1$, and so it gives rise to a negligible contribution to the branching ratio of $\Phi$.} the leading order cubic lagrangian is given by the sum of (\ref{finallagr}) and (\ref{higgsinocubic}):
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm cubic} \simeq &\frac{7 c^2}{2\sqrt{6}}\frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_{\rm P}} \hat\Phi\left[  
\sigma^\alpha\sigma_\alpha + \chi^\alpha\chi_\alpha+\left(1+\frac{6\tilde{c}^2}{7 c^2}\right)h_i h^i+ \right.\nonumber\\ \\
&\left.+ 2Z  \left(c_{B,K}  - \frac{1}{7 c^2} \right) \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right] +\nonumber\\ \\	
&+ \tilde{c}\sqrt{\frac 23} \, \frac{m_\Phi}{M_{\rm P}}\hat\Phi \left(\tilde{H}_u^+\tilde{H}_d^- -\tilde{H}_u^0\tilde{H}_d^0\right)+\text{h.c.}.
\label{intlagr}
\end{align}
Contrary to the MSSM-like case, now the decay of the volume modulus into squarks and sleptons through mass terms is kinematically allowed and also the decay rate into higgses is enhanced due to mass terms and $B\hat\mu$ couplings. Using~\eqref{dw1}, the total decay rate into squarks and sleptons reads:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} = c_0 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_0 = N\times \frac{49 \, c^4}{4} \sqrt{1 - 4 c^2}\,, 
\end{align}
where $N=90$ is the number of real scalar \textit{dof} of the MSSM,\footnote{$12$ \textit{dof} for each left handed squark doublet ($3$ families), $6$ \textit{dof} for each right handed squark ($6$ squarks), $4$ \textit{dof} for each left handed slepton doublet ($3$ families), $2$ \textit{dof} for each right handed slepton ($3$ families).} except for the higgses.

On the other hand, the decay rate into higgs bosons receives contributions from both mass and GM terms. Using~\eqref{dw1} we obtain:
\begin{align}
\Gamma^{\rm (mass)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_1 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_1 = 8 \times \frac{49 \, c^4}{4} \left(1+\frac{2\tilde{c}^2}{7 c^2}\right)^2\sqrt{1 - 4 (c^2+\tilde{c}^2)}\,, 
\end{align}
where $8$ is the number of MSSM real higgs \textit{dof} while using (\ref{dw2}) we get:
\begin{align}
\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_2 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_2 = 4\times\frac{Z^2}{2} \left(7 c_{B,K} c^2  - 1 \right)^2 \sqrt{1 - 4\,c^2}\,.
\end{align}
The decay rate into higgsinos is given again by~\eqref{higgsinogamma} and thus the total $\Phi$ decay rate into visible sector fields becomes:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\rm vis} = \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi}+\Gamma^{\rm (mass)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh}+\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh}+\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}\tilde{H}}= c_{\rm vis} \Gamma_0 \,,
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{where}\qquad c_{\rm vis} = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + d_2 \,.
\end{align}
The final prediction for dark radiation production is then given by~\eqref{dn} with $c_{\rm hid}=1$, $g_*(T_{\rm dec}) = 10.75$ and $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 86.25$ for $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 0.7\,{\rm GeV}$.\footnote{The results do not change significantly for $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 75.75$ which is valid for $0.2\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 0.7\, {\rm GeV}$.} The results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{ris1} where we have set $c_{B,K}=1$, $Z = 1$ and we are considering a conservative case in which the decay into higgsinos is negligible, i.e. $\tilde{c} = 0$. For $c>0.2$, the vast majority of the parameter space yields $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1$, in perfect agreement with present experimental bounds with a minimum value $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min} \simeq 0.14$ at $c \simeq 1/\sqrt{5}$.\\

It is interesting to notice that, contrary to the MSSM-like case, dark radiation over-production can now be avoided if the GM term is absent or it is very suppressed. In fact even for $Z=0$, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1$ if $c\gtrsim 0.23$, as a consequence of the fact that in this region of the parameter space almost the whole suppression of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is due to the decay into scalar fields. The predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ for different values of the GM coupling $Z = 0$ (blue line), $Z = 1$ (red line) and $Z = 2$ (green line) are shown in Fig.~\ref{z123}.\\

For $\tilde{c} \neq 0$ $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is even further suppressed than what is shown in Fig.~\ref{ris1} and~\ref{z123} but the correction is at the percent level in the interesting region where the decay into scalars dominates $\Gamma_{\rm vis}$. For example including the effect of decays into higgsinos and setting $\tilde{c} \simeq 1/\sqrt{10}$ to maximize the decay rate into higgsinos, the correction $\left.\delta \Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}$ to $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}$ turns out to be:
\begin{align}
\frac{\left.\delta \Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}}{\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}} \simeq 0.03 \,.
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.42\textwidth, angle=0]{Images/Fig2.pdf}
\caption{Dark radiation production in Split-SUSY-like models for $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 0.7 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $\tilde{c}=0$.} 
\label{ris1}
\end{center}

Note that $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can be further suppressed by choosing $c_{B,K} > 1$, namely by enhancing the contribution due to the $B\hat\mu$-term. However 
the decay scale $m_\Phi$ is just slightly larger than the EWSB scale $m_0$ where the $4$ \textit{dof} of the two higgs doublets get rotated into the heavy higgs mass eigenstates $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$, the SM higgs $h^0$ and the longitudinal components $G^0, G^\pm$ of the vector bosons $Z, W^\pm$. Hence the $B\hat\mu$-term gets reabsorbed into the mass terms for $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ and $h^0, G^0, G^\pm$, and so varying $c_{B,K}$ does not enhance $\Gamma_{\rm vis}$ which receives its main contributions from the decay into squarks, sleptons and heavy higgses through the mass term (assuming that is kinematically allowed) and into all higgs \textit{dof} via the GM term. These considerations will become more clear in the next section where we will take into account corrections due to RG flow effects. A possible way-out could be the separation between the EWSB scale and the volume modulus mass, which translates into requiring $c \ll 1$. However this choice would imply $m_0^2 \ll m_\Phi^2 \sim B\hat\mu$ which would be a quite unnatural situation from a top-down perspective since $m_\Phi$ and $m_0$ have the same volume scaling.

\subsubsection*{RG Flow Effects}
\label{rgflows}

The results obtained above have to be corrected due to RG flow effects from the string scale to the actual scale $m_\Phi$ where the modulus decay takes place~\cite{Angus:2013zfa}. However these corrections do not alter qualitatively our results since $\Phi$ interacts only gravitationally and the running of squarks and sleptons in Split-SUSY models is almost absent~\cite{Bagnaschi:2014rsa}. For sake of completeness, let us study these RG flow effects in detail.\\

The soft-terms $m_0$, $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ entering in the interaction lagrangian~\eqref{finallagr} are just boundary conditions for the RG flow and should instead be evaluated at the scale $m_\Phi$ where the light modulus $\Phi$ decays. The RG equations for the first and second generation of squarks and sleptons are given by:
\begin{align}
m^2_\alpha = m_0^2 + \sum_{a=1}^3 c_{\alpha,a} K_a\,,
\end{align}
where $c_{\alpha,a}$ is the weak hypercharge squared for each SUSY scalar and the RG running contributions $K_a$ are proportional 
to gaugino masses~\cite{Martin:1997ns}. Given that in Split-SUSY-like models gaugino masses are hierarchically lighter than scalar masses, 
the RG running of first and second generation squarks and sleptons is a negligible effect. Thus we can consider their mass at the scale $m_\Phi$ as still given by $m_0$ to a high level of accuracy.\\

The situation for the third generation is slightly trickier since there are additional contributions from large Yukawa couplings. Using mSUGRA boundary conditions, the relevant RG equations become (ignoring contributions proportional to $M_{1/2}$)~\cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{align}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{Q_3}^2 = X_t + X_b\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{u}_3}^2 = 2 X_t\,,
\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{d}_3}^2 = 2 X_b\,,
\label{RG1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{L_3}^2 = X_\tau\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{e}_3}^2 = 2 X_\tau\,,
\label{RG2}
\end{align}
which are coupled to those involving higgs masses:
\begin{align}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_u}^2 = 3 X_t + X_b\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_d}^2 = 3 X_b + X_\tau\,.
\label{RG3}
\end{align}
The quantities $X_i$ look like:
\begin{align}
\label{xi1}
X_t = 2 |y_t|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{Q_3}^2 + m_{\overline{u}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_t|^2\,, \\
\label{xi2}
X_b = 2 |y_b|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{Q_3}^2 + m_{\overline{d}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_b|^2\,, \\
\label{xi3}
X_\tau = 2 |y_\tau|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{L_3}^2 + m_{\overline{e}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_\tau|^2\,,
\end{align}
where $y_i$ are the Yukawa couplings and $a_i$ are the only sizable entries of the $A$-term couplings. Given that for sequestered scenarios the $A$-terms scale as $M_{1/2}$~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}, the contribution $2 |a_i|^2$ can be neglected with respect to the first term in each $X_i$. Moreover $X_t$, $X_b$ and $X_\tau$ are all positive, and so the RG equations~\eqref{RG1} and~\eqref{RG2} drive the scalar masses to smaller values at lower energies. This has a two-fold implication:
\begin{itemize}
\item When $m_0 > m_\Phi$, RG running effects could lower $m_0$ to values smaller than $m_\Phi/2$ so that the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up at the scale $m_\Phi$. However this never happens since RG effects are negligible.

\item When $m_0 \leq m_\Phi/2$, no one of the scalars becomes heavier than the volume modulus if $R < \frac 14$ at the boundary energy scale. On the other hand, RG running effects could still lower the scalar masses too much, suppressing the $\Phi$ decay rate to SUSY scalars. However this does not happen since RG effects are negligible.
\end{itemize}
In Split-SUSY-like models a correct radiative realization of EWSB requires a low value of $\tan \beta$~\cite{Bagnaschi:2014rsa}, which implies $y_b,\,y_\tau\ll y_t$. In turn, $X_b$ and $X_\tau$ give rise to a tiny effect, and so the running of $m_{H_d}^2$, $m_{\overline{d}_3}^2$, $m_{L_3}^2$ and $m_{\overline{e}_3}^2$ turns out to be negligible. In the end, the only relevant RG equations become:
\begin{align}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{Q_3}^2 \simeq X_t\,, \qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{u}_3}^2 \simeq 2 X_t\,, \qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_u}^2 = 3 X_t\,.
\end{align}

We performed a numerical computation of the RG running, using as boundary conditions $m_0 = B\hat\mu^{1/2} = \hat\mu = 10^7 \, \rm GeV$ and $M_a = 10^3 \, \rm GeV$ at the GUT scale $M_{\rm GUT} = 2 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $\tan \beta \simeq 1.4$. We also used that the stop left-right mixing is given by $\chi_t = A_t - \hat\mu \cot \beta \simeq - m_0/{\tan \beta}$, being $A_t \simeq M_{1/2} \ll m_0$. We used SusyHD~\cite{Vega:2015fna} to run the Yukawa couplings from the top mass scale up to $m_0$ combined with SARAH~\cite{Staub:2008uz} to run them from $m_0$ up to the GUT scale.\footnote{We are grateful to J. P. Vega for useful discussions about this point.} These runnings have been computed at order one loop. Using the values of the Yukawa couplings obtained at the GUT scale, we have been able to compute the running of scalars, $\hat\mu$, $B\hat\mu$ and the GM coupling $Z$ down to the scale of the decay $m_\Phi$. Fig.~\ref{scr} shows the running of scalar masses while Fig.~\ref{hr} shows the running of $m_{H_u}^2$ and $m_{H_d}^2$. The running of $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ is almost negligible. We clarify that our purpose here is not to study EWSB in full detail but to understand which kind of behavior we should expect for the running of soft-terms from the GUT scale to $m_\Phi$ using boundary conditions which are consistent with EWSB.

\caption{Running of the higgs masses.}\label{hr}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Due to RG running effects each of the scalars has a different mass at the scale $m_\Phi$, and so the exact prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ becomes:
\begin{align}
\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{43}{7} \mathcal{R} \left(\frac{g_* (T_{\rm decay})}{g_*(T_{\rm reheat})}\right)^{1/3} \,,
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
{R} = \frac{\Gamma_0}{\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} + \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} + \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}}}\,.
\end{align}
The decay rate into squarks and sleptons is given by:
\begin{align}
\label{gs}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} = \frac{49}{4} \sum_\alpha \, \kappa_\alpha \left(\frac{m_\alpha}{m_\Phi}\right)^4 \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_\alpha}{m_\Phi}\right)^2}\Gamma_0\,,
\end{align}
where the index $\alpha$ runs over all squarks and sleptons $m_\alpha = \left( m_{\tilde{Q}_{\rm L}}, m_{\tilde{u}_R}, m_{\tilde{d}_R}, m_{\tilde{L}}, m_{\tilde{e}_{\rm R}}\right)$ while $\kappa_\alpha$ is the number of \textit{dof} for each scalar.\footnote{It turns out that $\kappa_\alpha = \left(36, 18, 18, 12, 6\right)$.}\\

On the other hand the decay rate into higgs \textit{dof} is given by (we focus on the case where $\hat\mu\ll m_0$ since, as we have seen in the previous section, a large $\hat\mu$-term gives rise just to a negligible correction to the final dark radiation prediction):
\begin{align}
\label{gh}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = \left[\sum_{I \in \{A^0, H^0, H^\pm\}} \left(\frac{49}{4} \left(\frac{m_{I}}{m_{\Phi}} \right)^4 + Z^2 \right) \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_{I}}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^2} + Z^2\right]\Gamma_0\, .
\end{align}
All quantities in (\ref{gs}) and (\ref{gh}) have to be computed at the decay scale $m_\Phi$. As already explained in the previous section, $B\hat\mu$ does not explicitly contribute to (\ref{gh}) since it gets reabsorbed into the higgs masses due to EWSB. The decay of $\Phi$ into heavy higgses $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ through the mass term can instead contribute to $\Gamma_{\rm Higgs}$, provided that $m_{A^0, H^0, H^\pm}/m_\Phi \leq 1/2$. The mass of the heavy higgses in the limit $m_Z, m_{W^\pm} \ll m_{A^0}$ can be written as~\cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{align}
m_{H^0}^2 \simeq m_{H^\pm}^2 \simeq m_{A^0}^2 \simeq 2 |\hat\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + m_{H_d}^2 \,.
\end{align}
The decay rate into higgsinos instead reads:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}} = 8 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2 \left(1 - 4 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2\right)^{3/2} \Gamma_0 \,,
\label{higgsinodecayrg}
\end{align}
where we added the two contributions in~\eqref{higgsinosdr} and we used $\alpha = 4$. In~\eqref{higgsinodecayrg} $\hat\mu/m_\Phi \neq \tilde{c}$, since $\hat\mu$ is computed at the decay scale $m_\Phi$.\\

We computed $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ for different values of $m_\Phi$, keeping the boundary conditions fixed at $m_0 = B\hat\mu^{1/2} = \hat\mu = 10^7 \, \rm GeV$ and $M_a = 10^3$ GeV. The qualitative behavior of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is the same as in the previous section where RG flow effects have been ignored. The results are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab1} which shows that the dominant contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is given by the decay into squarks and sleptons while the suppression coming from decay into higgsinos is always sub-dominant. If $m_\Phi \simeq 2.2 \times 10^7 \, \rm GeV$, corresponding to $m_0/m_\Phi \simeq 1/\sqrt{5}$, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.15$ which is only slightly larger then $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min} = 0.14$ computed in the previous section without taking into account RG flow effects. This is due to the fact that the running of the SUSY scalars is negligible as can be clearly seen from Fig.~\ref{scr}.

The decay into higgsinos is always a sub-leading effect.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

Extra dark radiation is a very promising window for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Its presence is a generic feature of string models where some of the moduli are stabilized by perturbative effects since the corresponding axionic partners remain very light and can behave as extra neutrino-like species~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. These light hidden sector \textit{dof} are produced by the decay of the lightest modulus~\cite{Acharya:2008bk, Acharya:2009zt, Acharya:2010af, Allahverdi:2013noa} leading to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\neq 0$~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Higaki:2013lra}.\\

In this chapter we performed a general analysis of axionic dark radiation production in sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is localized on D3-branes at singularities~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa, Conlon:2008wa, Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha}. These models yield a very interesting post-inflationary cosmological history where reheating is driven by the decay of the lightest modulus $\Phi$ with a mass of order $m_\Phi\sim 10^7$ GeV which leads to a reheating temperature of order $T_{\rm rh}\sim 1$ GeV. The gravitino mass is much larger than $m_\Phi$ ($m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV), so avoiding any gravitino problem~\cite{Endo:2006zj, Nakamura:2006uc}. Low-energy SUSY can still be achieved due to sequestering effects that keep the supersymmetric partners light. Gauginos are around the TeV-scale whereas squarks and sleptons can either be as light as the gauginos or as heavy as the lightest modulus $\Phi$ depending on the moduli dependence of the matter K\"ahler metric and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}.\\

The final prediction for dark radiation production due to the decay of the volume modulus into ultra-light bulk closed string axions depends on the details of the visible sector construction:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{MSSM-like case}: \\
MSSM-like models arise from the ultra-local dS$_2$ case where the leading visible sector decay channel of $\Phi$ is to higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. The simplest model with two higgs doublets and $Z=1$ gives $1.53 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1.60$ for $500\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 5\,{\rm GeV}$~\cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar}. Values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ smaller than unity require $Z\gtrsim 1.22$ or more than two higgs doublets.

\item \textit{Split-SUSY-like case with $m_0> m_\Phi/2$}: \\
Local and ultra-local dS$_1$ cases give rise to Split-SUSY-like scenarios where scalar masses $m_0$ receive a contribution from D-terms which cannot be made smaller than $m_\Phi/2$. Thus the decay of $\Phi$ into squarks and sleptons is kinematically forbidden. The leading visible sector decay channel of $\Phi$ is again to higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. However, given that EWSB takes place at the scale $m_0$ which in these cases is larger than the decay scale $m_\Phi$, the volume mode $\Phi$ can decay only to the 4 light higgs \textit{dof}. For a shift-symmetric higgs sector with $Z=1$, the final prediction for dark radiation production is $3.07 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 3.20$. Consistency with present experimental data, i.e. $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$, requires $Z\gtrsim 1.68$. In most of the parameter space of Split-SUSY-like models a correct radiative EWSB can be achieved only if the $\hat\mu$-term is of order the scalar masses. Hence, depending on the exact value of $\hat\mu$, the decay of $\Phi$ into higgsinos could not be mass suppressed. However it gives rise just to a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.

\item \textit{Split-SUSY-like case with $m_0\leq m_\Phi/2$}: \\
Given that in the local dS$_2$ case the D-terms contribution to scalar masses is negligible, the decay of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars can become kinematically allowed. In fact, thanks to the inclusion of string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential~\cite{Cicoli:2007xp, Berg:2007wt}, a large region of the underlying parameter space features $m_0\leq m_\Phi/2$. Hence the final prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ gets considerably reduced with respect to the previous two cases since, in addition to decays into higgses via the GM term, leading order contributions to the branching ratio to visible sector particles involve decays into squarks and sleptons, decays into heavy higgses induced by mass terms and possible decays into higgsinos depending on the exact value of the $\hat\mu$-term. Depending on the exact value of $m_0$, the simplest model with $Z=1$ gives $0.14 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1.6$. Hence these models feature values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in perfect agreement with present observational bounds. Note that dark radiation overproduction can be avoided even for $Z=0$ due to the new decay channels to squarks and sleptons.
\end{enumerate}

We finally studied corrections to these results due to RG flow effects from the string scale $M_s \sim 10^{15}$ GeV to the volume mode mass $m_\Phi\sim 10^7$ GeV where the actual decay takes place. However these corrections do not modify our predictions since the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible effect in Split-SUSY-like models and radiative corrections to $m_\Phi$ are tiny since moduli are only gravitational coupled.

\section{Introduction}

Two crucial quantities of any string compactification are the Hubble scale during inflation $H$ and the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. The first sets the inflationary energy scale $M_{\rm inf}\sim \sqrt{H M_{\rm P}}$ which in turn is related to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ as $M_{\rm inf}\sim M_{\rm GUT}\left(\frac{r}{0.1}\right)^{1/4}$, whereas the second gives the order of magnitude of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}$. Given that neither primordial tensor modes nor supersymmetric particles have been detected yet, experimental data yield just upper and lower bounds on these two quantities: 
\begin{align}
r\lesssim 0.1 \quad\,&&\Rightarrow \quad &&H \lesssim \frac{M_{\rm GUT}^2}{M_{\rm P}} \sim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV} \label{rbound} \\
M_{\rm soft}\gtrsim 1\,{\rm TeV}\quad&&\Rightarrow\quad &&m_{3/2}\gtrsim 1\,{\rm TeV}\,. \label{Msoftbound}
\end{align}
However $H$ and $m_{3/2}$ are not two independent quantities since in any consistent string inflationary model the inflaton dynamics has not to destabilize the volume mode. This is guaranteed if the inflationary energy is smaller than the energy barrier to decompactification, i.e. $H^2 M_{\rm P}^2 \lesssim V_{\rm barrier}$, and the height of the barrier is generically set by the gravitino mass. In KKLT models $V_{\rm barrier}\sim m_{3/2}^2 M_{\rm P}^2$ which leads to $H\lesssim m_{3/2}$~\cite{Kallosh:2004yh} while in the LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) $V_{\rm barrier}\sim m_{3/2}^3 M_{\rm P}$ giving $H\lesssim m_{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}}$~\cite{Conlon:2008cj}.\\

These theoretical bounds are not in contradiction with the experimental bounds (\ref{rbound}) and (\ref{Msoftbound}), in particular for the cases of high-scale supersymmetry and small field inflationary models with unobservable tensor modes. However the phenomenologically interesting cases of low-energy supersymmetry with $M_{\rm soft}\gtrsim {O}(1)$ TeV and large field inflationary models with $r\gtrsim {O}(0.01)$ would imply a high value of $H$ together with a small value of $m_{3/2}$, in clear tension with the theoretical bounds from volume destabilization problems.\\

Several ideas have been proposed in the literature to overcome this tension between TeV-scale supersymmetry and large field inflation. Here we briefly summarize them:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The relation $H^2 M_{\rm P}^2\lesssim V_{\rm barrier}$ would be independent of $m_{3/2}$ in models where the energy barrier and the gravitino mass are two uncorrelated quantities.  Racetrack superpotentials~\cite{Kallosh:2004yh}, models of natural inflation as in~\cite{Kappl:2015pxa} or models of D-terms inflation from field-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos~\cite{Wieck:2014xxa} can provide viable models where $V_{\rm barrier}$ is decoupled from $m_{3/2}$.

\item The KKLT bound $H\lesssim m_{3/2}$ and the LVS bound $H\lesssim m_{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}}$ apply just to the inflationary era, and so in these expression $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass during inflation which might be different from the present value of the gravitino mass. This is possible if $m_{3/2}= e^{K/2} |W| \simeq \frac{W_0}{{V}} M_{\rm P}$ evolves just after the end of inflation. Two viable realizations include inflationary models where the inflaton coincides with the volume mode ${V}$ so that ${V}$ relaxes from small to large values during inflation~\cite{Conlon:2008cj} or where the inflaton is a complex structure modulus or a matter field so that $W$ relaxes from large to small values during inflation~\cite{He:2010uk}. Another option is to consider models with two different volume stabilization mechanisms during and after inflation. If ${V}$ couples to the field $X$ whose F-term drives inflation, the volume's vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation would be determined by the F-terms potential of $X$ which however vanishes after the end of inflation when ${V}$ is fixed by a more standard KKLT or LVS mechanism. This kind of models with a K\"ahler potential coupling between ${V}$ and $X$ have been studied in~\cite{Antusch:2011wu} whereas superpotential interactions between ${V}$ and $X$ have been analyzed in~\cite{Yamada:2012tj}.

\item Another possible way-out to reconcile low-energy supersymmetry with high scale inflation is to consider models where the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of supersymmetry breaking so that the soft-terms are much smaller than the gravitino mass~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. This can be the case for compactifications where the visible sector is localized on fractional D3-branes at singularities which can lead to $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}$.
\end{enumerate} 

Let us point out that all the solutions listed above require a high degree of tuning except for the sequestered case which might be however not enough to completely remove all the tension between observable tensor modes and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Moreover, it is technically rather complicated to provide consistent string models where these solutions are explicitly realized. Therefore they are at the moment at the level of string-inspired toy-models without a concrete string embedding where one can check if there is enough tuning freedom to achieve the amount of fine tuning needed to reproduce all the desired phenomenological details.\\

In this chapter we shall provide a first step towards an explicit stringy embedding of the case where the volume mode plays the r\^ole of the inflaton evolving from small to large values after the end of inflation~\cite{Conlon:2008cj}. We will describe a possible microscopic origin of the potential terms used in~\cite{Conlon:2008cj} to create an inflection point at small volumes around which slow-roll inflation can occur. Moreover, we shall also perform a deeper analysis of the relation between the position of the inflection point and the minimum with the tuning of the flux superpotential.\\

Before presenting the details of our analysis, let us stress some key-features of the model under study:
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to have an evolving gravitino mass, we focus on models where the inflaton is the volume mode ${V}$. Given that we work in an effective supergravity theory where the K\"ahler potential has a logarithmic dependence on ${V}$, each term in the inflationary potential will be a negative exponential of the canonically normalized volume mode $\Phi\sim \ln{V}$, i.e. $V \supset e^{- k \Phi}$. This form of the potential is reminiscent of Starobinsky-like models which have a rather large inflationary scale since they are at the boarder between large and small field models~\cite{Starobinsky:1980te}. However Starobinsky-like potentials feature also an inflaton-independent constant which can never appear in cases where the inflaton is the volume mode ${V}$ since ${V}$ couples to all sources of energy because of the Weyl rescaling needed to obtain the correct effective action.\footnote{Starobinsky-like models with large $r$ and a constant inflaton-independent constant can instead be obtained in models where the inflaton is a K\"ahler modulus different from the volume mode~\cite{Cicoli:2008gp}.}

\item The best way to achieve volume inflation is therefore to consider a potential which has enough tuning freedom to create an inflection point and then realize inflation in the vicinity of the inflection point. The price to pay is that this inflationary scenario turns out to be rather fine tuned and it is necessarily a small field model with a sub-Planckian field range during inflation $\Delta\Phi\sim 0.4 \,M_{\rm P}$, unobservable tensor modes of order $r\sim 10^{-9}$ and low Hubble scale $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. Hence this approach cannot solve completely the tension between large tensor modes and TeV-scale supersymmetry. Still it provides a big step forward especially if combined with a sequestered visible sector so that low-energy supersymmetry can be safely reconciled with a high gravitino mass.

\item In LVS models where $H> m_{3/2} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}}$ and the inflaton is the volume mode, the destabilization problem of~\cite{Kallosh:2004yh} becomes an overshooting problem since the inflaton has an initial energy which is larger than the barrier to decompactification. The solution to this problem via radiation production after the end of inflation has already been discussed in~\cite{Conlon:2008cj}, and so we shall not dwell on this issue. 

\item In the models under study, the Hubble scale during inflation is set by the gravitino mass during inflation $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}$ which is much larger than the gravitino mass today $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}$ due to the volume evolution. Hence the Hubble scale $H$ can be much larger than $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}$ since we have:
\begin{align}
H \sim m_{3/2}^{\rm inf} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}}{W_0\,M_{\rm P}}} \gg m_{3/2}^{\rm today} \sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}^{\rm today}}{W_0\,M_{\rm P}}}\,.
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
We shall analyze both the single modulus and the two moduli case focusing on three different visible sector realizations which lead to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{High-scale SUSY models}: in this case the requirement of low-energy supersymmetry is relaxed and the value of the gravitino mass both during and after inflation is huge. The volume mode evolves from values of order $100$ during inflation to values of order $200$ after the end of inflation. The flux superpotential has to be tuned to values of order $W_0\sim 10^{-5}$ in order to reproduce the correct amplitude of the density perturbations. Thus the order of magnitude of the gravitino mass during and after inflation is the same, $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10^{11}$ GeV corresponding to $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. Due to the small value of ${V}$, in this case the validity of the effective field theory approach is not fully under control.

\item \textit{Non-sequestered models}: in these models during inflation the volume is of order ${V} \sim 10^5$ and $W_0\sim 1$ giving a gravitino mass of order $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim 10^{14}$ GeV which leads again to $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. After the end of inflation the volume evolves to ${V}\sim 10^{15}$ as required to get TeV-scale supersymmetry since the present value of the gravitino mass becomes $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10$ TeV~\cite{Conlon:2005ki}.

\item \textit{Sequestered models}: in these models inflection point volume inflation takes place again for values of order ${V} \sim 10^5$ and $W_0\sim 1$ which yield $m_{3/2}^{\rm inf}\sim 10^{14}$ GeV and $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. After the end of inflation the volume evolves instead to ${V}\sim 10^7$ corresponding to $m_{3/2}^{\rm today}\sim 10^{11}$ GeV, as required to get low-energy supersymmetry gaugino masses in sequestered scenarios where $M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \frac{m_{3/2}}{M_{\rm P}}\sim 10$ TeV~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. 
\end{enumerate}

This chapter is organized as follows. Sec.~\ref{SecIPInf} is a brief review of the basic concepts of inflection point inflation which will be used in the rest of the chapter while in Sec.~\ref{SecOrigin} we describe a possible microscopic origin of all the terms in the inflationary potential which are needed to develop an inflection point at small values of ${V}$ together with a dS minimum at larger values of the volume mode. In Sec.~\ref{SecSingle} we study the single modulus case presenting first an analytical qualitative description of the inflationary dynamics and then performing an exact numerical analysis. The two moduli case typical of LVS models is instead discussed in Sec.~\ref{SecTwo} before presenting our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{SecConcl}. This chapter is based on~\cite{Cicoli:2015wja}.


\section{Inflection Point Inflation}
\label{SecIPInf}

In this section we briefly review the generic features of inflection point inflation, closely following ~\cite{Baumann:2007ah} and~\cite{Linde:2007jn}. We summarize the main points and discuss the tuning involved in these models.\\

The basic assumption is that inflation takes place around an inflection point along some arbitrary direction in field space. The scalar potential around such an inflection point can always be expanded as:
\begin{align}
V = V_{\rm ip} \left(1+ \lambda_1 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})+ \frac{\lambda_3}{3!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^3+\frac{\lambda_4}{4!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^4+\dots\right),
\end{align}
where $\phi_{\rm ip}$ denotes the position of the inflection point. Given that we shall focus on cases where the field excursion during the inflationary period is small, i.e. $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$, the quartic term can be safely neglected. We therefore find that it suffices to analyze the following potential:
\begin{align}
V = V_{\rm ip} \left(1+ \lambda_1 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip}) + \frac{\lambda_3}{3!} (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^3\right).
\label{appr}
\end{align}
The inflationary observables are determined by the slow-roll parameters:
\begin{align}
\epsilon &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{V'}{V}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\lambda_1 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda_3 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})^2\right)^2\simeq \frac{1}{2}\lambda_1^2\,,
\label{eps} \\
\eta &= \frac{V''}{V} = \lambda_3 (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\,,
\label{eq:srParams}
\end{align}
which have to be evaluated at horizon exit where $\phi=\phi_*$. Note that in (\ref{eps}) and (\ref{eq:srParams}) we approximated $V \simeq V_{\rm ip}$ in the denominator, which is a good approximation for small field models where $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$. Notice that if $\lambda_3\gtrsim 1$ this small field condition has to be satisfied in order to obtain $\eta\ll 1$. If instead $\lambda_3$ is tuned such that $\lambda_3\ll 1$, the condition $\eta\ll 1$ could be satisfied also for large field values but then the approximation (\ref{appr}) would be under control only by tuning all the coefficients of the expansion. We shall therefore focus only on the case $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\ll 1$. The number of e-foldings is given by:
\begin{align} 
N_e(\phi_*) = \int_{\phi_{\rm end}}^{\phi} \frac{d \phi}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_3}} 
\arctan \left.\left[\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_3}{2\lambda_1}}(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\right]\right|_{\phi_{\rm end}}^{\phi_*}\,.
\label{Ne}
\end{align}
In order to have enough e-foldings we need $\lambda_1\ll 1$, which is also needed to get $\epsilon\ll 1$, and $(\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\gtrsim \sqrt{\lambda_1}$ so that the arc-tangent does not give a small number. Thus the slow-roll parameter $\eta$ turns out to be larger than $\epsilon$ since:
\begin{align}
\epsilon\sim \lambda_1^2 \ll \eta \sim (\phi - \phi_{\rm ip})\gtrsim \sqrt{\lambda_1}\ll 1\,.
\end{align}
Therefore the spectral index in these models is essentially given by $\eta$:
\begin{align}
n_s - 1 = 2 \eta(\phi_*) - 6 \epsilon(\phi_*) \simeq 2 \eta(\phi_*)\,,
\end{align}
By using (\ref{Ne}), it is possible to rewrite the spectral index as a function of the number of e-foldings as: 
\begin{align}
n_s - 1 \simeq - \frac{4}{N_e} + \frac 23 \lambda_1\lambda_3 N_e\,.
\label{eq:ns}
\end{align}
Since $1 - \frac{4}{N_e} \simeq 0.93$ for $N_e\simeq 60$, it is evident that for a very small $\lambda_1$ (or equivalently a very flat inflection point) the spectral index asymptotes to $0.93$. We have therefore to use (\ref{eq:ns}) to determine the value of $\lambda_1$ that gives a value of $n_s$ in agreement with recent Planck data, i.e. $n_s = 0.9655\pm 0.0062$ ($68\%$ CL)~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}. We find:
\begin{align}
n_s=0.965 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \lambda_1=7.92\cdot 10^{-4}\,\lambda_3^{-1}\qquad\text{for}\qquad N_e=60\,.
\label{correctns}
\end{align}
In these small field models, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ turns out to be unobservable since:
\begin{align}
r= 16 \epsilon \simeq 8\lambda_1^2 \simeq 5.01\cdot 10^{-6} \lambda_3^{-2}\qquad\text{for}\qquad N_e=60.
\label{r}
\end{align}
Successful inflation not only gives rise to the correct spectral tilt and tensor fraction but does so at the right energy scale. The normalization of scalar density perturbations in these models can be written as: 
\begin{align}
\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \left.\frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\phi_*} \simeq \frac{1}{12 \pi^2} \frac{V_{\rm ip}}{\lambda_1^2} \simeq 2.4 \cdot 10^{-9}\,.
\label{cobe}
\end{align}
Once the parameter $\lambda_3$ is fixed, (\ref{correctns}) gives the value of $\lambda_1$ which produces the correct spectral index, $n_s=0.965$, and (\ref{cobe}) fixes the value of $V_{\rm ip}$ which reproduces the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. In turn, (\ref{r}) yields the prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. 


\section{Microscopic Origin of the Inflationary Potential}
\label{SecOrigin}

In this section we will try to describe a possible microscopic origin of volume modulus inflation. The tree-level stabilization of the dilaton $S$ and of complex structure moduli proceeds as described in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ModuliStabilization}. In particular we will consider two explicit setups:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] \textit{Single modulus case} \\
In this setup we have a single K\"ahler modulus $T_b = \tau_b + {\rm i} c_b$ where $c_b$ is an axion field and $\tau_b$ controls the overall volume: ${V} = \tau_b^{3/2}$. The canonical normalization of the inflaton field $\tau_b$ can be inferred from its kinetic terms: 
\begin{align}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac{3}{4 \tau_b^2} \partial^\mu \tau_b \partial_\mu \tau_b\,,
\end{align}
so that the canonically normalized volume field can be written as:
\begin{align}
\Phi = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \ln \tau_b \simeq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \ln {V}\,.
\label{CanNorm}
\end{align}
In this setup the visible sector can be realized in two different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping the 4-cycle associated to $\tau_b$. Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is set by $\tau_b$ as $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}=\tau_b$, the late-time value of the volume has to be of order $100$ in order to reproduce a correct phenomenological value of $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}\simeq 25$. This model is characterized by high scale SUSY.

\item[ii)] The visible sector is localized on D3-branes at singularities obtained by collapsing a blow-up mode to zero size due to D-terms stabilization~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa, Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In this case the visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, and so the volume can take much larger values of order ${V} \simeq 10^7$ which lead to TeV-scale supersymmetry via sequestering effects. In the presence of desequestering perturbative or non-perturbative effects~\cite{Conlon:2010ji}, low-energy SUSY requires larger values of ${V}$ of order ${V}\sim 10^{14}$.
\end{itemize}

\item[b)] \textit{Two moduli case}\\
In this setup we start with two K\"ahler moduli: $T_b = \tau_b + {\rm i} c_b$ and $T_s = \tau_s + {\rm i} c_s$ with $\tau_b \gg \tau_s$. The CY volume takes the swiss-Cheese form:
\begin{align}
{V} = \tau_b^{3/2} - \tau_s^{3/2}\,.
\end{align} 
The modulus which plays the role of the inflaton will still be $\tau_b$, and so its canonical normalization is given by (\ref{CanNorm}). 
However, in this setup the visible sector can be realized in three different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping $\tau_b$ (for an explicit CY construction see~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg}). As explained above, in this case ${V}$ has to be of order $100$ for phenomenological reasons and the SUSY scale is very high.

\item[ii)] The visible sector lives on a stack of D7-branes wrapping $\tau_s$ (see again~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg} for an explicit model). Given that the visible sector gauge coupling is now independent on $\tau_b$ since $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}=\tau_s$, the volume can take large values. A particularly interesting value is ${V}\simeq 10^{14}$ which leads to TeV-scale soft-terms, as in standard non-sequestered LVS models. 

\item[iii)] The visible sector is localized on D3-branes at singularities (see~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha} for explicit global dS models) obtained by collapsing a blow-up mode to zero size due to D-terms stabilization. Since the gauge kinetic function of D3-branes is given by $S$, ${V}$ can take large values. Due to sequestering effects, in this case TeV-scale superpartners require ${V}\simeq 10^7$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{$\alpha'$-corrections}

If $W_0\neq 0$, the no-scale structure is broken by $\alpha'^3$-corrections which show up in the K\"ahler potential as in eq. \eqref{eq:AlphaPrimeKahlerPotential}. The contribution of the $\alpha'$-correction to the scalar potential looks like: 
\begin{align}
V = e^K \left(K^{T_b \overline{T}_b} D_{T_b} W D_{\overline{T}_b} \overline{W} - 3 |W|^2 \right) \supset V_0 \,e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} \equiv V_{\alpha'}\,,
\label{Va}
\end{align}
where we have defined:
\begin{align}
V_0 = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \frac{3 \hat{\xi} |W_0|^2}{4}\,.
\label{eq:V0}
\end{align}
$V_0$ is a free parameter which can be tuned to get inflection point inflation with the right COBE normalization and a large volume minimum.

\subsubsection{Non-perturbative Effects}

Given that non-perturbative effects are exponentially suppressed, they tend to give rise to negligible contributions to the scalar potential. However, in the two moduli case, $T_s$-dependent non-perturbative effects could lead to potentially large contributions, as in the LVS setup, described in Sec.~\ref{sssec:LVS}. 
With the right normalization the LVS potential takes the form:
\begin{align}
V = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left(\frac{8  a_s^2 A_s^2 \sqrt{\tau_s} e^{-2 a_s \tau_s}}{3 {V}} - \frac{4 W_0 a_s A_s \tau_s e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{{V}^2} + \frac{3 \hat{\xi} W_0^2}{4 {V}^3}\right).
\label{eq:LVSScalarPotentialGs}
\end{align}
Integrating out $\tau_s$ from the scalar potential in eq. \eqref{eq:LVSScalarPotentialGs} we get an effective potential which depends only on the volume ${V}$:
\begin{align}
V = \frac{V_0}{{V}^3} \left[1 - \frac{2}{\hat\xi a_s^{3/2}} \left(\ln {V}\right)^{3/2}\right]\,.
\label{effectivepotentialLVS}
\end{align}
The first term in (\ref{effectivepotentialLVS}) is just the $\alpha'$-correction (\ref{Va}) whereas the second term leads to a new non-perturbative contribution to the scalar potential:
\begin{align}
V_{\rm np} = - \kappa_{\rm np} V_0 \,\Phi^{3/2}\,e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} \qquad\text{with}\qquad 
\kappa_{\rm np}=\frac{2}{\xi}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi^2}\right)^{3/4}\left(g_s N\right)^{3/2}\,.
\label{Vnp}
\end{align}
Note that $\kappa_{\rm np}$ is another parameter that can be tuned to get inflection point inflation with the right COBE normalization and number of e-foldings.


\subsubsection{Higher Derivative $\alpha'$-corrections}
\label{sssec:HigherDerivativeAlphaCorrections}

Additional contributions to the scalar potential from higher derivative corrections to the 10D action have been computed in~\cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. These corrections have the same higher dimensional origin as the $\alpha'^3$-term (\ref{Va}). Both stem from the $\alpha'^3 {R}^4$ contribution to the in 10D Type IIB action. The effect of these four derivative corrections is to modify the equations of motion of the auxiliary fields (F-terms) thereby giving rise to corrections to the kinetic terms, new quartic derivative couplings and more importantly new contributions to the scalar potential.  These $F^4$ corrections depend on the CY topology and take the generic form:
\begin{align}
V_{F^4} = - \frac{\hat{\lambda} |W_0|^4}{{V}^4} \Pi_i t^i\,,
\label{v1}
\end{align}
where $\Pi_i$ are topological integers defined as:
\begin{align}
\Pi_i = \int_X c_2 \wedge \hat{D}_i\,,
\end{align}
with $c_2$ the second Chern class of the CY $X$ and $\hat{D}_i$ is a basis of harmonic $(1,1)$-forms allowing for the usual expansion of the K\"ahler form $J$ as:
\begin{align}
J = \sum_{i=1}^{h^{(1,1)}} t_i \hat{D}_i\,,
\end{align}
with $t^i$ being two-cycle volumes. The parameter $\hat{\lambda}$ is expected to be of order $\hat{\xi}/\chi(X)$, with $\chi(X)$ being the CY Euler number. For model building purposes, we will take it to be a real negative constant.\\

Depending on the details of the compactification space, these new terms can take different forms, yielding contributions to the scalar potential that scale differently with the overall volume. In the simplest single K\"ahler modulus case where $t_b = \sqrt{\tau_b} \simeq {V}^{1/3}$, the correction \eqref{v1} takes the form:
\begin{align}
V_{F^4} =  \frac{\kappa_{F^4}\,V_0}{{V}^{11/3}} = \kappa_{F^4}\, V_0\,e^{-\frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\,,
\label{VF4}
\end{align}
where we defined:
\begin{align}
\kappa_{F^4} \equiv - \hat{\lambda}  \Pi_b \frac{|W_0|^4}{V_0}\,.
\end{align}
The form of these corrections for the two moduli case can be derived by focusing on the $\mathbb{C} \rm{P}^4_{[1,1,1,6,9]}$ case where the volume can be written in terms of the two-cycle volumes $t_1$ and $t_5$ as~\cite{Denef:2004dm}:
\begin{align}
{V} = \frac{1}{6} (3 t_1^2 t_5 + 18 t_1 t_5^2 + 26 t_5^3)\,,
\end{align}
implying that the four-cycles are given by:
\begin{align}
\tau_1 = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_1} = t_5 (t_1 + 3 t_5) \quad\text{and}\quad \tau_5 = \frac{\partial {V}}{\partial t_5} = \frac{1}{2} (t_1 + 6 t_5)^2\,.
\end{align}
One can define $\tau_4$ as the linear combination:
\begin{align}
\tau_4 = \tau_5 - 6 \tau_1 = \frac{t_1^2}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_1 = \sqrt{2 \tau_4}\,.
\end{align}
Plugging $t_1$ back into the expression for $\tau_5$, solving the equation for $t_5$ and requiring that $t_5 > 0$ when $\tau_5 \gg \tau_4$ we get:
\begin{align}
t_5 = \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2}} \left(\sqrt{\tau_5} - \sqrt{\tau_4}\right),
\end{align}
from which it can be inferred that the volume has the form:
\begin{align}
{V} = \frac{1}{9 \sqrt{2}} \left(\tau_b^{3/2} - \tau_s^{3/2}\right),
\end{align}
where we identified $\tau_5 \equiv \tau_b$ and $\tau_4 \equiv \tau_s$. Thus the $\alpha'$-correction of \eqref{v1} becomes:
\begin{align}
V_{F^4} \simeq V_0 \left(\frac{\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}}}{{V}^{11/3}} + \frac{\kappa_{F^4_{(s)}} \sqrt{\tau_s}}{{V}^4}\right),
\label{deltav1}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}} = - \hat\lambda  \Pi_5 \frac{|W_0|^4}{6^{1/3} V_0} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \kappa_{F^4_{(s)}} = -\hat\lambda \sqrt{2} \left(\Pi_4 - \frac{\Pi_5}{6}\right) \frac{|W_0|^4}{V_0} \,.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{String Loop Corrections}

As we have observed in Sec.~\ref{sssec:CorrectionsToTreeLevel} the \Kahler potential receives string loop corrections as in eq. \eqref{eq:KKStringLoopCorrections} and eq. \eqref{eq:WindingStringLoopCorrections}. The final contribution to the scalar potential can be written as:
\begin{align}
V_{g_s} = \sum_{i = 1}^{h^{(1,1)}} \frac{|W_0|^2}{{V}^2} \left(g_s^2 \left(\mathcal{C}^{\rm KK}_i\right)^2 \frac{\partial^2 K_0}{\partial \tau_i^2} - 2 \delta K^{\rm W}_{(g_s)}\right).
\label{slccontributiontov}
\end{align}
Noting that $\partial^2 K_0/\partial\tau_b^2 = 3/(4 \tau_b^2)$, it turns out that in both scenarios the leading order string loop correction looks like:
\begin{align}
V_{g_s} = \frac{\kappa_{g_s}\,V_0}{{V}^{10/3}} = \kappa_{g_s}\,V_0\,e^{-\frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\,,
\label{Vgs}
\end{align}
where $\kappa_{g_s}$ is a real tunable number.

\subsubsection{Anti D3-branes}

Anti D3-branes yield a positive contribution to the scalar potential which in general provides a viable mechanism to realize a dS minimum. More precisely, the introduction of anti D3-branes in the compactification produces a term in the scalar potential of the form~\cite{Kachru:2003aw}:
\begin{align}
V_{\overline{D3}} = \frac{\kappa_{\overline{D3}}\,V_0}{{V}^2} = \kappa_{\overline{D3}}\,V_0\,e^{-\sqrt{6}\Phi}\,,
\label{VD3}
\end{align}
where $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ is a positive real number which can be tuned to realize inflection point inflation.

\subsubsection{Charged Hidden Matter Fields}

The possible presence on the big cycle of a hidden sector with matter fields $\phi$ charged under an anomalous $U(1)$ leads to the generation of moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms. The corresponding D-terms potential reads:
\begin{align}
V_D = \frac{1}{2 \text{Re}(f_b)} \left(q_{\phi} |\phi|^2 - \xi_b\right)^2\,,
\end{align} 
where $f_b = T_b$ and $q_\phi$ is the $U(1)$-charge of $\phi$ while the FI-term is given by:
\begin{align} 
\xi_b = - \frac{q_b}{4 \pi} \frac{\partial K_0}{\partial T_b} = \frac{3 q_b}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{align} 
where $q_b$ the $U(1)$-charge of $T_b$. Since supersymmetry breaking effects generate a mass for $\phi$ of order the gravitino mass, the total scalar potential becomes:
\begin{align}
V = V_D + c m_{3/2}^2 |\phi|^2 + {O}\left({V}^{-3}\right),
\end{align}
where $c$ is an ${O}(1)$ coefficient which can be positive or negative depending on hidden sector model building details.
Integrating out $\phi$ leads to a new contribution which has been used to obtain dS vacua and takes the form~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw, Cicoli:2013cha}:
\begin{align}
V_{\rm hid} = \frac{\kappa_{\rm hid}\,V_0}{{V}^{8/3}} = \kappa_{\rm hid}\,V_0\,e^{-\frac{8}{\sqrt{6}}\Phi}\,,
\label{vds2}
\end{align}
where $\kappa_{\rm hid} = \frac{3 c q_b W_0^2}{16 \pi q_\phi V_0}$ is a tunable coefficient.\footnote{Note that $q_b$ and $q_\phi$ must have the same sign otherwise the minimum for $|\phi|$ would be at zero.}


\subsubsection{Total Scalar Potential}

The total scalar potential that we shall consider can in general be written as:
\begin{align}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{\alpha'} + V_{\rm np} +  V_{F^4} + V_{g_s} + V_{\overline{D3}} + V_{\rm hid}\,,
\label{Vtot}
\end{align}
where $V_{\alpha'}$ is the universal $\alpha'$-correction (\ref{Va}), $V_{\rm np}$ is the non-perturbative generated potential (\ref{Vnp}) which is non-negligible only in the two moduli case, $V_{F^4}$ are the higher derivative effects (\ref{VF4}) and (\ref{deltav1}), $V_{g_s}$ is the string loop potential (\ref{Vgs}), $V_{\overline{D3}}$ is the contribution (\ref{VD3}) from anti D3-branes and $V_{\rm hid}$ is the potential (\ref{vds2}) generated by the F-terms of charged hidden matter fields.\\

Let us now add all these different contributions to the total scalar potential for the single modulus and the two moduli case separately: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] \textit{Single modulus case}\\
In this simple model with only a single K\"ahler modulus, the generic expression for the scalar potential is:
\begin{align}
V(\Phi) = V_0 \left(e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} + \kappa_{g_s} \,e^{- \frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{F^4} \,e^{- \frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} 
+ \kappa_{\overline{D3}} \,e^{- {\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{\rm hid} \,e^{- \frac{8}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi}\right).
\label{V1}
\end{align}
In this setup the post-inflationary dS minimum is generated by the interplay between the universal $\alpha'^3$ term and the two terms proportional to $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ and $\kappa_{\rm hid}$, with the inflationary inflection point arising at smaller volumes in a region where the first three terms in \eqref{V1} are comparable in size. 

\item[b)] \textit{Two moduli case}\\
In the two moduli case, the total scalar potential (\ref{Vtot}) contains at least six terms. However, as we shall see in the next section, we need just five tunable parameters in order to get inflection point inflation. We shall therefore neglect the last term in (\ref{Vtot}) which might be removed by a model building choice. We stress that this choice does not affect our final results. In fact, if instead we neglected $V_{\overline{D3}}$ in (\ref{Vtot}), we would obtain qualitatively the same results. Thus in this case the total inflationary potential becomes:
\begin{align}
V(\Phi) = V_0 \left[\left(1 - \kappa_{\rm np} \Phi^{3/2}\right) e^{-\sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} \Phi} + \kappa_{g_s} \,e^{-\frac{10}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} 
+ \kappa_{F^4_{(b)}} \,e^{-\frac{11}{\sqrt{6}} \Phi} + \kappa_{\overline{D3}}\, e^{- \sqrt{6} \Phi}\right].
\label{V2}
\end{align}
Here we are including only the leading term of the higher derivatives corrections \eqref{deltav1} which is proportional to $\kappa_{F^4_{(b)}}$. Hence we are assuming that the term proportional to $\kappa_{F^4_{(s)}}$ is either very suppressed (a natural possibility given its volume scaling) or exactly vanishing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Single Field Dynamics}
\label{SecSingle}

In this section we study the effective single field inflationary dynamics for both the single modulus and the two moduli case. A deeper analysis of the effect of the heavy field for the two moduli case will be performed in Sec.~\ref{SecTwo}. In order to obtain a phenomenologically viable model, we should require that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is an inflection point at $\Phi_{\rm ip}$.
\item The potential is such that the COBE normalization is satisfied and the number of e-foldings is $N_e \simeq 60$.
\item There is a large volume de Sitter minimum at $\Phi_{\rm min}$.
\end{enumerate}
As we will see below, these requirements translate into five conditions on the scalar potential, and so we need five tunable free parameters.


\subsection{Analytical Discussion}

As a first step, let us discuss the strategy used to determine the free parameters in \eqref{V1} and \eqref{V2} in order to get inflection point inflation. The position of the inflection point $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and the minimum $\Phi_{\rm min}$ can be chosen independently with the only constraint (apart from $\Phi_{\rm min}>\Phi_{\rm ip}$) being:
\begin{align}
\vo_{\rm ip} = e^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \Phi_{\rm ip}} \gtrsim 10^3\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad\Phi_{\rm ip} \gtrsim 5\,,
\end{align}
in order to trust the effective field theory during inflation.\\

Once $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and $\Phi_{\rm min}$ are chosen, we impose that the scalar potential actually produces an inflection point and the late time minimum at the desired positions. This can be done by scanning over flux parameters, intersections numbers and gauge groups so that the following constraints are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Inflection point}
\begin{align}
&(1)\quad\left.V''\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} = 0 \label{eq:cond1}\\
&(2)\quad\left. V' \cdot V'''\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} = \left.\frac{2 \pi^2 V^2}{(170)^2}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}}\label{eq:cond2}
\end{align}
\item \textit{Late time minimum}
\begin{align} 
&(3) \quad \left.V'\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm min}} = 0 \label{eq:cond3}\\
&(4) \quad \left.V\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm min}} = 0 \label{eq:cond4}
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
The first two conditions produce an inflection point at $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ with the right slope to yield a scalar spectral tilt around $n_s = 0.96$, while the last two conditions imply the existence of a Minkowski minimum at $\Phi_{\rm min}$. These conditions are invariant under a rescaling of $V_0$ in \eqref{V1} and \eqref{V2} since it is just an overall multiplicative factor in the scalar potential. $V_0$ is instead fixed by the requirement of obtaining the right COBE normalization given by \eqref{cobe} which can also be rewritten as:
\begin{align}
(5) \quad \Delta^2 = \left.\frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_*} \simeq \left.\frac{1}{12 \pi^2} \frac{V^3}{\left(V'\right)^2}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_{\rm ip}} \simeq 2.4 \cdot 10^{-9}\,.
\end{align}
Given the definition of $V_0$ in \eqref{eq:V0}, condition (5) can be seen as a constraint on the magnitude of the flux superpotential $W_0$ which in Type IIB string compactifications naturally lies in the range $[0.1,\,100]$. We will show now how additional constraints on $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ arise from combining this naturalness criterion with the requirement of low-energy supersymmetry. In fact we shall carefully choose $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ so that the COBE normalization fixes $W_0$ in the natural range mentioned above. Fixing $W_0$ through the condition (5) sets also the energy scale of the soft-terms. Here we distinguish between two possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Non-sequestered models}: If the cycle supporting the visible sector is stabilized in geometric regime, the soft-terms are of order the gravitino mass:
\begin{align}
M_{\rm soft} \simeq m_{3/2} \simeq \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{8 \pi} }\frac{W_0}{\vo_{\rm min}}\,.
\label{eq:unseq}
\end{align}
This is usually referred to as the non-sequestered case which for $W_0\sim 1$ leads to TeV-scale supersymmetry only for values of the volume as large as ${V}\sim 10^{14}$. This is possible for the two moduli case where the value of the visible sector coupling does not depend on ${V}$. In the single modulus case, since $\alpha_{\rm vis}^{-1}={V}^{2/3}$, the volume has to be of order $100$, resulting necessarily in a high-scale SUSY scenario.

\item \textit{Sequestered models}: If the visible sector modulus is fixed in the singular regime, the soft-terms can be very suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass: 
\begin{align}
M_{\rm soft} \simeq \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}} \simeq \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}} \frac{W_0}{\vo_{\rm min}^2}\,.
\label{eq:seq}
\end{align}
This is usually referred to as the sequestered scenario which for $W_0\sim 1$ leads to low-energy supersymmetry only for ${V}\sim 10^7$. In these sequestered models supersymmetry is broken in the bulk of the extra-dimensions while the visible sector lives on branes localized at a singularity. Given that in this case the visible sector coupling is set by the dilaton, this scenario can be realized both in the single and in the two moduli case.
\end{itemize}
The magnitude of the flux superpotential that satisfies condition (5) for a generic inflection point $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ can be estimated by noting that at horizon exit $\epsilon\sim 10^{-10}$ and there is a percent level cancellation between the three dominant terms. This implies that at the inflection point $V\sim 0.01\ V_0 \ e^{-\sqrt{27/2}\Phi_{\rm ip}}$, and so the Hubble scale can be estimated as:
\begin{align}
\label{hubbleestimate}
H = \sqrt{\frac{V_{\rm ip}}{3 M_{\rm P}^2}} \simeq \frac{1}{10 \sqrt{3}} \frac{\sqrt{V_0 M_{\rm P}^2}}{\vo_{\rm ip}^{3/2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\xi}{2 \pi g_s^{1/2}}} \frac{W_0 M_{\rm P}}{40 \vo_{\rm ip}^{3/2}}\,,
\end{align}
where we used \eqref{eq:V0} and we restored the correct dependence on the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$. Using the same argument we can also estimate the amplitude of the scalar perturbations in \eqref{cobe} as:
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{V}{\epsilon}\right|_{\Phi = \Phi_*}\simeq \frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \frac{0.01\ V_0 \ e^{-\sqrt{27/2}\Phi_{\rm ip}}}{10^{-10}}
\simeq 2.4 \times 10^{-9}\,,
\end{align}
which yields:
\begin{align}
W_0^2\simeq 7.58 \times 10^{-15}\ 8 \pi \sqrt{g_s} \, \, e^{\sqrt{27/2}\ \Phi_{\rm ip}}\,.
\label{eq:w0}
\end{align}
Assuming $g_s\simeq 0.1$, we conclude that only inflection points in the range $\Phi_{\rm ip} \in [6,\,10]$ are compatible with natural values of $W_0$.\\

We can take these simple estimates further and for each $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ obeying \eqref{eq:w0} find the position of the late time minimum $\Phi_{\rm min}$ that gives rise to TeV-scale soft masses in both sequestered and non-sequestered scenarios. For the sequestered case we have:
\begin{align}
\frac{g_s}{8 \pi}\ W_0^2 \ e^{-2 \sqrt{6}\ \Phi_{\rm min}}\simeq 10^{-30}\,,
\end{align}
which by using \eqref{eq:w0} becomes:
\begin{align}
\Phi_{\rm min}\simeq 6.76 +\frac{3}{4}\Phi_{\rm ip}\,.
\label{eq:est_seq}
\end{align}
A similar estimate for the non-sequestered case yields:
\begin{align}
\Phi_{\rm min}\simeq 13.51 +\frac{3}{2}\Phi_{\rm ip}\,.
\label{eq:est_unseq}
\end{align}
Hence we see that the distance between the inflection point and the minimum in the non-sequestered case is exactly twice the corresponding distance in the sequestered setup. The factor of two descends directly from the extra volume suppression of \eqref{eq:seq} when compared with \eqref{eq:unseq}. In both cases the combination of the observational constraint on the amplitude of the density perturbations, the theoretical bias on natural values of $W_0$ and the requirement of TeV-scale soft-terms conspire to fix the distance between the inflationary inflection point and the late-time minimum.\\

Tables~\ref{tab1} and~\ref{tab2} illustrate some reference values obtained using \eqref{eq:w0} to fix the inflection point for different values of $W_0$, and then \eqref{eq:est_unseq} and \eqref{eq:est_seq} to get the late-time minimum in the non-sequestered (Tab.~\ref{tab1}) and sequestered (Tab.~\ref{tab2}) scenarios respectively.

\label{tab2}
\end{table}

Using the values listed in Tab.~\ref{tab1} and~\ref{tab2} to estimate the Hubble scale as in \eqref{hubbleestimate} we get $H \simeq 10^{10}$ GeV which corresponds to an inflationary scale of order $10^{14}$ GeV. This result can also be obtained numerically using the more precise values listed in the next section.\\

Let us comment on the consistency of our effective field theory approach. As derived in~\cite{Cicoli:2013swa}, the superspace derivative
expansion is under control if $m_{3/2}\ll M_{\rm KK}$ which translates into the bound:
\begin{align}
\delta \equiv \sqrt{\frac{g_s}{2}} \frac{W_0}{{V}^{1/3} } \ll 1\,.
\end{align}
This bound is satisfied in each case of Tab.~\ref{tab1} and~\ref{tab2} both around the inflection point and the late-time minimum. In fact, considering just the region around the inflection point (${V}$ becomes larger around the minimum and so this bound is stronger during inflation) and setting $g_s=0.1$, we have: $\delta\simeq 10^{-3}$ for $W_0=0.1$, $\delta\simeq 10^{-2}$ for $W_0=1$, $\delta\simeq5\cdot 10^{-2}$ for $W_0=10$ and $\delta\simeq 0.1$ for $W_0=100$.
Thus the superspace derivative expansion is under control, and so higher derivative $\alpha'$-corrections should naturally be suppressed. Therefore, as we shall show in the next section, we have to tune the coefficient of the $F^4$ $\alpha'$ terms (\ref{VF4}) and (\ref{deltav1}) to large values. However the fact that the expansion parameter $\delta$ turns out to be small, allows us to neglect further higher derivative corrections in a consistent way. 


\subsection{Numerical Results}

In this section we present a detailed numerical study of inflection point volume inflation. We start by focusing on the non-sequestered single modulus case with high-scale SUSY. In this case the late-time minimum is bound to be of order $100$, so that the evolution of the canonically normalized field $\Phi$ is very limited. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig.~\ref{smallvol}, it is possible to get an inflection point and a late-time minimum at the desired values. The scalar potential is plotted in Fig.~\ref{smallvol}. We require $\Phi_{\rm ip} = 3.5$ and $\Phi_{\rm min} = 4.2$, corresponding respectively to values of the volume $\vo_{\rm ip} \simeq 72$ and $\vo_{\rm min} \simeq 171$. These values are clearly too small to trust the effective field theory approach. However we shall still present the numerical results for this case for illustrative purposes, and shall focus later on cases with low-energy supersymmetry where the volume during and after inflation is larger and the supergravity effective theory is under much better control.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{smallvol}
\end{figure}

In this example it is possible to reproduce the correct value of the spectral index, as a consequence of the condition \eqref{eq:cond2}. We list in Tab.~\ref{tab0} the numerical results obtained for different positions of the inflection point and the late-time minimum for which we get always $n_s \simeq 0.96$.
\begin{table}[H]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Numerical results for the coefficients of the scalar potential for the single modulus case with the visible sector on D7-branes wrapping the volume cycle.}
\label{tab0}
\end{table}

$\Delta \Phi$ is the field excursion of the canonically normalized volume modulus $\Phi$ between horizon exit and the end of inflation. Since $\Delta \Phi\sim 0.1 M_{\rm P}$ we are clearly dealing with a small field inflationary model. Thus the tensor-to-scalar ratio is of order $r \simeq 10^{-10}$. The values of $W_0$ reported in Tab.~\ref{tab0} are the numerical results which satisfy the COBE normalization. The corresponding Hubble scale in each case is $H \simeq 10^9$ GeV which translates into an inflationary scale around $10^{14}$ GeV.\\

We now turn to study the two more interesting sequestered and non-sequestered cases with larger values of the volume and TeV-scale supersymmetry. 
Since in both cases the shape of the scalar potential is always qualitatively the same around the inflection point and the late-time minimum, we plot it in Fig.~\ref{SingleFieldNonSequestered1} just for the non-sequestered case.\\

The numerical results listed below are obtained requiring that the inflection point and the late-time minimum are those given in Tab.~\ref{tab1} and~\ref{tab2} where we required natural values of $W_0$ and low-energy supersymmetry in both non-sequestered and sequestered cases. The tensor-to-scalar ratio turns out to be always of order $r \simeq 10^{-9}$. In the following tables the only inputs are $\Phi_{\rm ip}$ and $\Phi_{\rm min}$, while $W_0$, $\kappa_{g_s}$, $\kappa_{F^4}$ (or $\kappa_{F^4_{\rm (b)}}$), $\kappa_{\rm hid}$, $\kappa_{\overline{D3}}$ and $\kappa_{\rm np}$ are the numerical outputs obtained by solving \eqref{eq:cond1} and \eqref{eq:cond4}. As a consequence of the condition \eqref{eq:cond2}, the value of the spectral index is $n_s \simeq 0.967$ in each of the cases listed below.

Two important observations can be inferred from the values of the coefficients listed in Tab.~\ref{tab1} and~\ref{tab4}. The first one is that $\kappa_{g_s}$ is always required to be negative. In our models the negative sign can be obtained by the interplay of the two terms in \eqref{slccontributiontov}. Moreover the presence of the inflection point is highly sensitive to small variations of the coefficients in Tab.~\ref{tab3},~\ref{tab4},~\ref{tab5} and~\ref{tab6}. Thus in order to accurately reproduce the shape of the scalar potential in each case, it is necessary to tune the coefficients to a much higher level of precision than that reported in the Tables.
\end{itemize}

\section{Two Fields Dynamics}
\label{SecTwo}

Up to this point we have dealt exclusively with the single field limit, implicitly assuming that all other moduli, like the axio-dilaton, the complex structure moduli and additional K\"ahler moduli, are heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation. While this may be arranged for in the single K\"ahler modulus case, it is certainly not true for the model constructed within the LVS framework. In this section we comment on various aspects of the two field dynamics of this model.\\

As shown in Sec.~\ref{SecOrigin}, the effective single field potential of \eqref{V2} is obtained after integrating out the small blow-up modulus $\tau_s$. This procedure is valid in the vicinity of the LVS minimum where there is a clear mass hierarchy:
\begin{align}
m_{\tau_s}^2 \sim \frac{g_s}{8\pi}\frac{W_0^2}{\vo_{\rm min}^2} \gg \frac{g_s}{8\pi}\frac{W_0^2}{\vo_{\rm min}^3} \sim m_{\tau_b}^2\,,
\end{align}
however it fails around the inflection point where both fields are very light $m_{\tau_s}^2, m_{\tau_b}^2 \ll H^2 $, implying that both will be dynamical during inflation. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:2FieldLVS_pot}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\label{fig:2FieldLVS_pot}
\end{figure}

Due to the flatness of the scalar potential along both directions, the correct way to analyze the system is by numerically solving the background field equations as done in the original work~\cite{Conlon:2008cj}. Here we will extend the aforementioned analysis by studying the sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions in a given potential and by clarifying to what extent the single field results constitute a valid approximation to the inflationary observables. The reader looking for more details of the setup is referred to~\cite{Conlon:2008cj} as we will focus only on the results obtained.\\

We proceed in the same spirit of the single field analysis by choosing the coefficients that induce an inflection point along the volume direction. For concreteness we choose $(\tau_b,\tau_s)|_{\rm ip}=(1000,20)$. We then consider a set of initial conditions around that point and numerically solve the equations of motion. In Fig.~\ref{fig:2FieldLVS} we plot the solutions for the different choices of initial positions for the system. We assume throughout that the fields are released with vanishing velocities and find that the sensitivity to the initial position, that is characteristic of inflection point models, is magnified in the two field setup as perturbing the initial conditions by a small amount can lead to drastically different outcomes. Starting uphill from the inflection point tends to lead to trajectories that produce insufficient expansion. In some cases, depending on the ratio $\tau_s^{\rm ip}/\tau_s^{\rm min}$, some of these trajectories can lead to the collapse of the compact manifold to vanishing volume. For trajectories that start downhill from the tuned point, it is easier to obtain a viable post inflationary evolution, with the system evolving towards the LVS minimum, but the number of e-foldings decreases drastically with the distance from the tuned point. One is therefore led to the conclusion that viable inflationary trajectories are obtained only in a narrow region around $\tau_b^{\rm ip}$ and $\tau_s\gtrsim \tau_s^{\rm ip}$.\\

In what concerns inflationary observables in the two field setup one expects the projection along the inflationary trajectory (and hence the single field estimates of Sec.~\ref{SecSingle}) to be a good approximation to the full result. This follows directly from the fact that the observable portion of the trajectories yielding $N_e\ge 60$, is rather straight, as can be seen by the smallness of the inverse curvature radius plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:2FieldLVS}. This implies that curvature and isocurvature perturbations are essentially decoupled and that a straightforward generalization of the single field case leads to an accurate estimate of the cosmological observables.\footnote{For thorough discussion of this issue in the context of a local string inflation model see~\cite{Bielleman:2015lka}.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{SecConcl}

It has long been acknowledged that there is severe tension between having simultaneously low-scale supersymmetry and high scale inflation in supergravity models. This is due to the fact that the inflationary energy density contributes to the moduli potential and will in generally tend to destabilize them.\\

Several mechanisms to decrease or eliminate this tension have been proposed over the years and in this thesis we further develop the proposal of~\cite{Conlon:2008cj}. This particular model solves the tension between TeV-scale supersymmetry and the inflationary scale by having an evolving compactification volume between the inflationary epoch and today. Inflation is due to an inflection point in the volume direction of the scalar potential which also possesses a minimum at large volume where the modulus is supposed to sit at late-time after inflation. In order to prevent overshooting it is necessary to require that a small amount of radiation is generated after the end of inflation. The presence of this additional radiation is well justified in the two field model since it could be produced by the oscillations of the heavy modulus around its minimum while in the single field model particle production could be induced by a changing vacuum state between the end of inflation and today.\\

In this chapter we described a possible microscopic origin of the inflationary scalar potential that allows the gravitino mass to vary after the end of inflation and at the same time features a late-time dS minimum. In particular, we provided an explicit construction where the inflationary inflection point is generated by the interplay between string loops and higher derivative $\alpha'$-corrections to the scalar potential. Moreover, we supplemented the LVS construction with a new model that involves only one K\"ahler modulus. While in the LVS two moduli model non-perturbative effects play a crucial r\^ole in determining the presence of both the inflection point and the late-time minimum, in the single modulus model non-perturbative effects are absent and an additional contribution arising from the F-terms of charged hidden matter is needed. For both models we analyzed the relation between the value of the volume during inflation and at present with the size of the flux superpotential $W_0$. We found that if $W_0$ takes natural values, the distance between the inflection point and the late-time minimum is fixed.\\

We finally studied the full dynamics of the two field system in the LVS model and showed that, after tuning the potential such that it features the desired inflection point, there is a significant sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions. Perturbing the starting positions of the fields even by a small amount can lead to a radically different cosmological evolution. We also showed that, despite the presence of two dynamical fields, the predictions for the cosmological observables derived in the single field case are accurate since the field space trajectories are essentially straight over the last $60$ e-foldings of expansion.

\part{Conclusions}

\chapter{Summary and final remarks}

Let us conclude by providing a brief summary of the contents and of the results reported in this thesis.\\

In Chap.~\ref{chap:StateOfArt} we first presented a brief report of the current status of particle physics and cosmology. We also presented a quick overview of the possible alternatives for the physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing specially on supersymmetric theories. In the second part of the same chapter we presented string theory as the best candidate for a unified theory of all interactions, which describes also gravity at the quantum level in a consistent way. After having described its main features, we discussed the role of string phenomenology in the current search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.\\

In Chap.~\ref{chap:Compactifications&ModelBuilding} we presented an overview of the generic tools needed for the study of string compactifications. More in detail, in the first part we have shown that some phenomenological requirements along with our poor computational skills restrict the choice of the compact space to a very specific class, among the infinity that are available. We have also summarized how to get a $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric effective field theory starting from the ten-dimensional action for massless string states. In general such an effective theory features the presence of many massless scalar fields, which are problematic from a phenomenological point of view. In the second part of the chapter we have shown how to connect this effective field theory with the real world. The main step is represented by moduli stabilization, which makes moduli massive and generally breaks supersymmetry. We used one of the most powerful techniques for moduli stabilization, which is called Large Volume Scenario. Finally we have described how to embed a chiral gauge theory using a stack of D3-branes on top of a singularity of the compact space. In the last part of the section we presented an explicit example of a string compactification in which the visible sector is consistently embedded in a global construction, and all the closed moduli are stabilized.\\

In Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms} we have computed the soft spectrum arising from sequestered compatifications~\cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}. We have shown that it is possible to get a MSSM-like spectrum only in a particular case in which the effective field theory is protected by an effective symmetry. In this case all the soft-terms have the same size, and they can be around $1 \,$ TeV without causing the cosmological moduli problem. In more generic situations the spectrum exhibits a hierarchy between gaugino masses and scalar masses, giving rise to Split-SUSY scenarios with gauginos around the TeV and scalars around $10^6-10^7 \,$ GeV. This is an interesting example of how string theory can act as a guidance among the myriads of beyond the Standard Model alternatives: Split-SUSY scenarios seem to be quite more natural than MSSM ones from a top-down perspective.\\

A model-independent feature of the sequestered models presented in Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms} is that the field whose VEV parametrizes the size of the compact extra-dimensions (\textit{volume modulus}) is always the lightest modulus. Due to its gravitational coupling the volume modulus decays late in the history of the universe and can modify significantly its cosmological evolution. In particular, if it decays after the freeze-out of thermally produced dark matter, it dilutes the previous abundance and produces a new amount of dark matter. In Chap.~\ref{chap:NonThermalDM} we performed a numerical study of the non-thermal dark matter production in the MSSM case of Chap.~\ref{chap:Soft-Terms} and we contrasted the results with the current experimental bounds~\cite{Aparicio:2015sda}. In the region of the parameter space which is not ruled out by experimental data, non-thermally produced dark matter saturates the observed relic abundance if the lightest supersymmetric particle is a higgsino-like neutralino with mass around $300$ GeV and the reheating temperature is about $2$ GeV.\\

Relativistic degrees of freedom in the hidden sector constitute the so-called dark radiation. The amount of dark radiation present in the universe can be constrained by CMB and BBN experiments, since the presence of additional relativistic degrees of freedom modifies the rate of expansion of the universe at early times. The existence of dark radiation is then a very promising window on beyond the Standard Model physics, and it is very interesting also from a string phenomenology point of view. Indeed, it provides a quite model-independent signature of string models, given that its existence is uniquely due to the presence of both hidden relativistic degrees of freedom and moduli, which are the four-dimensional manifestation of extra-dimensions. Hence it can be used either to rule out or to constrain entire classes of string compactifications. A generic feature of sequestered models is that the volume modulus decays into a massless axion-like field, which acts as dark radiation. In Chap.~\ref{chap:DR} we have shown that in Split-SUSY scenarios the dark radiation produced in sequestered models is within the current experimental bounds, provided that the decay of the volume modulus into scalars is kinematically allowed~\cite{Cicoli:2015bpq}.\\

%A deep open question in modern cosmology is to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe in a dynamical way. An interesting proposal which makes use of the dynamics of the MSSM  flat directions is the \textit{Affleck-Dine mechanism}. According to this mechanism, if a baryon-violating flat direction is tachyonic during inflation, it will end up in a condensate whose decay can give rise to the baryon asymmetric universe that we observe. Sequestered models turn out to be a natural framework for the Affleck-Dine mechanism and in Chap.~\ref{chap:ADB} we have provided an explicit embedding of that by making use of K\"ahler Moduli Inflation. Requiring at once a successful inflationary model, TeV gauginos and the measured amount of baryon asymmetry constrains both the reheating temperature $T_{\text{rh}} \gtrsim 100 \, \text{GeV}$ and the mass of scalar fields $m_0 \gtrsim 10^9 \, \text{GeV}$~\cite{ADBinLVS}.\\

In Chap.~\ref{chap:VolumeInflation} we studied the microscopic origin of a model of inflation in which the role of the inflaton is played by the volume modulus, called \textit{Volume Inflation}~\cite{Cicoli:2015wja}. This is a particularly interesting model because it provides a dynamical mechanism to overcome the well known tension between TeV soft-terms and high-scale inflation. It turns out that inflation is due to the interplay of quantum corrections to the scalar potential (both $\alpha'$ and string loop corrections) with contributions from anti-branes and/or from charged hidden matter. They give rise to an inflection point around which small-field inflation can take place. We have shown that requiring natural values for the parameters of the model and TeV scale soft-terms leads to a well defined relation between the value of the volume during inflation and its value in the late-time vacuum.\\

%Finally, I would like to emphasize that in the present thesis we exploited both the paradigmatic ideas of how to approach string phenomenology. The first idea consists in identifying string models' signatures which are as much model-independent as possible. This is the specific case of Dark Radiation: its presence is quite generic in string compactifications since it depends only on the existence of both extra-dimensions and hidden relativistic degrees of freedom. Once a model-independent signature has been identified, one can use it either to constrain or to rule out entire classes of string compactifications. String theory can be also used to explicitly check if a given effective model which describes some specific aspect of nature can be embedded in the unique consistent theory of quantum gravity available at the moment. This is the idea which guided us in trying to embed the Affleck-Dine mechanism in sequestered string scenarios. Again, this can be used to constrain or rule out classes of string compactifications, once the Affleck-Dine mechanism is required to work.\\

In general, the major open question is to exactly reproduce the Standard Model at low-energy from a class of string compactifications and to reconcile it with cosmological observations. This problem can be faced in vastly different ways depending on the desired pattern of supersymmetric particles, and hopefully in the near future new experimental data will help us in this task. In the present thesis we have observed that it is very hard to get a TeV MSSM spectrum (which could address the hierarchy problem) even in the most favored case in which the visible sector is placed on top of D3-branes at singularities. Hopefully in the near future we will understand whether it is actually worth addressing this problem or we should change our point of view on the naturalness issues.

\end{document}

In general all the single field models of inflation can be described by an Einstein frame Lagrangian that is similar to the one shown in Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:einstein_frame} i.e.\ by:
\begin{equation}
	\label{attractors:einstein_frame}
	\mathcal{S} = \int \textrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{2} - K(\phi)X -V_E(\phi)  \right] \ .
\end{equation}
A particular case are the so-called \emph{T-models}~\cite{Kallosh:2013hoa,Kaiser:2013sna,Kallosh:2013daa,Kallosh:2013tua,Kallosh:2013yoa,Kallosh:2014rga,Kallosh:2015lwa} which lead to the class of $\alpha$-attractors. \emph{T-models} are described by the action of Eq.~\eqref{attractors:einstein_frame} with:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tmodels}
	K(\phi) = \left(1 - \frac{\phi^2}{6 \alpha} \right)^{-2} \ , \qquad \qquad V_E(\phi) = \frac{m^2 \phi^2}{ 2} \ .
\end{equation}
Other interesting examples are the case of Higgs inflation introduce by Bezrukov and Shaposhnikov~\cite{Bezrukov:2007ep,Bezrukov:2009db} and its generalization. in terms of the so-called attractor at strong coupling~\cite{Kallosh:2013tua}: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{attractors:model_def}
	K(\phi) = \frac{1+\varsigma h(\phi) + 3/2 \, \varsigma^2 h_{,\phi}^2(\phi)}{(1+\varsigma h(\phi))^2} \ , \qquad \qquad V_E(\phi) = \lambda^4 \frac{ h^2(\phi)}{ \left( 1 + \varsigma h(\phi) \right)^2} \ ,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a mass scale (that fixes the normalization of the inflationary potential) and $h(\phi)$ is a generic function\footnote{Higgs inflation corresponds to $h(\phi)=\phi^2$.} of $\phi$.



Over the last years these models have received a lot of attention because they predict values of $n_s$ and $r$ that are in good agreement with the values that are favored by Planck data~\cite{Ade:2015xua,Ade:2015lrj}. In the case of T-models we have:
\begin{equation}
	n_s -1 = - \frac{2}{N} \ , \qquad \qquad r = \frac{12 \alpha}{N^2} \ ,
\end{equation}
and in the case of the attractor at strong coupling (i.e.~$\varsigma \gg 1$):
\begin{equation}
	n_s -1 = - \frac{2}{N} \ , \qquad \qquad r = \frac{12 }{N^2} \ .
\end{equation}
We can immediately notice that, for both these models:\footnote{However, it is crucial to stress that these expressions for $n_s -1$ and $r$ only hold for large values of $N$. This will be particularly relevant for the possibility of observing the GW spectrum generated by these models.}
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_H \simeq \frac{\mathcal{O}(1)}{N^2} \ .
\end{equation}
Interestingly, using the classification of inflation models~\cite{Mukhanov:2013tua,Roest:2013fha,Binetruy:2014zya} based on first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$:
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon_H \simeq \frac{\beta_p}{N^p} + \mathcal{O}(1/N^{p+1}) \ ,
\end{equation}
all these models fall in the same universality class (i.e.\ the Starobinsky-like class\footnote{The wording `Starobinsky-like' refers here to a class of models characterized by a scalar potential which asymptotes to an exponentially flat plateau. The original Starobinsky model~\cite{Starobinsky:1980te} is constructed from the Ricci-scalar which is not a pseudoscalar quantity.} with $p=2$). As shown in~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}, in the context of higher-dimensional couplings with Abelian gauge fields this happens to be the most promising scenario from the point of view of possible observational signatures. As a consequence it seems interesting apply the framework developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-minimal} to this class of models.



In order to study the effect of non-minimal couplings on the dynamics and on the scalar and tensor power spectra, we focus on the family of models defined by Eq.~\eqref{attractors:model_def}. As a first example, let us consider models with $h(\phi) = \phi$ so that:
\begin{equation}
	\label{attractors:model_example}
	K(\phi) = \frac{1+\varsigma \phi + 3/2 \, \varsigma^2 }{(1+\varsigma \phi)^2} \ , \qquad \qquad V_E(\phi) = \lambda^4 \frac{ \phi^2}{ \left( 1 + \varsigma \phi \right)^2} \ .
\end{equation}
Notice that for $\varsigma = 0 $ this model simply reduces to the case of chaotic inflation with $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2$ i.e.\ it corresponds to the $p=1$ class of~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}. 
By increasing the value of $\varsigma$ we progressively flatten the potential, see left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:potentials_and_xi}.\footnote{For all the models shown in this plot the constant $\lambda$ is fixed in order to respect the observed normalization of the scalar spectrum (according to~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}) at CMB scales. In particular this can be noticed by looking at the plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:scalar}, where we show the scalar spectra associated with all the different models discussed in this section.} This clearly induces a strong modification on the evolution of the inflaton field. In particular, the field excursion during inflation is decreased as $\varsigma$ increases and the evolution of $\xi$ is altered compared to the minimally coupled case (see right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:potentials_and_xi}).
 Notice that for increasing values of $\varsigma$ the growth of $\xi$ (as a function of $N$) becomes slower. In particular the suppression of $\xi$ over a wide range of e-folds leads to a strong suppression in both the scalar and tensor power spectra.

\label{fig:potentials_and_xi}
\end{figure}

 
As described in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-minimal}, the changes in the tensor spectrum are simply due to the different evolution of $\xi$. In particular, as for increasing values of $\varsigma$ the growth of $\xi$ becomes slower over a broad range of $N$-values, we expect the GW spectrum (which is exponentially sensitive to $\xi$) to be strongly suppressed. This effect is clearly visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:GW} where we compare the GW spectra for the models of Fig~\ref{fig:potentials_and_xi} with the sensitivity curves of some current (solid lines) and upcoming (dashed lines) direct GW detectors. For the millisecond pulsar timing arrays covering frequencies around $10^{-10}$~Hz, we show the constraint depicted in Ref.~\cite{Smith:2005mm}, the update from EPTA~\cite{vanHaasteren:2011ni} and the expected sensitivity of SKA~\cite{Kramer:2004rwa}. The laser interferometer space antenna (LISA)~\cite{LISA} is a future mission designed to probe the mHz range~\cite{Petiteau, Caprini:2015zlo,Bartolo:2016ami}, where as ground-based detectors are sensitive at a few 10 Hz (LIGO/VIRGO~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016wyq}). It is interesting to notice that for $\varsigma \sim 1$ the spectrum is marginally detectable (for $\mathcal{N}=10$) by LISA but not by advanced LIGO. For larger values of $\varsigma$ the suppression of the spectrum is so strong that the signal is well below the expected sensitivities of upcoming GW detectors.

Current bounds are denoted by solid lines, expected sensitivities of upcoming experiments by dashed lines. See main text for details on these curves.}
\label{fig:GW}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:scalar} we show the scalar power spectrum (corresponding to Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:scalar_final}) for all the models shown in the previous plots. Notice that, in order to respect the COBE normalization (that sets the amplitude of the spectrum  at CMB scales) all the spectra meet at the same value for $N\simeq 60$. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that all the models shown in this section are in agreement\footnote{Except for the model with $\varsigma = 0.01$, for which the predicted value of $r$ is marginally excluded by Planck~\cite{Ade:2015lrj} at $95\%$ CL.} with the constraints set by Planck on $n_s$ and $r$ and on the generation of primordial non-Gaussianities.\footnote{ This can directly be checked from Fig.~\ref{fig:potentials_and_xi}, $\xi|_\text{CMB} \lesssim 2.5$.} Interestingly, for none of the models shown in this plot the spectrum features a peak. This can be explained by considering the expression of $K(\phi)$ in terms of $N$. While for $\varsigma \ll 1 $ $K(\phi)$ is essentially constant, for sizable values of $\varsigma$ we have $K(\phi) \propto 1/(\varsigma N)^2$ to leading order in $N$. By numerically solving the evolution it is possible to show that $K(\phi)$ becomes large only for $N\simeq 2 \div 4 $ depending on the model, and the suppression of $\xi$ is not strong enough to disrupt its monotonic growth before the end of inflation. As a consequence, in order for the spectrum to feature a peak, we require a strong growth of $K(\phi)$ at sufficiently large values of $N$. Such a behavior can be achieved by considering different parameterizations for $h(\phi)$.

\label{fig:scalar}
\end{figure}



As discussed in Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}, the scalar and tensor spectra in axion inflation can be well understood in terms of universality classes of inflation~\cite{Mukhanov:2013tua,Roest:2013fha,Binetruy:2014zya}, categorized by the scaling of $\epsilon_H(N)$ in the regime where the back-reaction of the gauge fields is weak. This is immediately understood (for a minimal coupling to gravity) since the growth of both the scalar and tensor spectrum is driven by $\xi \propto \sqrt{\epsilon_H}$. However, when a non-minimal coupling is considered, the instability is controlled by $\xi \propto \sqrt{\epsilon_H/K}$ (see Eq.~\eqref{non_minimal:epsilon_H}). Whereas the examples depicted so far correspond to $\epsilon_H/K \propto 1/N^p$ with $p \lesssim 1$~\cite{Binetruy:2014zya},\footnote{While it is easy to see that $p = 1$ for $\varsigma = 0$ (see~\cite{Binetruy:2014zya}), this statement may seem surprising for $\varsigma \neq 1$, when the scalar potential asymptotically approaches the exponentially flat Starobinsky-like potential (that for a minimal coupling is characterized by $\epsilon_H \propto 1/N^2$~\cite{Binetruy:2014zya}). This subtlety arises due to the coupling of the gauge fields to the canonically normalized inflaton field of the Jordan frame. By considering the expression of $K(\phi)$ given in Eq.~\eqref{attractors:model_def} and using the definition $N \equiv \int \sqrt{K/2\epsilon_H} \, \textrm{d}\phi$, one finds that $\xi \propto \sqrt{\epsilon_H/K}$ is in fact independent of $N$ at small values of $N$ (ignoring here a possible black-reaction of the gauge-fields).} 
different behaviors can be achieved. In particular here, in order to obtain a scalar spectrum which rises at larger values of $N$ (i.e.\ at an earlier stage during inflation) we require a quicker increase of  $\epsilon_H(N)$, with decreasing $N$. At the same time, in order to obtain a suppression of $\xi$ which leads to the appearance of a bump in the spectra, we also require the kinetic function $K(N)$ to become sizable at sufficiently large values of $N$. A simple example of this type can obtained by choosing:
\begin{equation}
	\label{attractors:inv_definition}
 	h(\phi) = (1 - 1/\phi) \ , \qquad \qquad  V_E(\phi) = \lambda^4 \frac{ (\phi-1)^2}{ \left( \phi + \varsigma (\phi-1) \right)^2} \ ,
 \end{equation} 
 which for a vanishing non-minimal coupling and a vanishing coupling to gauge fields ($\varsigma = 0$, $\alpha = 0$) leads to $\epsilon_H \propto 1/N^{4/3}$ while the kinetic function $K(N)$ interpolates from an approximately constant behaviorw at large $N$ to $K(N) \propto e^{-N}$ at small $N$. We will also return to models of this type when discussing PBH dark matter.

\caption{Evolution of $\xi$ as a function of $N$ for models based on Eq.~\eqref{attractors:inv_definition}. The model parameters are chosen to obey CMB and PBH constraints, see main text for details. In particular,  the depicted curves are obtained for couplings to the gauge-fields of $\alpha/\Lambda \simeq \{ 97, 63, 71, 74 \}$ (for increasing value of the non-minimal coupling to gravity $\varsigma$, respectively).}
\label{fig:xi_inv}
%
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:xi_inv} we depict the evolution of the parameter $\xi$  for some representative models of the class defined by Eq.~\eqref{attractors:inv_definition}. As before, the normalization of the scalar potential is fixed by the COBE normalization that fixes the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at CMB scales and we ensure agreement with all CMB constraints. The remaining parameters are chosen to obtain sizable gauge-field induced effects while conveying an idea of the possible parameter space. 
 We clearly see the peaked features around $N \simeq 20 - 40$ in all spectra with a significant value of the non-minimal coupling $\varsigma$, which translates into a broad peak in the scalar and tensor spectra, depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra}.
For increasing values of $\alpha/\Lambda$ and $\varsigma$ the bump in the spectra shifts to larger values of $N$ i.e.\ to larger scales. This is consistent with the physical intuition: For larger values of $\alpha/\Lambda$ the increase in the spectrum arises earlier (see also~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}), for larger values of $\varsigma$ the subsequent suppression due to the non-canonically normalized kinetic term takes effect at earlier times.
Moreover, increasing $\varsigma$ we reduce the field excursion during inflation, leading to a suppression of $\xi$ over a broad range of $N$-values. As a consequence (and indeed consistently with Fig.~\ref{fig:GW} and Fig.~\ref{fig:scalar}), increasing the non-minimal coupling $\varsigma$ we note a suppression both in the scalar and tensor power spectra. For $\varsigma \simeq 63$ and $71$ the signal is below the predicted sensitivity of LISA by roughly an order of magnitude. Finally, we point out that the peaks in the scalar spectrum of Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra} correspond to values of $\xi \lesssim 4.6$. Contrary to the case of minimal coupling, we do hence not enter into the regime $\xi \gtrsim 4.8$ where perturbativity breaks down~\cite{Peloso:2016gqs} and where significant uncertainties become attached to the predictions for the scalar spectrum.

Let us conclude this section by summarizing the key feature of $K(\phi)$ and $V(\phi)$ which allow for the appearance of a peak in the spectra within the last 60 e-folds. A first requirement is that the instability occurs at sufficiently large values of $N$. This can be rephrased as the requirement that $\xi \propto \sqrt{\epsilon_H/K}$ grows sufficiently fast with decreasing $N$ for large values of $N$. After this first regime, we need the effects of the non-canonical kinetic term to become important. Concretely, in order to observe a bump in the spectra we require a rapid increase in $K(\phi)$ at a sufficiently large value of $N$ (for example at $N \simeq 20$). As the growth of $K(\phi)$ turns into a suppression of $\xi$, this mechanism shuts off the instability, leading to the appearance of a bump both in the scalar and tensor power spectra. To illustrate this we chose to study two example models as defined by Eq.~\eqref{attractors:model_def} and Eq.~\eqref{attractors:inv_definition}. However, one can also perform a more model-independent analysis. In particular, we can make predictions for the scalar and tensor spectra by directly parameterizing $K$ and $\epsilon_H$ as functions of $N$:
\begin{equation}
 	\epsilon_H \simeq \frac{\beta}{(1+N)^\alpha} \ , \qquad K \simeq 1 + \frac{\gamma}{N^\delta} \ .
 \end{equation} 
Note that one can always reconstruct the expressions for $V_E(\phi)$ and $K(\phi)$ by expressing $N$ as a function of $\phi$. Hence, in case of a detection of peaks in the scalar and tensor spectra one could determine the corresponding expressions for $V_E(\phi)$ and $K(\phi)$.

\section{Introduction}

A class of well-studied string inflationary models is Fibre Inflation (FI) whose name originates from the fact the inflaton is a type IIB K\"ahler modulus controlling the size of a K3 or $T^4$ fibre over a $\mathbb{P}^1$ base. These models have been built with the framework of Large Volume Scenarios \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Cicoli:2008va}. The inflaton is a leading order flat direction whose potential can be generated by different combinations of perturbative corrections: 1-loop open string Kaluza-Klein (KK) and winding effects \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, 1-loop KK corrections and higher order $\alpha'$ terms \cite{Broy:2015zba}, or 1-loop winding contributions and $\alpha'$ corrections \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. 

Besides moduli stabilisation, these models features several promising properties, including an approximate shift symmetry for the inflaton potential \cite{Burgess:2016owb, Burgess:2014tja}, global Calabi-Yau orientifold constructions with chiral matter \cite{Cicoli:2011it, Cicoli:2016xae, Cicoli:2017axo}, and a detailed understanding of the post-inflationary evolution. In particular, preheating effects turn out to be negligible \cite{Antusch:2017flz} while standard perturbative reheating \cite{Cabella:2017zsa, Cicoli:2018cgu} can lead to an epoch of radiation domination with initial temperature which is low enough to avoid any decompactification due to finite-temperature effects \cite{Anguelova:2009ht}. Together with Standard Model particles, the inflaton decay produces also ultra-light bulk axions behaving as extra relativistic species which contribute to $N_{\rm eff}$. 

Interestingly, the potential of FI models resembles Starobinsky inflation \cite{Starobinsky:1980te} and supergravity $\alpha$-attractors \cite{Kallosh:2013maa,Kallosh:2017wku} since it features a trans-Planckian plateau followed by a steepening at large inflaton values that can produce a CMB power loss at large scales \cite{Cicoli:2013oba, Pedro:2013pba, Cicoli:2014bja} and primordial black hole dark matter \cite{Cicoli:2018asa}. Moreover the extra-dimensional geometry constrains the inflaton field range to values of ${O}(5)$ in Planck units \cite{Cicoli:2018tcq}. This, in turn, translates in a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.01$. A recent work \cite{Cicoli:2020bao} determined the values of the microscopic parameters of FI models which give the best fit to most recent cosmological data, finding at $68\%$ CL $n_s = 0.9696^{+0.0010}_{-0.0026}$, $r = 0.00731^{+0.00026}_{-0.00072}$ and $N_{\rm eff} = 3.062^{+0.004}_{-0.015}$ (for Planck 2018 temperature and polarisation data only). 

Despite all these interesting features, it has been recently pointed out \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr, Cicoli:2019ulk} that FI models might be plagued by a geometrical instability \cite{Gong:2011uw,Renaux-Petel:2015mga}. More precisely, isocurvature perturbations associated to one of the two ultra-light axions typical of FI models, experience a growth during inflation triggered by the curvature of the underlying field space. At first sight, this effect might seem dangerous since it would bring the system away from the perturbative regime. However, as already noticed in \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk}, the background trajectory remains stable. 

In this paper we shall resolve this paradox by exploiting the analysis performed in \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb} that clarified which is the correct entropy variable that should be used to match the evolution of the isocurvature modes between inflation and radiation dominance. In fact, we shall show that the geometrical instability of FI models is just apparent since it is an artifact of the decomposition of a generic perturbation into modes tangent and orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory. The spurious nature of the instability resides in the fact that the normal unit vector diverges, while no tachyonic mass for the cosmological perturbations is seen when using the original field basis. According to the analysis performed in \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb}, we therefore used the proper variable, the relative entropy perturbation, which is both gauge invariant and finite, and found that isocurvature perturbations indeed decay during inflation, in full agreement with the fact that the background dynamics is stable and essentially single-field.

We therefore conclude that FI models are not plagued by any geometrical destabilisation effect, satisfy current isocurvature perturbation bounds, and the inflationary evolution of the system remains always in the regime where perturbation theory works very well. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{FibreReview} we first review the main features of FI models and the origin of the apparent destabilisation effect. In Sec. \ref{NoInst} we then show the absence of any instability by studying the evolution of the relative entropy perturbation. We finally present our conclusions in Sec. \ref{Conclusions}.



\section{A geometrical instability in Fibre Inflation?}
\label{FibreReview}

\subsection{Basics of Fibre Inflation}

All FI models are qualitatively very similar, and so, without loss of generality, we will focus on the original formulation \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} which involves type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications with fluxes, D3/D7-branes, O3/O7-planes and $h^{1,1}=3$ K\"ahler moduli $T_i=\tau_i +{\rm i} \theta_i$, $i=1,2,3$. The internal volume looks like:
\begin{equation}
{V}=\alpha(\tau_b \sqrt{\tau_f}-\lambda_s \tau_s^{3/2})\,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\lambda_s$ are ${O}(1)$ constants (which depend on the intersection numbers), $\tau_s$ is a blow-up mode, $\tau_b$ is the base modulus and $\tau_f$ controls the volume of the fibre K3 or $T^4$ divisor. In a large volume expansion, the moduli potential receives contributions at 3 different orders: ($i$) at leading order, $T_s$-dependent non-perturbative effects and ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections stabilise ${V}$, $\tau_s$ and $\theta_s$ at ${V}\gg 1$ giving them a mass larger than the Hubble scale during inflation; ($ii$) at subleading order KK and winding 1-loop open string effects develop the inflationary potential for $\tau_f$; ($iii$) the two axions $\theta_b$ and $\theta_f$ are almost massless and much lighter than $\tau_f$ since they become massive only via highly suppressed ${V}$-dependent non-perturbative effects. 

The inflationary potential in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton $\phi$ reads (setting the reduced Planck mass $M_p = 1$):
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm inf} = V_0\left[ 3-4 \,e^{-\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{3}} }  +  e^{-\frac{4\phi}{\sqrt{3}} }+ R\left(e^{\frac{2\phi}{\sqrt{3}} } - 1\right)\right],
\label{Vinf}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{g_s^{1/3} W_0^2 A}{8\pi \lambda^2 {V}^{10/3}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad
R = 16 g_s^4 \frac{AC}{B^2}\,,
\end{equation}
where, following the notation of \cite{Cicoli:2018cgu}, $g_s$ is the string coupling, $W_0$ is the flux-generated ${O}(10-100)$ superpotential, $A$, $B$ and $C$ are ${O}(1)$ flux-dependent coefficients of the string loop corrections, and $\lambda = (4A/B)^{2/3}$. The best fit analysis of \cite{Cicoli:2020bao} found $R<4.80\times 10^{-6}$ and $10^{11}\, V_0=6.76^{+0.25}_{-0.49}$ for Planck data alone at $68\%$ CL. Given that for $R<4.80\times 10^{-6}$, horizon exit occurs always in the plateau region where the term proportional to $R$ is negligible, in what follows we shall simply set $R=0$ (which would imply no power loss at large angular scales). In this case the relation between the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can approximated as $r\simeq 6 (n_s-1)^2$ which reproduces rather well the best fit values $n_s=0.9696^{+0.0010}_{-0.0026}$ and $r=0.00731^{+0.00026}_{-0.00072}$ found in \cite{Cicoli:2020bao}. Notice that such a large value of $r$ could be tested by the next generation of cosmological observations.

The reheating temperature from the inflaton decay $T_{\rm rh}$ can be written as $T_{\rm rh} = 3\,\gamma\cdot 10^{10}$ GeV where $\gamma = 2 \lambda \alpha_{\rm vis}  g_s^{4/3} {V}^{2/3}$ (with $\alpha_{\rm vis} = g^2/(4\pi)$) controls the branching ratio for the inflaton decay into visible sector gauge bosons and the ultra-light axions $\theta_b$ and $\theta_f$ which yield extra relativistic degrees of freedom parametrised by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Given that the number of efoldings of inflation $N$ depends on $T_{\rm rh}$, $\gamma$ determines both $N$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ as \cite{Cicoli:2018cgu}:
\begin{equation}
N =  52+\frac13 \ln\gamma 
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{0.6}{\gamma^2}\,, 
\label{NeffPred}
\end{equation}
where the best fit for Planck data alone is $7.41<\gamma\lesssim 20$ (which implies $N\simeq 52$) and $N_{\rm eff}=3.062^{+0.004}_{-0.015}$ at $68\%$ CL \cite{Cicoli:2020bao}. It is straightforward to check that all these observational constraints, combined with the requirement of having an effective field theory under control, can be satisfied for rather natural choices of the underlying parameters $W_0$, $A$, $B$ and $C$, together with $0.065\lesssim g_s\lesssim 0.125$ and $2500\lesssim {V} \lesssim 9000$.


\subsection{Unstable isocurvature modes?}

The fields ${V}$, $\tau_s$ and $\theta_s$ are heavier than the inflaton during inflation, and so remain fixed at their minima. On the other hand, the two ultra-light axions $\theta_b$ and $\theta_f$ source isocurvature perturbations. These axionic fields are kinetically coupled to the inflaton since the Lagrangian contains terms of the form \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr}:
\begin{equation}
{L}\supset \frac12 h^2(\phi)\,\partial_\mu \theta_b\partial^\mu \theta_b + \frac12  f^2(\phi)\,\partial_\mu \theta_f \partial^\mu \theta_f\,,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
h(\phi) = \frac{\alpha\sqrt{c}}{{V}^{2/3}}\,e^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\phi}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
f(\phi) = \frac{e^{-\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi}}{\sqrt{2} c {V}^{2/3}}\,,
\label{KinCoupl}
\end{equation}
with $c = g_s^{4/3} \lambda$. These kinetic couplings correspond to a curved field space which induces a tachyonic entropy perturbation $\delta s$ associated to $\theta_f$ \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr}, as we now briefly review. The entropy perturbation variable $\delta s$ has been introduced in \cite{Gordon:2000hv} and corresponds to perturbations orthogonal to the background inflationary trajectory. Considering the 2D ($\phi,\theta_f$) subspace obtained by keeping the axion $\theta_b$ fixed at its minimum, $\delta s$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\delta s = N_\phi\, \delta\phi + N_f\, \delta\theta_f\,,
\end{equation}
where $N_\phi$ and $N_f$ are the components of the normal unit vector $\vec{N}$ given by \cite{Achucarro:2010da,Cremonini:2010sv}:
\begin{equation}
\vec{N} = \left(\begin{matrix}
           N_\phi \\
           N_f \\
           \end{matrix}\right)
           = \frac{f}{\sqrt{\dot\phi^2 + (f \dot\theta_f)^2}}\left(\begin{matrix}
           - \dot\theta_f \\
           \dot\phi \\
           \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
When $\theta_b$ is massless, the effective mass-squared of $\delta s$ evaluated on the background attractor trajectory receives contributions from the metric connection and the Ricci scalar of the field manifold $R=-8/3$ which give \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk}:
\begin{equation}
m_{\delta s}^2\simeq -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\left( \partial_\phi V_{\rm inf} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\,\dot{\phi}^2\right)<0 \,.
\label{eq:meffULF}
\end{equation}
This mass is clearly tachyonic since $\partial_\phi V_{\rm inf}>0$. Notice that the isocurvature perturbation associated to $\theta_b$ would have instead a positive mass-squared due to the different sign in the exponent of the corresponding kinetic coupling, as can be seen from (\ref{KinCoupl}). The geometrical instability associated to $\theta_f$ might seem very dangerous since it induces an exponential growth of isocurvature modes that could bring the system away from the perturbative approximation, as can be seen from Fig. \ref{Fig1}. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{PRS_FI_thetaf_new.pdf}

While $\theta_b$ entropy modes decay, the isocurvature perturbations associated to $\theta_f$ experience an exponential growth.}
\label{Fig1}
\end{figure}

This consideration appears however to be in contradiction with the analysis of \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr} which showed that, regardless of the choice of initial conditions, the system quickly approaches a single field dynamics where the inflationary trajectory has a vanishing turning rate and the ultra-light axions are frozen with zero velocity. In Sec. \ref{NoInst} we shall shed light on this paradox, arguing that in this case $\delta s$ is an ill-defined variable since the exponential growth is hidden in the $N_f$ component of the normal vector.

Before showing that FI models are stable, let us stress that $m_{\delta s}$ would be tachyonic also when considering a massive $\theta_f$ axion. The scalar potential for $\theta_f$ is generated by non-perturbative effects and looks like:
\begin{equation} 
V_f (\phi,\theta_f)= \Lambda \,e^{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi} e^{-k\, e^{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi}}\cos{\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\theta_f\right)}\,,
\label{Vf}
\end{equation}
where (setting the prefactor of non-perturbative effects to unity):
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \frac{8\pi c W_0}{n {V}^{4/3}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad k = \frac{2\pi c}{n}\, {V}^{2/3}\,.
\end{equation}
The total potential now becomes:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{\rm inf}(\phi) + V_f (\phi, \theta_f)\,,
\end{equation}
where $V_{\rm inf}$ is given by (\ref{Vinf}) and we need to require $V_f (\phi,\theta_f)\ll V_{\rm inf}(\phi)$ to prevent any modification of the FI dynamics. Due to the double exponential suppression in (\ref{Vf}), this condition implies that $V_f$ can make $m_{\delta s}^2$ positive only locally in field space but not throughout the whole trans-Planckian inflaton range, $\Delta\phi\simeq {O}(5)$. In fact, \cite{Cicoli:2019ulk} has shown that $m_{\delta s}^2<0$ for any choice of the microscopic parameters which keeps $V_f (\phi,\theta_f)\ll V_{\rm inf}(\phi)$ for the whole inflationary epoch. Fig. \ref{Fig2} shows how the hierarchy between $V_f (\phi,\theta_f)$ and $ V_{\rm inf}(\phi)$ varies as a function of $\Lambda$ and $n$.

The vertical line denotes the maximum inflaton value compatible with a controlled effective field theory which we choose to be $\tau_b>\tau_{b,{\rm min}} = 1$ corresponding to $\phi <\phi_{\rm max} = \sqrt{3} \ln\langle\tau_b\rangle \simeq 10.8$.

\section{Stability of Fibre Inflation and decaying isocurvature modes}
\label{NoInst}

\subsection{Physical entropy variable}

The quantity constrained by Planck observations is the primordial isocurvature fraction $\beta_{\rm iso} = {P}_{{S}_{i\gamma}}/ [{P}_{{R}} + {P}_{{S}_{i\gamma}}]$, where ${P}_{{R}}$ is the curvature power spectrum while ${S}_{i\gamma}$ is the relative entropy perturbation between photons and a different $i$-th species (cold dark matter, baryons or neutrinos), with $\beta_{\rm iso}<{O}(0.1-0.01)$ depending on the species involved \cite{Akrami:2018odb}. Thus in order to compare the predictions of FI models with observations, one would need to focus on the super-horizon evolution of the relative entropy perturbation between $\phi$ and $\theta_f$ defined as \cite{Malik:2004tf}:
\begin{equation} 
{S}_{\phi \theta_f}= -3 H \left(\frac{\delta\rho_\phi}{\dot\rho_\phi}-\frac{\delta\rho_{\theta_f}}{\dot\rho_{\theta_f}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_i$ are the energy densities of the two fields. Thanks to the detailed analysis of reheating performed in \cite{Cicoli:2018cgu}, one should then derive ${S}_{i\gamma}$ from ${S}_{\phi \theta_f}$. However, as pointed out in \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb} (see also \cite{Wands:2000dp}), in FI models ${S}_{\phi \theta_f}$ is an ill-defined quantity (despite being gauge invariant even for a curved field space) since $\dot\rho_{\theta_f}\to 0$ given that the energy density of the ultra-light axions vanishes. Thus, similarly to $\delta s$, also ${S}_{\phi \theta_f}$ would yield an unphysical divergence of isocurvature perturbations.

As explained in \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb}, the correct physical, i.e. both gauge invariant and finite, entropy variable which should be used in this case is the relative entropy perturbation ${S}_{\rm rel}$ which can be defined starting from the notion of total entropy perturbation ${S}$:
\begin{equation}
{S}=\frac{H}{\dot{P}}\,\delta P_{\rm nad}\,,
\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}
where $\delta P_{\rm nad}$ is the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation which can be obtained from the total pressure perturbation $\delta P$ as $\delta P_{\rm nad}=\delta P-c_s^2 \delta\rho$ with $c_s^2=\dot P/\dot \rho$. 

The relative entropy perturbation ${S}_{\rm rel}$ is then obtained by subtracting the intrinsic entropy perturbation ${S}_{\rm int}$ from the total one, ${S}_{\rm rel}= {S}-{S}_{\rm int}$, where ${S}_{\rm int}$ is given by the sum of the entropies associated to each fluid ${S}_{{\rm int},i}$ \cite{Malik:2004tf}:
\begin{equation}
{S}_{\rm int}=\sum_i {S}_{{\rm int},i}=\sum_i\frac{H}{\dot{P}}\left(\delta P_i - c_i^2 \delta \rho_i\right),
\label{eq:Sint}
\end{equation}
with $c_i^2=\dot P_i/\dot\rho_i$ denoting the sound speed of each scalar cosmological fluid. Using $\delta P = \sum_i \delta P_i$ and $\delta \rho = \sum_i \delta \rho_i$, the relative entropy perturbation hence becomes (focusing on the FI case with two fields, $\phi$ and $\theta_f$):
\begin{equation}
{S}_{\rm rel} = \frac{\left(c_{\theta_f}^2-c_\phi^2\right)}{3\dot\rho\dot P}\, \dot\rho_\phi \dot\rho_{\theta_f}  {S}_{\phi \theta_f}\,.
\label{Srel}
\end{equation}
This quantity is now well-behaved since its denominator is independent on the vanishing quantity $\dot\rho_{\theta_f}$. The prescription of \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb} is to study the evolution of ${S}_{\rm rel}$ from inflation to radiation dominance after reheating, and then to infer from (\ref{Srel}) ${S}_{i\gamma}$ and the final prediction for $\beta_{\rm iso}$. 

\subsection{Decaying isocurvature perturbations}

We shall now focus on FI models and show that the power spectrum of isocurvature modes associated to ${S}_{\rm rel}$ decays on super-horizon scales during inflation. We start by rewriting (\ref{Srel}) in a form which is easier to evaluate analytically: 
\begin{equation}
{S}_{\rm rel}=\frac{H}{\dot P} \left[\left( c_\phi^2-c_s^2\right)\delta\rho_\phi+\left( c_{\theta_f}^2-c_s^2\right)\delta\rho_{\theta_f}\right]\,.
\label{Srelnew}
\end{equation}
The energy and pressure of the two fields can be written as: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_\phi&=&\frac12 \dot\phi^2+V_{\rm inf}\,,\qquad \rho_{\theta_f}=\frac12 (f\dot\theta_f)^2+V_f\,, \nonumber \\
P_\phi&=&\frac12 \dot\phi^2-V_{\rm inf}\,,\qquad P_{\theta_f}=\frac12 (f\dot\theta_f)^2-V_f\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where this split does not have a clear physical meaning since $V_f(\phi,\theta_f)$. It is however useful to evaluate ${S}_{\rm rel}$ and to reduce to a single field dynamics since we will see that for $V_f(\phi,\theta_f)\ll V_{\rm inf}(\phi)$ the system very quickly approaches an attractor background trajectory characterised by $(f\dot\theta_f)\to 0$ and $\rho_{\theta_f}\to 0$.

The total sound speed of the system is given by:
\begin{equation}
c_s^2=1+\frac{2}{3H}\frac{\dot\phi\,\partial_\phi V_{\rm tot}  + \dot\theta_f\,\partial_{\theta_f} V_f }{\dot\phi^2 +(f\dot\theta_f)^2}\,,
\end{equation}
while the sound speeds of the fluid components are:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_\phi^2&=&1+\frac{2\,\partial_\phi V_{\rm inf}}{3H\dot\phi-f \partial_\phi f\, \dot\theta_f^2 + \partial_\phi V_f}\,, \nonumber \\
c_{\theta_f}^2&=&1+\frac{2\left( \partial_{\theta_f} V_f \dot\theta_f+ \partial_\phi V_f\dot\phi\right)}{\dot\theta_f^2 \left( 3H f^2+ f \partial_\phi f \dot\phi -\partial_\phi V_f \dot\phi\dot\theta_f^{-2}\right)}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we used the equations of motion given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot\phi &=& -3H\dot\phi +f\partial_\phi f \dot\theta_f^2-\partial_\phi V_{\rm tot}\,,  \\
f^2\ddot\theta_f &=& -3H f^2\dot\theta_f-2 f\partial_\phi f \dot\phi\dot\theta_f-\partial_{\theta_f} V_f\,.
\label{eq2}
\end{eqnarray}
To compute the energy density fluctuations, we use perturbation theory at linear order in the spatially flat gauge (since ${S}_{\rm rel}$ is gauge invariant), obtaining:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta\rho_\phi&=&-\Phi \dot\phi^2 + \dot\phi \delta\dot\phi  +\partial_\phi V_{\rm inf} \delta\phi\,,  \\
\delta\rho_{\theta_f}&=& (f \dot\theta_f)^2 \left(\frac{\partial_\phi f}{f}\delta\phi +\frac{\delta\dot\theta_f}{\dot\theta_f}-\Phi \right)+ \partial_\phi V_f \delta\phi+\partial_{\theta_f} V_f \delta\theta_f \,, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where the lapse function $\Phi$ reads:
\begin{equation} 
\Phi=\frac{1}{2H}\left(\dot\phi \delta\phi + f^2  \dot\theta_f \delta\theta_f\right)\,.
\end{equation}
In order to obtain simple analytic results, we now consider the case with $V_f=0$ which gives a very good approximation of the generic behaviour of the system since $V_f\ll V_{\rm inf}$ (we have however performed a numerical analysis also for $V_f\neq 0$ whose results we present below). 

The quantities derived above have to be evaluated on the inflationary trajectory. As derived in \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr}, the equation of motion (\ref{eq2}) admits a slow-roll solution which looks like (prime denotes a derivative with respect to $N$):
\begin{equation}
(f\theta_f')\simeq (f\theta_f')(0)\,e^{-3N} \to 0\,, 
\end{equation}
which implies that during inflation the ultra-light axion $\theta_f$ very quickly gets frozen. It is easy to realise that in this limit $(c_\phi^2 - c_s^2)\to 0$ and $\delta\rho_{\theta_f}\to 0$, while both $(c_{\theta_f}^2-c_s^2)$ and $\delta\rho_\phi$ remain finite (in particular $c_{\theta_f}^2\to 1$). Moreover $H/\dot P\to -1/\left(6\epsilon H^2 + 2 \partial_\phi V \sqrt{2\epsilon} \right)$ , and so also this ratio is finite. Thus both terms in (\ref{Srelnew}) vanish and ${S}_{\rm rel}\to 0$ in the attractor inflationary trajectory.

Isocurvature modes associated to the relative entropy perturbation ${S}_{\rm rel}$ are therefore negligible in FI models. The geometrical destabilisation found in \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr} and reviewed in Sec. \ref{FibreReview} is thus a spurious effect due to the use of an ill-defined entropy variable. We conclude that the dynamics of FI models is stable and essentially single-field, begin characterised by decaying isocurvature modes which give rise to a negligibly small $\beta_{\rm iso}$ in full agreement with Planck data.

In both cases the only relevant contribution comes from the intrinsic entropy perturbation of the inflaton that coincides with the single field contribution ${S}_{\rm sf}$.}

We have confirmed this analytic result via a numerical analysis (including non-zero axionic potentials) whose results are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:entropy} which shows the super-horizon evolution of different power spectra associated to ${S}$, ${S}_{\rm int}$ and ${S}_{\rm rel}$ given respectively by (\ref{eq:S}), (\ref{eq:Sint}) and (\ref{Srel}). Clearly the contribution coming from the relative entropy perturbation is strongly subdominant for both ultra-light axions. The total entropy perturbation is instead just given by the intrinsic contribution coming from the inflaton that coincides with the single field result. 











\section{Conclusions}
\label{Conclusions}

It is fair to say that FI represents one of the best approaches to derive inflation from string theory from both the theoretical and the observational point of view since this class of constructions features controlled moduli stabilisation with an effective approximate shift symmetry, explicit Calabi-Yau embeddings with D-branes, O-planes and chiral matter, and an inflationary potential of Starobinsky-like type which gives so far the best fit to Planck data.

However FI models have been claimed to be plagued by a dangerous geometrical destabilisation effect due to the curvature of the underlying field space \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr}. Starting from the general discussion of entropy perturbation variables performed in \cite{Cicoli:2021yhb}, in this paper we have argued that FI models are actually free from any geometrical destabilisation and the inflationary dynamics is essentially single-field with a negligible production of isocurvature fluctuations. In fact, we have shown that the exponential growth of isocurvature modes associated to perturbations orthogonal to the background trajectory noticed in \cite{Cicoli:2018ccr} is just an unphysical artifact due to the use of an entropy variable which in this case becomes ill-defined due to the anomalous behaviour of the normal unit vector. When studying the evolution during inflation of isocurvature modes associated to the correct physical quantity, the relative entropy perturbation ${S}_{\rm rel}$, we found instead that the corresponding power spectrum decays on super-horizon scales.

We believe that this results holds not just for FI models but more in general also for any inflationary model where the inflaton is kinetically coupled to ultra-light axion-like fields, a situation which can emerge rather naturally in supergravity and string theory effective setups.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Cosmic inflation is an early period of accelerated expansion of our universe which can provide a solution to the flatness and horizon problems of standard Big Bang cosmology. Moreover, quantum fluctuations during inflation can source primordial perturbations that caused the formation of large scale structures and the temperatures anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background.

From a microscopic point of view, inflation is expected to be driven by the dynamics of a scalar field undergoing a slow-roll motion along a very shallow potential that mimics a positive cosmological constant. An important feature of inflationary models is the distance travelled by the inflaton in field space during inflation since it is proportional to the amount of primordial gravitational waves which get produced \cite{Lyth:1996im}. From an effective field theory point of view, in small field models with a sub-Planckian inflaton excursion, dimension six operators can easily spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential. On the other hand, quantum corrections to large field models with a trans-Planckian field range lead to an infinite series of unsuppressed higher-dimensional operators which seem to bring the effective field theory approach out of control.

These dangerous operators can be argued to be absent or very suppressed only in the presence of a symmetry whose origin can only be postulated from an effective field theory perspective but can instead be derived from an underlying UV complete theory. For this reason inflationary model building in string theory has received a lot of attention \cite{McAllister:2007bg, Baumann:2009ni, Cicoli:2011zz, Burgess:2013sla}. Besides the presence of additional symmetries, string compactifications naturally provide many 4D scalars which can play the r\^ole of the inflaton. Promising inflaton candidates are type IIB K\"ahler moduli which parametrise the size of the extra dimensions and enjoy non-compact rescaling symmetries inherited from the underlying no-scale structure \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. 

Identifying a natural inflaton candidate with an appropriate symmetry that protects the flatness of its potential against quantum corrections is however not sufficient to trust inflationary model building in string compactifications. In fact, three additional requirements to have a successful string inflationary model are ($i$) full moduli stabilisation, ($ii$) a global embedding into consistent Calabi-Yau orientifolds with D-branes and fluxes and ($iii$) the realisation of a chiral visible sector. 

The first condition is crucial to determine all the energy scales in the model and to check the stability of the inflationary dynamics by controlling the behaviour of the scalar directions orthogonal to the inflaton one. The second condition is instead fundamental to guarantee the consistency of the inflation model from the microscopic point of view by checking the cancellation of all D-brane tadpoles and Freed-Witten anomalies and the actual generation of all the effects needed to stabilise the moduli and to develop the inflationary potential. Finally the requirement of having a model which can give rise to inflation and reproduce at the same time a chiral visible sector is crucial for two main reasons: to ensure the absence of any dangerous interplay between chirality and moduli stabilisation which can forbid the generation of D-terms or non-perturbative effects needed to fix the moduli \cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm}, and to determine the post-inflationary evolution of our universe starting from the reheating process where the inflaton energy density gets converted into the production of visible sector degrees of freedom \cite{Green:2007gs, Brandenberger:2008kn, Barnaby:2009wr, Cicoli:2010ha}. Other important post-inflationary issues which can affect the predictions of important inflationary observables like the number of efoldings $N_e$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are periods of matter domination due to light moduli \cite{Dutta:2014tya, Cicoli:2016olq, Bhattacharya:2017ysa}, the production of axionic dark radiation from moduli decays \cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Hebecker:2014gka, Cicoli:2015bpq}, non-thermal dark matter \cite{Acharya:2008bk, Allahverdi:2013noa, Aparicio:2015sda}, moduli-induced baryogenesis \cite{Kane:2011ih, Allahverdi:2016yws} and the interplay between the inflationary and the supersymmetry breaking scale \cite{Conlon:2008cj, He:2010uk, Antusch:2011wu, Buchmuller:2014pla}.

A comprehensive global chiral model which satisfies all these conditions for models where the inflaton is a local blow-up mode \cite{Conlon:2005jm} has been recently constructed in \cite{Cicoli:2017shd}. The chiral visible sector lives on D3-branes at an orientifolded singularity and full closed string moduli stabilisation in a dS vacuum is achieved by following the LVS procedure \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Cicoli:2008va}. The main limitation of this model is the emergence of an $\eta$-problem associated with the presence of large $g_s$ corrections to the effective action which tend to spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential if their flux-dependent coefficients are not tuned small. 

In this regard, fibre inflation models \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} look more promising. In these constructions, the inflaton is a fibration modulus which remains exactly massless when only the leading order no-scale breaking effects are included. The inflationary potential is then generated only at subleading order by a combination of string loop corrections \cite{Berg:2005ja, Berg:2007wt, Berg:2014ama, Haack:2015pbv} and higher derivative terms \cite{Ciupke:2015msa, Grimm:2017okk}. This hierarchy of scales is guaranteed by the extended no-scale cancellation and provides a natural solution to the $\eta$-problem \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. This solution can also be understood from the point of view of an effective non-compact rescaling symmetry for the K\"ahler moduli \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. 

Different versions of fibre inflation models have been constructed so far depending on the microscopic nature of the effects which drive the inflationary dynamics: Kaluza-Klein and winding string loops \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, Kaluza-Klein loops and ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ $F^4$ terms \cite{Broy:2015zba}, and winding $g_s$ loops combined with higher derivative terms \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. In all cases the inflationary potential is plateau-like and takes a simple form with a constant term and negative exponentials. Additional positive exponentials show up with coefficients which are naturally very small and give rise to a rising behaviour at large field values. Ref. \cite{Burgess:2016owb} provided a generalised description of fibre inflation models showing how they can reproduce the correct spectral index observed by Planck \cite{Ade:2015lrj, Ade:2015xua} while the predicted value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio is in the range $0.001 \lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$. Such a large value of $r$ is compatible with the fact that these are large field models where the inflaton range is around $5$ Planck units. An effective supergravity description of fibre inflation models as $\alpha$-attractors has also been recently given in \cite{Kallosh:2017wku}. 

Despite all these successes, fibre inflation models are still lacking a complete global embedding into chiral string compactifications. However a first step forward has already been made in \cite{Cicoli:2016xae} where these inflationary models have been successfully embedded in consistent type IIB orientifolds with moduli stabilisation but without a chiral visible sector. In order to have a viable inflationary and moduli stabilisation mechanism, the internal Calabi-Yau manifold has to have at least $h^{1,1}=3$ K\"ahler moduli and its volume form has to feature a K3 or $T^4$ fibration over a ${P}^1$ base and a rigid  shrinkable blow-up mode \cite{Cicoli:2008va, Cicoli:2011it}. Starting from concrete Calabi-Yau threefolds with these topological properties, ref. \cite{Cicoli:2016xae} provided several different examples with an explicit choice of orientifold involution and D3/D7 brane setups which are globally consistent and can generate corrections to the 4D effective action that can fix all closed string moduli inside the K\"ahler cone and reproduce the form of the inflationary potential of fibre inflation models. However the case with $h^{1,1}=3$ is too simple to allow for non-trivial D7 worldvolume fluxes which give rise to chiral matter. In fact, non-zero gauge fluxes induce moduli dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos terms which, in combination with soft term contributions for $U(1)$-charged matter fields, would lift the leading order flat direction, making the inflaton too heavy to drive inflation. 

In this paper we shall extend the results of \cite{Cicoli:2016xae} by considering more complicated Calabi-Yau threefolds with $h^{1,1}=4$ in order to build global fibre inflation models with a chiral visible sector. After analysing the topological conditions on the underlying compactification manifold to allow a successful chiral global embedding of fibre inflation models, we find that the simplest examples involve Calabi-Yau threefolds with $3$ K3 divisors and a toroidal-like volume with a diagonal del Pezzo divisor suitable to support non-perturbative effects to freeze the moduli. The internal volume is therefore controlled by $3$ K\"ahler moduli and can equivalently be seen as different K3 fibrations over $3$ different ${P}^1$ bases. After searching through the Kreuzer-Skarke list of Calabi-Yau manifolds embedded in toric varieties \cite{Kreuzer:2000xy}, we find several concrete examples which admit these topological features. 

We then focus on one of them and describe several possible choices of orientifold involution, D-brane setup and gauge fluxes which satisfy global consistency conditions and generate perturbative $g_s$ and $\alpha'$ corrections to the 4D K\"ahler potential and non-perturbative effects in the superpotential that are suitable to both stabilise the moduli and reproduce the typical potential of fibre inflation models. In particular, non-zero gauge fluxes induce chiral matter on D7-branes wrapped around smooth combinations of the four-cycles which control the overall volume.\footnote{We do not consider K3 fibred cases where the visible sector lives on D3 branes at singularities since they would lead to dark radiation overproduction \cite{Angus:2014bia}.} Moreover, a moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term lifts one of the K\"ahler moduli, so that after D-term stabilisation the effective number of K\"ahler moduli is reduced to $3$ and the internal volume simplifies to the standard expression of fibre inflation models used in the examples of \cite{Cicoli:2016xae}.

After computing all relevant loop and higher derivative effects in full detail, we analyse the resulting inflationary dynamics finding an interesting result: the K\"ahler cone bounds set severe constraints on the allowed inflaton field range when they are combined with other phenomenological requirements, like the generation of the correct amplitude of the power spectrum by the inflaton quantum fluctuations, and consistency conditions like the stability of the inflaton evolution against possible orthogonal runaway directions, the fact that the gravitino mass remains always smaller than any Kaluza-Klein scale in the model and finally that dangerous higher derivative effects do not spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential before achieving enough efoldings of inflation.\footnote{These last two consistency conditions are qualitatively similar since the superspace derivative expansion is under control if $m_{3/2}\ll M_\KK$ \cite{Cicoli:2013swa}.} Because of this tension, we also perform a full multi-field numerical analysis of the inflationary evolution showing how an early period of accelerated expansion occurs generically. On the other hand, the inflaton quantum fluctuations can generate the right amplitude of the density perturbations only if the microscopic parameters take appropriate values. 

We believe that our results make fibre inflation models more robust since they represent the first concrete models which are globally consistent and chiral. Nonetheless several issues still need to be investigated further. The most important ones are the inclusion of an explicit uplifting mechanism to realise a dS vacuum, a thorough derivation of the perturbative corrections to the 4D effective action and a better determination of the Calabi-Yau K\"ahler cone, going beyond its approximated expression inherited from the toric ambient space. We leave the study of these issues for the future. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{MinReq}, after presenting a basic review of fibre inflation models, we summarise the minimal requirements that are needed for the construction of a fully consistent global embedding with a chiral visible sector. In Sec. \ref{ExA} we provide a concrete Calabi-Yau example, describing the orientifold involution, the D-brane setup, the choice of gauge fluxes and the resulting chiral spectrum, Fayet-Iliopoulos term and inflationary potential generated by $g_s$ and $\alpha'$ effects. The inflationary evolution is analysed in full detail in Sec. \ref{InfAn} by focusing first on the single-field approximation and by studying then the multi-field dynamics. In Sec. \ref{Concl} we draw our conclusions and we discuss a few open issues. App. \ref{ExB} contains additional explicit chiral global examples.

\section{Chiral global inflationary models}
\label{MinReq}

Let us begin by briefly reviewing the setup of fibre inflation and proceed afterward by displaying the minimal requirements for a successful chiral global embedding of fibre inflation models.

\subsection{Fibre inflation in a nutshell}

Fibre inflation models are based on a class of type IIB orientifold flux compactifications with D3/D7-branes and O3/O7-planes where the Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold takes a so-called `weak Swiss-cheese' form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = f_{3/2}(\tau_j)  - \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm small}} \lambda_i \tau_i^{3/2} \quad\text{with}\quad j=1,...,N_{\rm large}\,,
\label{voGen}
\end{equation}
where $h^{1,1} = N_{\rm large} + N_{\rm small}$ and $f_{3/2}$ is a homogeneous function of degree $3/2$. In these models, the stabilisation of the K\"ahler moduli is performed in two steps. Firstly, the total volume ${V}$ as well as the volumes of the $N_{\rm small}$ rigid blow-up divisors $\tau_i$ are fixed following the LVS procedure \cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx, Cicoli:2008va} where the leading order $\alpha'^3$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Becker:2002nn, Minasian:2015bxa, Bonetti:2016dqh} are balanced against non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential \cite{Kachru:2003aw}. This leaves $N_{\rm flat} = N_{\rm large} -1 = h^{1,1} - N_{\rm small} - 1$ flat directions which are natural inflaton candidates. These directions can receive a potential at subleading order by $g_s$ corrections due to the exchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK) and winding modes \cite{Berg:2005ja, Berg:2007wt, Berg:2014ama, Haack:2015pbv, Cicoli:2007xp} as well as by $(\alpha')^3$ $F^4$-terms \cite{Ciupke:2015msa, Grimm:2017okk}. In the simplest fibre inflation models $h^{1,1}=3$ and $N_{\rm small}=1$, so that $N_{\rm flat}=1$. This leading order flat direction corresponds to a K\"ahler modulus $\tau_f$ which parametrises the volume of a K3 surface and the total scalar potential schematically looks like \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Broy:2015zba, Cicoli:2016chb, Burgess:2016owb}:
\begin{equation}
V = V_\LVS ({V} ,\tau_s ) + V_\dS ({V}) + V_{\rm inf} ({V} ,\tau_s, \tau_f)\,,
\end{equation}
where $V_{\rm inf} ({V} ,\tau_s, \tau_f) = V_{g_s}^\KK + V_{g_s}^\W + V_{F^4} \ll V_\LVS ({V} ,\tau_i )$ is the inflationary potential. $V_\LVS$ is the leading order LVS potential which fixes ${V}$ and $\tau_s$, $V_\dS$ is an uplifting contribution to get a dS vacuum which can originate from anti D3-branes \cite{Kachru:2003aw, antiDdS}, hidden sector T-branes \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx} or non-perturbative effects at singularities \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}, while $V_{g_s}^\KK$, $V_{g_s}^\W$ and $V_{F^4}$ are respectively KK and winding string loops and $F^4$ terms. 

In fibre inflation models, the underlying CY threefold is a K3 fibration over a ${P}^1$ base which has two decompactification limits, corresponding to either the K3 fibre or the base growing large. Thus, kinematically it is expected that the fibre volume can traverse several Planck units. These LVS inflationary models present a variety of distinct features that make them very promising candidates to realise large field inflation and to discuss explicit global embeddings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The de Sitter uplift is independent of the inflaton. This is contrary to a hypothetical KKLT embedding \cite{Kachru:2003aw}, where the uplift would be inflaton-dependent and, thus, large field inflation would typically destroy the KKLT minimum.

\item The back-reaction of heavy moduli is incorporated and under control, in particular, due to the fact that moduli stabilisation is done in two steps and the leading order potential is independent of the inflaton because of the extended no-scale cancellation \cite{Cicoli:2007xp}. This is in contrast with the majority of large field models of inflation \cite{Westphal:2015eva}.

\item The possibility to achieve tensor-to-scalar ratios between $r \sim 0.01$ and $r \sim 0.001$ which can be tested by future CMB observations \cite{Remazeilles:2015hpa, Remazeilles:2017zlb}.
\end{enumerate}
An explicit realisation of fibre inflation not only places several constraints on the underlying CY geometry, but also on the setup of D-branes and O-planes. In the following section we list the sufficient requirements to build a viable global model which also allows for a chiral visible sector.

\subsection{Requirements for chiral global embedding}

The simplest global embedding of fibre inflation models requires at least three K\"ahler moduli \cite{Cicoli:2016xae}. However, in order to incorporate also a chiral visible sector we need at least $h^{1,1}=4$ K\"ahler moduli. Here we will focus on obtaining chiral matter on D7-branes wrapped around a suitable divisor with world-volume gauge fluxes turned on. In this case D7 gauge fluxes induce a D-term potential for the K\"ahler moduli that fixes a particular combination thereof. Thus, D-term fixing and the leading order LVS stabilisation mechanism leave just a single flat direction, in our case a K3 fibre, which will play the r\^ole of the inflaton. In order to obtain a viable chiral global model we require the following ingredients and consistency conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Calabi-Yau with $h^{1,1}=4$ featuring three large cycles and a shrinkable rigid divisor, so that the internal volume takes the form (\ref{voGen}) with $N_{\rm small}=1$. In the explicit example described in Sec. \ref{ExA} the volume simplifies further to: 
\begin{equation}
{V}=c_a\,\sqrt{\tau_1\,\tau_2\,\tau_3}-c_b\,\tau_s^{3/2}\,,
\label{VoLu}
\end{equation}
with $c_a>0$ and $c_b>0$. Each of the $3$ moduli $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ controls the volume of a K3 surface while $\tau_s$ parametrises the size of a `diagonal' del Pezzo divisor \cite{Cicoli:2011it}. D-term stabilisation will fix $\tau_3\propto \tau_2$ while the standard LVS procedure will freeze the overall volume ${V}\simeq c_a\,\sqrt{\tau_1\,\tau_2\,\tau_3}$ and the blow-up mode $\tau_s$. The leading order flat direction can be parametrised by $\tau_1$ which will drive inflation. 

\item An orientifold involution and a D3/D7-brane setup with gauge fluxes on the visible D7-brane stacks such that tadpole cancellation is satisfied with enough room for bulk three-form fluxes to be turned on for complex structure and dilaton stabilisation. The D-brane and O-plane setup must also allow for the generation of KK- and/or winding string loop corrections which have the correct form to generate a suitable inflationary potential.

\item A choice of world-volume fluxes which cancels all Freed-Witten anomalies \cite{Minasian:1997mm, Freed:1999vc} but leads, at the same time, to just a single moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term \cite{Dine:1987xk, Dine:1987gj} in order to leave a leading order inflationary flat direction by lifting just one of the two flat directions leftover by the LVS stabilisation mechanism. 

\item There should be no chiral intersection between the visible sector and the del Pezzo divisor supporting non-perturbative effects required for LVS moduli fixing as otherwise the prefactor of the non-perturbative superpotential would be vanishing \cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm}. The absence of these dangerous chiral intersections should be guaranteed by an appropriate choice of gauge fluxes. 

\item Moduli stabilisation and inflation have to take place inside the CY K\"ahler cone and the effective field theory should be well under control with $\langle {V} \rangle \gg 1$ and $g_s \ll 1$. 

\item In order to trust inflationary model building within an effective field theory, the following hierarchy of scales should be satisfied from horizon exit to the end of inflation:
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm inf} < H < m_{3/2} < M_\KK^{(i)} < M_s < M_p \,,
\end{equation} 
where $m_{\rm inf}$ is the inflaton mass, $H$ is the Hubble constant, $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass which sets the mass scale of all the heavy moduli during inflation, $M_\KK^{(i)}$ denote various KK scales associated with bulk modes and open string excitations on D7-branes wrapped around four-cycles, $M_s$ is the string scale and $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass $M_p = 2.4\cdot 10^{18}$ GeV. Notice that, apart from $M_p$, all these energy scales are moduli dependent and so evolve during inflation. After stabilising ${V}$ and $\tau_s$ $\grave{a}$ la LVS and fixing one large modulus in terms of another large direction via setting the FI-term to zero, we find that the `reduced' moduli space of the inflationary direction is in fact a compact interval. Therefore the field space available for inflation is kinematically finite (albeit in general trans-Planckian), a feature of the model which has so far been overlooked. We will state the precise phenomenological and consistency conditions for successful inflation in Sec. \ref{InfAn}.
\end{enumerate}





\section{A chiral global example}
\label{ExA}

In this section, we shall present all the topological and model-building details of the global embedding of fibre inflation models into explicit chiral CY orientifolds with $h^{1,1} = 4$.

\subsection{Toric data}

Let us consider the following toric data for a CY threefold whose volume takes the form ${V}=c_a\,\sqrt{\tau_1\,\tau_2\,\tau_3}-c_b\,\tau_s^{3/2}$ discussed above: 
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c||cccccccc|}
\hline
     & $x_1$  & $x_2$  & $x_3$  & $x_4$  & $x_5$ & $x_6$  & $x_7$ & $x_8$   \\
    \hline
 4 & 0 & 0  & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0  & 2   \\
 4 & 0 & 0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  & 2   \\
 4 & 0 & 1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 2   \\   
 8 & 1 & 0  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1  & 4   \\   
 \hline
 & dP$_7$ & NdP$_{11}$  &  NdP$_{11}$ & K3 & NdP$_{11}$ & K3 & K3 & SD \\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}
The Hodge numbers are $(h^{2,1}, h^{1,1}) = (98, 4)$, the Euler number is $\chi=-188$, while the Stanley-Reisner ideal is:
\begin{equation}
{\rm SR1} =  \{ x_1 x_4, \, x_1 x_6,\, x_1 x_7, \, x_2 x_7, \, x_3 x_6, \, x_4 x_5 x_8, \, x_2 x_3 x_5 x_8 \}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the polytope ID $\#1206$ in the CY database of Ref. \cite{Altman:2014bfa}. A detailed divisor analysis using \texttt{cohomCalg} \cite{Blumenhagen:2010pv, Blumenhagen:2011xn} shows that the divisor $D_1$ is a del Pezzo dP$_7$ while each of the divisors $\{D_4, \, D_6,\, D_7 \}$ is a K3 surface. Moreover, each of the divisors $\{D_2, \, D_3,\, D_5 \}$ is a `rigid but not del Pezzo' surface with $h^{1,1} =12$ which we denote as NdP$_{11}$ while $D_8$ is a `special deformation' divisors with Hodge diamond:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm SD} \equiv
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  23 & & 160 & & 23 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \nonumber\\
	\end{eqnarray}
The intersection form in the basis of smooth divisors $\{D_1, D_4, D_6, D_7\}$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
I_3= 2 \, D_4 \, D_6 \, D_7 + 2 \, D_1^3 \,.
\label{I3A}
\end{equation}
Writing the K\"ahler form in the above basis of divisors as $J=t_1\, D_1 + t_4\, D_4 + t_6 \, D_6+ t_7\, D_7$  and using the intersection
polynomial (\ref{I3A}), the CY overall volume becomes:
\begin{equation}
{V} = 2\, t_4\, t_6\, t_7 + \frac{t_1^3}{3}\,.
\label{VolA}
\end{equation}
The K\"ahler cone conditions can be derived from the following generators of the K\"ahler cone: 
\begin{equation}
K_1 = - \, D_1 + D_4 + D_6 + D_7\,, \qquad K_2 =  D_7\,, \qquad K_3 =  D_4\,, \qquad K_4 =  D_6\,.
\end{equation}
Expanding the K\"ahler form as $J= \sum_{i=1}^4 r_i K_i$, the K\"ahler cone is defined via the following conditions on the two-cycle moduli:
\begin{equation}
r_1 = -\, t_1 > 0\,, \qquad r_2 = t_1 + t_7 > 0\,, \qquad r_3 = t_1 + t_4 >0\,, \qquad r_4 = t_1 + t_6 > 0\,.
\label{KCCA}
\end{equation}
Notice that this expression of the CY K\"ahler cone is only approximate since it is inherited from the K\"ahler cone of the ambient toric variety.\footnote{If the same CY threefold can be realised as a hypersurface embedded in different ambient spaces, the CY K\"ahler cone is approximated as the intersection of the K\"ahler cones of the different toric varieties \cite{Altman:2014bfa}.} However this procedure can either overcount some curves of the CY threefold, for example if they do not intersect with the CY hypersurface, or miss some of them, if they cannot be obtained as the intersection between two divisors of the ambient space and the CY hypersurface. Hence the actual CY K\"ahler cone can turn out to be either larger or smaller. This analysis would require a deeper investigation which is however beyond the scope of this paper.\footnote{We however expect that the CY K\"ahler cone cannot get smaller. In fact, if this were the case, there should exist an extra constraint from requiring the positivity of a curve of the CY which is trivial in the ambient space. But this does not seem to be possible since each CY divisor is inherited from a single toric divisor (i.e. we do not have a toric divisor which splits into two CY divisors, and so where $h^{1,1}$ of the CY is larger than $h^{1,1}$ of the ambient space). In fact, if this trivial curve existed, it should have a dual divisors, and so $h^{1,1}$ of the CY should be larger than $h^{1,1}$ of the ambient case, which is however not the case.} Here we just mention that this analysis has been performed in detail in \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} where the CY K\"ahler cone turned out to be larger than the approximated version. 

The four-cycle moduli, which can be computed as $\tau_i = \partial_{t_i}{V}$, look like:
\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = t_1^2\,, \qquad \tau_4 = 2\, t_6\, t_7\,, \qquad \tau_6 = 2\, t_4\, t_7\,, \qquad \tau_7 = 2\, t_4\, t_6\,,
\end{equation}
and so, using the K\"ahler cone conditions (\ref{KCCA}), the overall volume reduces to:
\begin{equation}
{V} = t_4\tau_4-\frac13\, \tau_1^{3/2} = t_6\tau_6-\frac13\, \tau_1^{3/2}
= t_7\tau_7-\frac13\, \tau_1^{3/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,\sqrt{\tau_4\, \tau_6\, \tau_7} -\frac13\, \tau_1^{3/2}\,,
\end{equation}
which shows clearly that the CY threefold $X$ features three K3 fibrations over different ${P}^1$ bases. 
The second Chern class of $X$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
c_2 (X) = D_4 \, D_5 + 4\, D_5^2 + 12\, D_5 \, D_6 + 12\, D_5\, D_7 + 12\, D_6\, D_7\,,
\end{equation}
which results in the following values of the topological quantities $\Pi_i=\int_X c_2 \wedge \hat{D}_i$:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_1 = 8\,, \quad \Pi_2 = \Pi_3 =16\,, \quad \Pi_4 =24\,,
\quad \Pi_5 =16\,, \quad \Pi_6 = \Pi_7 =24\,, \quad\Pi_8 =128\,.

\subsection{Orientifold involution}

We focus on orientifold involutions of the form $\sigma: x_i \to - x_i$ with $i = 1, ...,8$  which feature an O7-plane on $D_i$ and O3-planes at the fixed points listed in Tab. \ref{FixedPointsA}. The effective non-trivial fixed point set in Tab. \ref{FixedPointsA} has been obtained after taking care of
the SR ideal symmetry. Moreover, the total number of O3-planes $N_{\rm O3}$ is obtained from the triple intersections restricted to the CY hypersurface, while the effective Euler number $\chi_{\rm eff}$ has been computed as:\footnote{The effective Euler number controls the strength of $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections due to O7-planes \cite{Minasian:2015bxa}.} 
\begin{equation}
\chi_{\rm eff} = \chi(X) +2\int_X [{\rm O7}] \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge [{\rm O7}]\,.
\label{chieff}
\end{equation}
In what follows we shall focus on the orientifold involution $\sigma: x_8\rightarrow-x_8$ which features just a single O7-plane located in $D_8$ and no O3-plane\,.

\subsection{Brane setup}

If the D7-tadpole cancellation condition is satisfied by placing four D7-branes on top of the O7-plane, the string loop corrections to the scalar potential can involve only KK effects between this D7-stack and O3-planes or D3-branes since winding contributions are absent due to the absence of any intersection between D7-branes and/or O7-planes. Thus loop effects are too simple to generate a viable inflationary plateau. They might even be completely absent in our case since there are no O3-planes and the D3-tadpole cancellation condition could be satisfied without the need to include D3-branes (i.e. just switching on appropriate background three-form fluxes). We shall therefore focus on a slightly more complicate D7-brane setup which gives rise to winding loop effects. This can be achieved by placing D7-branes not entirely on top of the O7-plane as follows:  
\begin{equation}
8[{\rm O7}] \equiv 8([D_8]) = 16 \left([D_2]+[D_4]+[D_6] \right)\,.
\end{equation}
This brane setup involves three stacks of D7-branes wrapped around the divisors $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_6$. Moreover, the condition for D3-tadpole cancellation becomes:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = \frac{N_{\rm O3}}{4} + \frac{\chi({\rm O7})}{12} + \sum_a\, \frac{N_a \left(\chi(D_a) + \chi(D_a^\prime) \right) }{48}  = 38 \,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
showing that there is space for turning on both gauge and background three-form fluxes for complex structure and dilaton stabilisation.\footnote{We focus on flux vacua where the dilaton is fixed in a regime where our perturbative type IIB analysis is under control.} As shown in \cite{Camara:2004jj}, three-form fluxes stabilise also D7 position moduli and open string moduli living at the intersection between two different stacks of D7-branes since they generate soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms for each of these scalars. On the other hand, there are no Wilson line moduli in our model since $h^{1,0}(D_2)=h^{1,0}(D_4) = h^{1,0}(D_6)=0$. 

Let us point out that other orientifold involutions which could allow for D7-branes not entirely on top of the O7-plane are $x_4 \to - x_4$, $x_6 \to - x_6$ or $x_7 \to - x_7$. In each of these cases, the O7-plane is located on a K3 surface. However, given that $D_4 = D_1 + D_5$, $D_6 = D_1 + D_3$ and $D_7 = D_1 +D_2$, from Tab. \ref{Tab2} and \ref{Tab3} we see that the resulting D7-brane stacks are either non-intersecting (and so no winding corrections are generated) or the volumes of the intersection curves depend just on the `small' dP$_7$ divisor (and so winding loops are inflaton-independent). This is the reason why we chose the involution $x_8 \to - x_8$ where the O7-plane is located on the `special deformation' divisor $D_8$ which gives more freedom for D7-brane model building. 

\subsection{Gauge fluxes}

In order to obtain a chiral visible sector on the D7-brane stacks wrapping $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_6$ we need to turn on worldvolume gauge fluxes of the form:
\begin{equation}
\F_i = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{ij}\hat{D}_j - \frac12 \,c_1({D}_i) - \iota_{D_i}^*B \quad\text{with}\quad f_{ij}\in \mathbb{Z} \quad\text{and}\quad i=2,4,6\,,
\end{equation}
where the half-integer contribution is due to Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation \cite{Minasian:1997mm, Freed:1999vc}. 

However we want to generate just one moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term in order to fix only one K\"ahler modulus via D-term stabilisation. In fact, if the number of FI-terms is larger than one, there is no light K\"ahler modulus which can play the r\^ole of the inflaton. Moreover we wrap a D3-brane instanton on the rigid divisor $D_1$ in order to generate a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential which is crucial for LVS moduli stabilisation. In order to cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly, the D3-instanton has to support a half-integer flux, and so the general expression of the total gauge flux on $D_1$ becomes (with $c_1(D_1) =-\hat{D}_1$):
\begin{equation}
\F_1 = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{1j}\hat{D}_j + \frac12 \hat{D}_1 - \iota_{D_i}^*B \quad\text{with}\quad f_{1j}\in \mathbb{Z}\,.
\end{equation}
However a non-vanishing $\F_1$ would not be gauge invariant, and so would prevent a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential. We need therefore to check if it is possible to perform an appropriate choice of $B$-field which can simultaneously set $\F_4=\F_6=0$ (we choose to have a non-vanishing gauge flux only on $D_2$ to have just one moduli-dependent FI-term) and $\F_1=0$. Recalling that both $D_4$ and $D_6$ are K3 surfaces which are spin divisors with $c_1(D_4)=c_1(D_6)=0$ (since the K3 is a CY two-fold), if we set:
\begin{equation}
B = \frac12 \,\hat{D}_1\,,
\label{BfieldA}
\end{equation}
the condition $\F_1=\F_4=\F_6=0$ reduces to the requirement that the following forms are integer:
\begin{equation}
\iota_{D_4}^* \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 \right) \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\iota_{D_6}^* \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 \right)\,,
\label{PullbacksA}
\end{equation}
since in this case the integer flux quanta $f_{ij}$ can always be adjusted to yield vanishing gauge fluxes. 
Taking an arbitrary integer form $A\in H^2(\mathbb{Z},X)$ which can be expanded as $A=a_j\hat{D}_j$ with $a_j \in \mathbb{Z}$, the pullbacks in (\ref{PullbacksA}) give rise to integer forms if:
\begin{eqnarray}
b_4 &\equiv& \int_X \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 \right) \wedge \hat{D}_4 \wedge A \in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\\ \\
b_6 &\equiv& \int_X \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 \right) \wedge \hat{D}_6 \wedge A \in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
Using the intersection polynomial (\ref{I3A}) we find $b_4 = b_6 = 0$, showing how the choice of $B$-field in (\ref{BfieldA}) can indeed allow for $\F_1=\F_4=\F_6=0$. The only non-zero gauge flux is $\F_2$ whose half-integer contribution can be cancelled by adding an additional term to the $B$-field of the form $\frac12 \hat{D}_2$. Given that all the intersection numbers are even, this new term in $B$ does not modify our previous results on the pullbacks of the $B$-field on $D_1$, $D_4$ and $D_6$. Moreover the pullback of the $B$-field on $D_2$ will also generate an integer flux contribution. We shall therefore consider a non-vanishing gauge flux on the worldvolume of $D_2$ of the form:
\begin{equation}
\F_2 = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{2j}\hat{D}_j \quad\text{with}\quad f_{2j}\in \mathbb{Z}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{FI-term and chirality}

Given that the divisor $D_2$ is transversely invariant under the orientifold involution and it is wrapped by eight D7-branes, it supports an $Sp(16)$ gauge group which is broken down to $U(8)=SU(8)\times U(1)$ by a non-zero flux $\F_2$ along the diagonal $U(1)$. This non-trivial gauge flux $\F_2$ induces also a $U(1)$-charge $q_{i2}$ for the $i$-th K\"ahler modulus of the form:
\begin{equation}
q_{i2} = \int_X \hat{D}_i \wedge \hat{D}_2 \wedge \F_2 \,.
\end{equation}
Thus $\F_2\neq 0$ yields (using $D_2=D_7-D_1$):
\begin{equation}
q_{12} =  - 2  f_{21} \qquad q_{42} =  2  f_{26} \qquad q_{62} =  2  f_{24} \qquad q_{72} = 0\,,
\end{equation}
together with a flux-dependent correction to the gauge kinetic function which looks like:
\begin{equation}
{\rm Re}(f_2)  = \alpha_2^{-1}=\frac{4\pi}{g_2^2}=\tau_2-h(\F_2) {\rm Re}(S)\,,
\end{equation}
where: 
\begin{equation}
h(\F_2) =\frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \F_2 \wedge \F_2 =\frac12\left(f_{21} q_{12} + f_{24} q_{42} + f_{26} q_{62}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover a non-vanishing gauge flux $\F_2$ induces a moduli-dependent FI-term of the form:
\begin{equation}
\xi =\frac{1}{4\pi{V}}\int_X \hat{D}_2\wedge J\wedge\F_2=\frac{1}{4\pi{V}}\sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} q_{j2}\,t_j
=\frac{1}{4\pi{V}} \left(q_{12}\,t_1+q_{42}\,t_4+q_{62}\,t_6\right)\,.
\end{equation}
For vanishing open string VEVs (induced for example by non-tachyonic scalar masses), a leading-order supersymmetric stabilisation requires $\xi=0$ which implies:
\begin{equation}
t_4 = - \frac{q_{12}}{q_{42}}\,t_1- \frac{q_{62}}{q_{42}}\,t_6\,.
\label{DfixA}
\end{equation}
This $U(1)$ factor becomes massive via the St\"uckelberg mechanism and develops an ${O}(M_s)$ mass by eating up a linear combination of an open and a closed string axion which is mostly given by the open string mode. 

Besides breaking the worldvolume gauge group and inducing moduli-dependent FI-terms, non-trivial gauge fluxes on D7-branes generate also 4D chiral modes. In fact, open strings stretching between the D7-branes on $D_2$ and the O7-planes or the image branes give rise to the following zero-modes in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of $U(8)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
I_2^{(S)} &=& - \frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge \F_2 - \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \hat{D}_2 \wedge \F_2 
= 2 q_{12} - q_{42} - q_{62}\,, \\
I_2^{(A)} &=& \frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge \F_2 - \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \hat{D}_2 \wedge \F_2 = q_{42} + q_{62}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Due to the absence of worldvolume fluxes on the D7-branes wrapped around $D_4$ and $D_6$, both of these two D7-stacks support an $Sp(16)$ gauge group (since both $D_4$ and $D_6$ are transversely invariant) which are both unbroken. Thus open strings stretched between the D7-branes on $D_2$ and $D_4$ or $D_6$ (or their image branes) give rise to 4D chiral zero-modes in the bi-fundamental representation ($8$,$16$) of $U(8)$ and $Sp(16)$ whose number is:
\begin{equation}
I_{24} = \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \hat{D}_4 \wedge \F_2 = q_{42}\,, \qquad
I_{26} = \int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \hat{D}_6 \wedge \F_2 = q_{62}\,.
\end{equation}
We need finally to check that there are no chiral intersections between the D7s on $D_2$ and the instanton on $D_1$ to make sure that the prefactor of the non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential is indeed non-zero. This is ensured if:
\begin{equation}
I_{21}=\int_X \hat{D}_2 \wedge \hat{D}_1 \wedge \F_2 = q_{12} =  - 2  f_{21} = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
This condition can be easily satisfied by choosing $f_{21}=0$. In turn, this choice simplifies the D-term constraint (\ref{DfixA}) to:
\begin{equation}
t_4 = - \frac{q_{62}}{q_{42}}\,t_6 \equiv \alpha \,t_6 \,.
\label{DfixAA}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Inflationary potential}

Using the D-term fixing relation (\ref{DfixAA}), the K\"ahler cone conditions (\ref{KCCA}) simplify to $t_7>-t_1>0$ together with $t_6>-t_1>0$ if $\alpha\geq 1$ or $\alpha t_6>-t_1>0$ if $\alpha\leq 1$. Moreover the CY volume (\ref{VolA}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
{V} = 2\alpha t_7 t_6^2 + \frac{t_1^3}{3} = t_7 \tau_7 -\frac13 \,\tau_1^{3/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\alpha}}\,\sqrt{\tau_7}\,\tau_6-\frac13\,\tau_1^{3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
Given that this form is linear in $t_7$, the effective CY volume after D-term stabilisation looks like a single K3 fibre $\tau_7$ over a ${P}^1$ base $t_7$ and reduces to the typical form used in fibre inflation models. The blow-up mode $\tau_1$ and the overall volume ${V}$ are stabilised in the LVS fashion by means of a non-perturbative correction to $W$ generated by an Euclidean D3-brane instanton wrapping $D_1$. This leaves the fibre modulus $\tau_7$ as a flat direction which receives a potential at subleading order.

Let us now focus on the inflationary potential. The winding loop corrections can be written as (with $\kappa=g_s/(8\pi)$ for $e^{K_{\rm cs}}=1$):
\begin{equation}
V^\W_{g_s}=-2\,\kappa\,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\,\sum_i\frac{C_i^\W}{t_i^\cap}\,,
\end{equation} 
where $t_i^\cap$ are the volumes of the two-cycles where D7-branes/O7-planes intersect. Notice that if two coordinate divisors $D_i$ and $D_j$ are wrapped by D7-branes and/or O7-planes, the scalar potential receives $t^\cap$-dependent winding loop corrections only if their intersection curve contains
non-contractible 1-cycles, i.e. if $h^{1,0}(D_i \cap D_j)\neq 0$. In our case, we have an O7-plane located on $D_8$ and three stacks of D7-branes wrapping $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_6$. Using Tab. \ref{Tab2} and \ref{Tab3}, we see all D7s intersect with each other and with the O7 and that winding corrections can arise from any of these intersections.  Thus we end up with: 
\begin{equation}
V^\W_{g_s} =-\,\kappa\,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\,
\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau_7}} \left( C_\W - \tilde{C}_\W(\tau_7)\right) -\frac{\tau_7}{{V}} \left(|C_3^\W| - \hat{C}_\W(\tau_7)\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where (setting $t_4=\alpha t_6$, $C_3^\W = - |C_3^\W|<0$ and $C_4^\W = - |C_4^\W|<0$):
\begin{equation}
C_\W = \sqrt{2\alpha}\left(C_1^\W+\frac{C_2^\W}{\alpha}\right) \qquad 
\tilde{C}_\W (\tau_7)= \frac{|C_4^\W|}{(\alpha+1)}\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{2\,\alpha}}{(\alpha+1)}\,\sqrt{\frac{\langle\tau_1\rangle}{\tau_7}}\right)^{-1}\,,
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\hat{C}_\W (\tau_7) = \frac{C_5^\W}{2} \left(1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\alpha}}\frac{\tau_7^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)^{-1}
+ \frac{C_6^\W}{2} \left(1+\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\,\frac{\tau_7^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)^{-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Due to the absence of O3-planes (we also assume that the D3-tadpoles are cancelled without including any spacetime-filling D3-branes) and the fact that all D7s intersect with each other and with the O7-plane, there are no 1-loop corrections due to the exchange of closed strings carrying KK momentum.\footnote{Strictly speaking, there might be 1-loop corrections associated with the exchange of KK modes between the Euclidean D3-instanton on $D_1$ and the D7-branes which do not intersect $D_1$. However, we expect such corrections to be exponentially suppressed and, thus, not relevant for the analysis.}

On the other hand, higher derivative $\alpha'^3\,F^4$ corrections to the scalar potential can be written as \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}:\footnote{This expression displays merely the leading order ${O}({V}^{-4})$ terms which are corrected at subleading order in inverse volume by additional corrections as discussed in \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. Furthermore, additional higher-derivative corrections mediated by the auxiliary fields sitting in the supergravity multiplet might emerge at order ${O}({V}^{-5})$ \cite{Cicoli:2016chb, Ciupke:2016agp}.}
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4}=-\kappa^2\,\frac{\lambda\,W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}\,{V}^4}\,\sum_{i=1}^{h^{1,1}}\Pi_i\,t_i\,,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is an unknown combinatorial factor which is expected to be of order $10^{-3}$ \cite{Ciupke:2015msa, Grimm:2017okk} and the topological quantities $\Pi_i$ are given in (\ref{Pi'sA}). After imposing the D-term condition (\ref{DfixAA}), the $F^4$ contributions can be rewritten as (ignoring the $t_1$-dependent term):
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4} = -24\kappa^2\,\frac{\lambda\,W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}\,{V}^3}\,\left[\frac{(\alpha+1)}{\sqrt{2\,\alpha}}\,\frac{\sqrt{\tau_7}}{{V}}+\frac{1}{\tau_7}\right].
\end{equation}
Therefore the total inflationary potential becomes:
\begin{equation}
V = V_{g_s}^\W+V_{F^4}= \kappa\,\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\,
\left(\frac{A_1}{\tau_7}-\frac{A_2}{\sqrt{\tau_7}}  + \frac{B_1\sqrt{\tau_7}}{{V}}+\frac{B_2 \,\tau_7}{{V}}\right)\,,
\label{exA_tot_pot}
\end{equation}
where (with $\lambda=-|\lambda|<0$):
\begin{equation}
A_1 = \frac{3}{\pi}  \frac{|\lambda| W_0^2}{\sqrt{g_s}} \qquad A_2 = C_\W - \tilde{C}_\W(\tau_7)
\qquad B_1 = \frac{(\alpha+1)}{\sqrt{2\,\alpha}}\,A_1
\qquad B_2 = |C_3^\W| - \hat{C}_\W(\tau_7)\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}

\section{Inflationary dynamics}
\label{InfAn}

In this section we shall analyse the inflationary dynamics by studying first the single-field approximation and then by focusing on the full multi-field evolution.

\subsection{Single-field evolution}
\label{exA_inf}

In order to realise single-field slow-roll inflation where the potential for the inflaton $\tau_7$ features a plateau-type region \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Cicoli:2016chb}, the overall volume has to be approximately constant during the whole inflationary dynamics. Therefore, in order to get enough efoldings before reaching the dangerous limit where the base of the fibration $t_7$ becomes smaller than the string scale, we need to focus on the region in field space where the inflaton minimum is of order $\langle\tau_7\rangle\ll {V}^{2/3}$. For $g_s\lesssim{O}(0.1)$, $|\lambda|\sim{O}(10^{-3})$ and natural ${O}(1)$ values of the coefficients of the string loop effects, in the vicinity of the minimum the terms in (\ref{exA_tot_pot}) proportional to $B_1$ and $B_2$ are therefore both negligible with respect to the terms proportional to $A_1$ and $A_2$. Numerical estimates show that we need values of order $\langle\tau_7\rangle \sim{O}(1)$ and ${V} \sim{O}(10^4)$ which, in turn, imply $W_0\sim{O}(100)$ in order to match the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. 

The scalar potential (\ref{exA_tot_pot}) written in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton shifted from its minimum $\phi = \langle \phi \rangle + \hat\phi$, where $\tau_7 = \langle \tau_7 \rangle \,e^{k\hat\phi}$ with $k=2/\sqrt{3}$, becomes:
\begin{equation}
V = \kappa\,\frac{A_2 W_0^2}{{V}^3 \sqrt{\langle\tau_7\rangle}}\, \left(C_\dS + c\,e^{-k\hat\phi}- e^{-\frac{k\hat\phi}{2}} 
 + {R}_1\,e^{\frac{k\hat\phi}{2}} +{R}_2\,e^{k\hat\phi}\right),
\label{VtotA}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
c = \frac{3}{\pi\left(C_\W - \tilde{C}_\W(\tau_7)\right)}
\frac{|\lambda| W_0^2}{\sqrt{g_s \langle\tau_7\rangle}}\sim {O}(1)\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
while for $\langle\tau_7\rangle\sim {O}(1)\ll{V}^{2/3}$:
\begin{equation}
{R}_1 = \frac{(\alpha+1) c}{\sqrt{2\,\alpha}} \frac{\langle\tau_7\rangle^{3/2}}{{V}}\ll 1
\qquad \text{and}\qquad {R}_2 = \frac{\left(|C_3^\W| - \hat{C}_\W(\tau_7)\right)}{\left(C_\W - \tilde{C}_\W(\tau_7)\right)} 
\frac{\langle\tau_7\rangle^{3/2}}{{V}}\ll 1 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Notice that in (\ref{VtotA}) we added a constant $C_\dS= 1-c - {R}_1 - {R}_2$ to obtain a Minkowski (or slightly dS) vacuum. Given that no O3-planes are present in our model, the usual uplift mechanism where an anti D3-brane is located in a resolved conifold region of the extra dimensions would require additional effort to implement. We leave the explicit embedding of the source of uplift to future research. 

The two negative exponentials in (\ref{VtotA}) compete to give a minimum at $\langle\tau_7\rangle \sim{O}(1)$ while the two positive exponentials cause a steepening behaviour at large $\hat\phi$. Thus we need to make sure that both ${R}_1\ll 1$ and ${R}_2\ll 1$ to prevent the two positive exponentials from destroying the inflationary plateau before achieving enough efoldings of inflation.\footnote{If this is the case, these steepening terms could then be responsible for an interesting power loss at large angular scales \cite{Cicoli:2013oba}.} The condition ${R}_1\ll 1$ could be satisfied for $c\ll 1$, for example for $W_0\sim{O}(1)$ and $\langle\tau_7\rangle \gg 1$, in which case the minimum could be obtained by balancing the two terms in the coefficient $A_2$. However, as we shall see below, if $\langle\tau_7\rangle \gg 1$, the K\"ahler cone bounds restrict the allowed field space so much that it becomes impossible to realise enough efoldings of inflation. Hence we shall focus the region where ${R}_1\ll 1$ and ${R}_2\ll 1$ are satisfied by $\langle\tau_7\rangle\sim {O}(1)\ll{V}^{2/3}$ (and possibly by allowing some tuning of the complex structure moduli-dependent coefficients of the loop corrections or by considering $|\lambda|\ll 1$).  

Turning now to the explicit numerical examples, let us formulate the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied in order to have a viable model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stringy effects can be neglected if each four-cycle in string frame has a volume larger than the string scale: ${\rm Vol}_s^{1/4}\gg \sqrt{\alpha'}$. Given that string and Einstein frame volumes are related as ${\rm Vol}_s = g_s {\rm Vol}_E = g_s \tau_E \ell_s$ with $\ell_s = 2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'}$, we end up with the condition:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\tau_i} \equiv \frac{1}{g_s (2\pi)^4 \, \tau_i} \ll 1\qquad\forall\,i\,.
\label{epsAppr}
\end{equation}
\item The whole inflationary dynamics should take place inside the K\"ahler cone. This implies in particular that:
\begin{eqnarray}
2\alpha \langle\tau_1 \rangle &<& \tau_7 < \frac{{V}}{\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\qquad\text{if}\qquad \alpha\geq 1\,, \nonumber\\ \\
\frac{2}{\alpha} \langle\tau_1 \rangle &<& \tau_7 < \frac{{V}}{\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\qquad\text{if}\qquad  \alpha\leq 1\,. 
\label{KCA}
\end{eqnarray}
Notice that these conditions guarantee the absence of any singularity in the inflationary potential (\ref{VtotA}) which could originate from the shrinking of a two-cycle to zero size. Rewriting these conditions in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton field, we end up with:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ln\left(\frac{2\alpha\langle\tau_1 \rangle}{\langle\tau_7\rangle}\right) &<& \hat{\phi} 
< \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\ln\left(\frac{{V}}{\langle\tau_7\rangle\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\right) \qquad\text{if}\qquad \alpha\geq 1\,, \nonumber\\ \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ln\left(\frac{2\langle\tau_1 \rangle}{\alpha\langle\tau_7\rangle}\right) &<& \hat{\phi} 
< \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ln\left(\frac{{V}}{\langle\tau_7\rangle\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\right)\qquad\text{if}\qquad  \alpha\leq 1\,. 
\label{KConeA}
\end{eqnarray}
In order to be able to describe within a consistent EFT, not just inflation but also the post-inflationary evolution of our model, $\hat\phi$ should reach its minimum before hitting the lower bounds in (\ref{KConeA}). Moreover the inflaton should drive enough efoldings of inflation before hitting the upper bounds in (\ref{KConeA}).

\item Horizon exit at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_*$ should yield the required number of efoldings:
\begin{equation}
N_e\simeq 57 + \frac14 \ln \left(r_*\, V_*\right)- \frac13 \ln\left(\frac{V_{\rm end}}{T_{\rm rh}}\right),
\label{Nenumber}
\end{equation}
where the reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$ can be estimated in terms of the inflaton mass at the minimum $m_{\hat\phi}$ as:
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm rh} \simeq \left(\frac{90}{\pi^2  g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{1/4} \sqrt{\Gamma_{\hat\phi} M_p}
\simeq 0.1 \,m_{\hat\phi}\, \sqrt{\frac{m_{\hat\phi}}{M_p}}\,.
\label{Trh}
\end{equation}

\item Horizon exit at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_*$ should reproduce the observed amplitude of the density perturbations:
\begin{equation}
\frac{V_*^3}{V_*^{'2}} \simeq 2.6 \cdot 10^{-7}\,.
\label{COBE}
\end{equation}

\item The $\alpha'$ expansion of the potential can be trusted only if:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\xi = \frac{\xi}{2 g_s^{3/2} {V}} \ll 1\,.
\end{equation}

\item The effective field theory is under control if throughout all the inflationary dynamics:
\begin{equation}
m_{\rm inf} < H < m_{3/2} < M_\KK^{(i)} < M_s < M_p \qquad\forall i = {\rm bulk},2,4,6\,,
\label{Hierarchies}
\end{equation}
where $m_{\rm inf}$ is the inflaton mass, $H\simeq \frac{V}{3 M_p^2}$ is the Hubble scale, $m_{3/2} = e^{K/2} W_0 = \sqrt{\kappa} \,\frac{W_0}{{V}}\,M_p$ is the gravitino mass which sets the mass scale of all complex structure moduli, the dilaton and the K\"ahler modulus $T_1 = \tau_1 + {\rm i}\int_{D_1} C_4$ and $M_\KK^{(i)} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{{V}}\,\tau_i^{1/4}}\,M_p$ are the different KK scales in the model associated with bulk KK modes for $\tau_\b^{3/2} = {V}$ and KK replicas of open string modes living on D7-branes wrapped around $D_2$, $D_4$ and $D_6$. The bulk KK scale should be below the string scale $M_s = \frac{g_s^{1/4} \sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{{V}}}\,M_p$ while we do not need to impose $V^{1/4} < M_\KK^{(i)}$ since no energy can be extracted from the vacuum during an adiabatic inflationary expansion where $H\ll M_\KK^{(i)}$. 

\item Besides the two ultra-light axions associated with the base and the fibre which develop just negligible isocurvature fluctuations during inflation if they do not contribute significantly to dark matter, only the volume mode has a mass below $m_{3/2}$. In order to trust our single field approximation, we need therefore to check that the mass of the volume mode $m_{V}$ does not become smaller than the Hubble scale $H$. This condition boils down to:
\begin{equation}
\delta = \frac{H}{m_{{V}}} \simeq \sqrt{\frac{V_*}{3 V_{\alpha'}}} \lesssim 1\,,
\label{singlefield}
\end{equation}
where $V_{\alpha'}$ is the leading ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ contribution to the scalar potential and reads \cite{Becker:2002nn}:
\begin{equation}
V_{\alpha'} = \kappa \frac{3 \xi W_0^2}{4 g_s^{3/2} {V}^3}\qquad\text{with}\qquad \xi=-\frac{\zeta(3)\chi(X)}{2 (2\pi)^3} \,.
\label{a3F2}
\end{equation}
If $\delta\simeq 1$, the inflationary energy density can either destabilise the volume direction or cause a significant shift of the volume minimum. Hence the inflationary dynamics can effectively become a multi-field evolution. However, as analysed in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, the motion might still remain mainly along the $\tau_7$ direction, and so the predictions for the inflationary observables could be basically unaltered apart from the fact that the number of allowed efoldings slightly increases. Notice also that in LVS models the CY Euler number together with the string coupling fixes the minimum of the blow-up mode $\tau_1$ as: $\langle\tau_1\rangle = (3\xi/2)^{2/3}\,g_s^{-1}$. This value is important to evaluate the K\"ahler cone conditions in (\ref{KConeA}).
\end{enumerate}
We shall now focus on single-field slow-roll inflation where:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon (\hat\phi) = \frac12 \left(\frac{V'}{V}\right)^2 \ll 1\qquad\text{and}\qquad\eta (\hat\phi) = \frac{V''}{V}\ll 1\,. \nonumber\\
\label{eq:slow_roll}
\end{equation}
Notice that the condition $\eta\ll 1$ guarantees that the inflaton is lighter than $H$ during inflation. In order to illustrate the main features of our inflationary model, we shall now consider two different choices of the underlying parameters characterised by different values of the coefficients $\xi$ and $\lambda$ which control the strength of the ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections to the effective action at ${O}(F^2)$ and ${O}(F^4)$. According to \cite{Minasian:2015bxa}, $N=1$ ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections due to O7-planes cause a shift of the CY Euler number $\chi(X)$ to $\chi_{\rm eff}(X)$ defined in (\ref{chieff}) and given in Tab. \ref{FixedPointsA}. From (\ref{a3F2}) this modification would give $\xi = 0.067$. Moreover the coefficient $\lambda$ of higher derivative ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ effects has been estimated to be negative and of order $10^{-3}$ \cite{Ciupke:2015msa, Grimm:2017okk}. Hence the first set of parameters will be characterised by $\xi=0.067$ and $\lambda=-0.001$. However both of these corrections still lack a full supersymmetric analysis, and so in the second case we shall focus on a situation where the CY Euler number is not modified, and so $\xi = 0.456$, and the size of the coefficient $\lambda$ is much smaller: $|\lambda|\lesssim 10^{-6}$.


\subsubsection{Case 1: $\xi = 0.067$ and $|\lambda| = 0.001$}
\label{BadCase}

Let us now provide an explicit numerical example set to demonstrate the features of our inflationary model:
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha &=& 1\,, \quad C^\W_1=C^\W_2=15\,, \quad |C^\W_3|=0.013\,, \quad |C^\W_4| =18\,,\quad C^\W_5 = C^\W_6 =-5\,,  \nonumber\\ \\ 
g_s &=& 0.114\,, \quad {V}=10^4 \,, \quad \langle\tau_1 \rangle = 1.91\,,\quad W_0=80\,, \quad |\lambda|=0.001\,,
\label{ex_set_exA}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\chi(X)=\chi_{\rm eff}(X)= -28$ in (\ref{a3F2}) which gives $\xi = 0.067$. Notice that the tuning of the steepening term here is mild since the difference between the largest and the smallest winding coefficient is between one and two orders of magnitude. The form of the inflationary potential is plotted in Fig. \ref{ExA_pot} and it is characterised by: 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, angle=0]{PotAnew.eps}
\caption{Plot of the inflationary potential for the example set (\ref{ex_set_exA}). The red vertical lines correspond to the walls of the K\"ahler cone while the dashed vertical lines denote horizon exit and the end of inflation where $\epsilon=1$.} 
\label{ExA_pot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\langle \tau_7 \rangle = 4.002$ leading to $\epsilon_{\langle \tau_7 \rangle} = 0.0014$. Moreover $2\langle \tau_1 \rangle \simeq 3.8$, and so the distance of the minimum from the lower bound of the K\"ahler cone is $\Delta \tau_7\simeq 0.178$ which is still larger than the string scale since, using (\ref{epsAppr}), we have that:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\Delta \tau_7} = \frac{1}{g_s (2\pi)^4 \Delta  \tau_7 } \simeq 0.03\,.
\end{equation}

\item The K\"ahler cone bounds (\ref{KConeA}) in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton become $\hat\phi_{\rm min}\simeq -0.04 <\hat\phi < \hat\phi_{\rm max}\simeq 6.49$. Inflation ends at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_{\rm end}\simeq 0.96$ where $\epsilon(\hat\phi_{\rm end})=1$ and $V_{\rm end}\simeq \left(7 \cdot 10^{15}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4$. Horizon exit takes place at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_*\simeq 6.24$ where $r=16\epsilon = 0.009$, $n_s = 1+ 2\eta_* - 6\epsilon_* =  0.983$, $V_* \simeq  \left(1\cdot 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4$ and the amplitude normalisation (\ref{COBE}) is satisfied. Notice that such a largish value of the scalar spectral index is in perfect agreement with Planck data in the presence of dark radiation since, using $\Delta N_{\rm eff}=0.39$ as a prior, \cite{Ade:2015xua} gives as best fit $n_s = 0.983 \pm 0.006$. This prior is fully justified in string models like ours where reheating is driven by the decay of the lightest modulus which naturally tends to produce extra axionic contributions to dark radiation \cite{Cicoli:2012aq, Higaki:2012ar, Hebecker:2014gka, Cicoli:2015bpq}. 

\item Horizon exit occurs well inside the K\"ahler cone since from (\ref{KCA}) we have:
\begin{equation}
\tau_7^* = e^{\kappa (\langle\phi\rangle +\hat\phi_* )} \simeq 5404.82 < \tau_7^{\rm max} = \frac{{V}}{\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\simeq 7231.87 \quad\Rightarrow\quad  \tau_7^{\rm max} - \tau_7^* \simeq 1827.06 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}

\item The mass of the inflaton around the minimum is $m_{\hat\phi} \simeq 4.25 \cdot 10^{13}$ GeV which from (\ref{Trh}) implies a reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh} \simeq 1.8 \cdot 10^{10}$ GeV.

\item The number of efoldings computed as:
\begin{equation}
N_e = \int^{\hat\phi_*}_{\hat\phi_{\rm end}} \frac{V}{V'}\,d\hat\phi\,,
\end{equation}
gives $N_e=52$ as required by the estimate (\ref{Nenumber}). The maximum number of efoldings between $\hat\phi_{\rm end}$ and $\hat\phi_{\rm max}$ is $N_e^{\rm max}\simeq 60$. 

\item The $\alpha'$ expansion is under control even if in our inflationary model the inflaton travels over a trans-Planckian distance of order $\Delta \hat\phi = \hat\phi_*-\hat\phi_{\rm end} = 5.28$ since we have $\epsilon_\xi\sim 10^{-4}$.

\item The mass of the volume mode is of order the Hubble scale during inflation since $\delta\simeq 1.6$. Hence the inflationary energy density could either cause a significant shift of the original LVS minimum or destabilise the volume direction. A definite answer to this question would require a more careful multi-field analysis. As mentioned above, a similar situation has been studied in \cite{Cicoli:2008gp}, where the authors found that for $\delta \sim 1$ the minimum for the volume mode gets a large shift but the inflationary evolution still remains mostly single-field since $m_{\rm inf}\ll m_{V}\sim H$. However if $\delta\sim 1$, the inflationary potential generated by string loops and $\alpha'^3$ $F^4$ terms is of the same order as the $\alpha'^3$ $F^2$ contribution, and so one also should carefully check if additional higher derivative corrections can be safely neglected.

\item The effective field theory approximation is valid during the whole inflationary evolution since $H \simeq 2 \cdot 10^{13} \,{\rm GeV} < m_{3/2}\simeq 1 \cdot 10^{15} \,{\rm GeV} < M_\KK^{\rm bulk} \simeq 9 \cdot 10^{15} \,{\rm GeV} < M_s \simeq 2.5 \cdot 10^{16} \,{\rm GeV}$. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, angle=0]{KKmassesAnew.eps}
\caption{Comparison between the different KK masses, $m_{3/2}$ and the inflationary energy density $V^{1/4}$ from horizon exit to the end of inflation. Note that $M_\KK^{(4)} = M_\KK^{(6)}$ which is why only one of them is displayed here.} 
\label{Fig:exA_KK_masses}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We display the evolution of the different KK masses as compared to the gravitino mass and the inflationary scale $M_{\rm inf} = V^{1/4}$ in Fig.~\ref{Fig:exA_KK_masses}. Notice, in particular, that at the end of inflation the inflationary scale is of order $M_\KK^{\rm bulk}$ and, above all, mildly exceeds the KK scale $M_\KK^{(4)}$ by a factor of roughly $1.3$. As we stressed above, during an adiabatic expansion no energy can be extracted from the vacuum, and so our EFT is still valid even if some KK scales become smaller than $V^{1/4}$ since they are all always larger than $m_{3/2}$ which is, in turn, larger than $H$.
However, since all the inflationary energy density could instead be converted into particle production at reheating, one should make sure that there is enough Hubble friction between the end of inflation and reheating to bring the inflaton energy density below the relevant KK scale. This effect can be estimated by noticing that from: 
\begin{equation}
\rho(\phi)=\frac12 \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) = 3 H^2 M_p^2 \qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad\partial_t \rho(\phi) = - 3 H\dot{\phi}^2\,,
\end{equation}
we can obtain the following relation between the energy density at the end of inflation and at reheating:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm rh} = \rho_{\rm end} - 3 \langle \dot{\phi}^2 \rangle\, \int_{\rm end}^{\rm rh} \frac{da}{a} 
= \rho_{\rm end} - 3 N_{\rm rh} \langle \dot{\phi}^2 \rangle\,,
\end{equation}
where $\langle \dot{\phi}^2 \rangle$ is the time average between the end of inflation and reheating and $N_{\rm rh}=\ln(a_{\rm rh}/a_{\rm end})$ is the number of efoldings of the reheating epoch. At the end of inflation when $\epsilon=1$ we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac12 \dot{\phi}^2 = H^2 M_p^2 \qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad \rho_{\rm end} = \frac32 V_{\rm end} \simeq 10 \left(M_\KK^{(4)}\right)^4\,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand at reheating $V(\phi_{\rm rh})\simeq 0$, and so $\rho_{\rm rh}\simeq \dot{\phi}_{\rm rh}^2/2$. If we then write the time-average kinetic energy as $\langle \dot{\phi}^2 \rangle =  \dot{\phi}_{\rm rh}^2/x \simeq 2\rho_{\rm rh}/x$ with $x>0$, we end up with the following bound:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm rh} \simeq  \frac{10}{1+\frac6x N_{\rm rh}} \left(M_\KK^{(4)}\right)^4 < \left(M_\KK^{(4)}\right)^4\,.
\label{estimate}
\end{equation}
Using the fact that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:N_rh}
N_{\rm rh} \simeq \frac13 \ln\left(\frac{H_{\rm end}^2 M_p^2}{T_{\rm rh}^4}\right)-\frac13\ln\left(\frac{\pi^2 g_*}{90}\right)\simeq 16\,,
\end{equation}
the bound (\ref{estimate}) becomes $x < \tfrac{2}{3} N_{\rm rh} \simeq 10$. Our model should satisfy this bound since we expect $\dot{\phi}_{\rm end}$ to approach $\dot{\phi}_{\rm rh}$ relatively quickly due to the steepness of the potential near the end of inflation. However a definite answer would require a detailed study of the post-inflationary epoch which is beyond the scope of this paper.\footnote{Let us also point out that, even if $\rho_{\rm rh}\gtrsim \left(M_\KK^{(4)}\right)^4$, our model is not necessarily ruled out but we would just need to describe reheating within a 6D EFT where the base of the fibration is much larger than the characteristic size of the fibre. It would also be interesting to find brane setups where this problem is automatically absent since there is no D7-brane wrapped around the base.} 

Let us also mention that, due to the absence of KK corrections, this scenario represents a chiral global embedding of the $\alpha'$-inflation models discussed in \cite{Cicoli:2016chb}. Moreover, no KK scale becomes smaller than the gravitino mass even if $r\simeq 0.01$ and $\Delta \hat\phi \simeq 5$ in Planck units. In fact, if we focus for example on the KK scale $M_\KK^{(2)}$ associated with the K3 fibre (similar considerations apply to the KK scale $M_\KK^{(6)}$ associated with the base), we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_\KK^{(2)}} = \alpha_1\,e^{\alpha_2 \phi}\simeq 0.03\,e^{\alpha_2 \phi}\,,
\label{KKratioo}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_1 = \sqrt{\frac{W_0}{2\pi}}\,\left(\frac{g_s}{2\pi}\right)^{1/4}\,\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_p}}\simeq 0.03 \qquad\text{and}\qquad \alpha_2 = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
If we set $\phi=\phi_0 + \hat\phi_{\rm he} \simeq 7.44$, the ratio in (\ref{KKratioo}) becomes $m_{3/2}/M_\KK^{(2)} \simeq 0.26$, and so the KK scale $M_\KK^{(2)}$ is always larger than the gravitino mass throughout all the inflationary dynamics. Notice that this result seems to be in slight disagreement with the swampland conjecture of \cite{Klaewer:2016kiy, Blumenhagen:2017cxt} where the underlying parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ were generically assumed to be of order unity. 

As explained above, given that in this case $\delta\simeq 1.6$, the inflationary dynamics can be fully trusted only after determining the proper multi-field evolution. Due to the difficulty to perform a full numerical analysis, in the next section we shall instead still focus on a single-field case where $\delta\sim 0.05$ since $\xi$ is larger, and so the volume mode mass is larger, while $|\lambda|$ is smaller, and so $F^4$ steepening terms can be easily neglected throughout the whole inflationary dynamics. The full three-field evolution for both of these cases will then be presented in Sec. \ref{Multi}.


\subsubsection{Case 2: $\xi = 0.456$ and $|\lambda| = 10^{-7}$}
\label{GoodCase}

According the discussion above, we shall now focus on the following different choice of the underlying parameters:
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha &=& 1\,, \quad C^\W_1=C^\W_2=0.034\,, \quad |C^\W_3|=10^{-5}\,, \quad |C^\W_4| =0.068\,,\quad C^\W_5 = C^\W_6 =-0.024\,,  \nonumber\\ \\ 
g_s &=& 0.25\,, \quad {V}=4500 \,, \quad \langle\tau_1\rangle= 3.10\,, \quad W_0=150\,, \quad |\lambda|=10^{-7}\,,
\label{ex_set_exA2}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\chi(X)=\chi_{\rm eff}(X)= -188$ in (\ref{a3F2}) which gives $\xi = 0.456$. A larger value of the coefficient $\xi$ is helpful to increase the control on the single-field approximation since, as can be seen from (\ref{a3F2}), the leading ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ contribution to the scalar potential is proportional to $\xi$. The form of the inflationary potential is plotted in Fig. \ref{ExA2_pot} and it is characterised by: 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, angle=0]{P1new2.eps}
\caption{Plot of the inflationary potential for the example set (\ref{ex_set_exA2}). The red vertical lines correspond to the walls of the K\"ahler cone while the dashed vertical lines denote horizon exit and the end of inflation where $\epsilon=1$.} 
\label{ExA2_pot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\langle \tau_7 \rangle \simeq 6.41$ leading to $\epsilon_{\langle \tau_7 \rangle} \simeq 0.0004$ and $\langle\phi\rangle \simeq 1.61$. Moreover $2\langle \tau_1 \rangle \simeq 6.2$, and so the minimum is located close to the walls of the K\"ahler cone but at a distance $\Delta \tau_7\simeq 0.21$ which is still larger than the string scale since, using (\ref{epsAppr}), we have that:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\Delta \tau_7} = \frac{1}{g_s (2\pi)^4 \Delta  \tau_7 } \simeq 0.01\,.
\end{equation}

\item The K\"ahler cone bounds (\ref{KConeA}) in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton become $\hat\phi_{\rm min}\simeq -0.028 <\hat\phi < \hat\phi_{\rm max}\simeq 5.19$. Inflation ends at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_{\rm end}\simeq 0.93$ where $\epsilon(\hat\phi_{\rm end})=1$ and $V_{\rm end}=\left(4.4\cdot 10^{15}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4$. Horizon exit takes place at $\hat\phi=\hat\phi_*\simeq 5.10$ where $r=16\epsilon = 0.0014$, $n_s = 1+ 2\eta_* - 6\epsilon_* =  0.963$, $V_* = \left(6.2\cdot 10^{15}\,{\rm GeV}\right)^4$ and the amplitude normalisation (\ref{COBE}) is satisfied. Notice that horizon exit occurs far away from the upper bound of the K\"ahler cone since from (\ref{KCA}) we have:
\begin{equation}
\tau_7^* = e^{\kappa (\langle\phi\rangle +\hat\phi_* )} \simeq 2325.79 < \tau_7^{\rm max} = \frac{{V}}{\sqrt{\langle\tau_1 \rangle}}\simeq 2554.55 \quad\Rightarrow\quad  \tau_7^{\rm max} - \tau_7^* \simeq 228.76 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}

\item The mass of the inflaton around the minimum is $m_{\hat\phi} \simeq 1.85 \cdot 10^{13}$ GeV which from (\ref{Trh}) implies a reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh} \simeq 5.16 \cdot 10^9$ GeV.

\item The number of efoldings computed as:
\begin{equation}
N_e = \int^{\hat\phi_*}_{\hat\phi_{\rm end}} \frac{V}{V'}\,d\hat\phi\,,
\end{equation}
gives $N_e=51$ as required by the estimate (\ref{Nenumber}). The maximum number of efoldings between $\hat\phi_{\rm end}$ and $\hat\phi_{\rm max}$ is $N_e^{\rm max}\simeq 57.5$.  

\item The $\alpha'$ expansion is under control even if in our inflationary model the inflaton travels over a trans-Planckian distance of order $\Delta \hat\phi = \hat\phi_*-\hat\phi_{\rm end} = 4.17$ since we have $\epsilon_\xi\simeq 0.0004$.

\item The single-field approximation is under control since $\delta\simeq 0.05$.

\item The effective field theory approximation is valid during the whole inflationary evolution since $H\simeq 7\cdot 10^{12} \,{\rm GeV}< m_{3/2}\simeq 8\cdot 10^{15} \,{\rm GeV} < M_\KK^{\rm bulk} \simeq 1.6 \cdot 10^{16} \,{\rm GeV} < M_s \simeq 4.5 \cdot 10^{16} \,{\rm GeV}$. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, angle=0]{Kkknew.eps}
\caption{Comparison between the different KK masses, the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ and the inflationary energy $V^{1/4}$ from horizon exit to the end of inflation. Note that $M_\KK^{(4)} = M_\KK^{(6)}$ which is why only one of them is displayed here.} 
\label{Fig:exA2_KK_masses}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We display the evolution of the different KK masses as compared to the gravitino mass and the inflationary energy density $M_{\rm inf} = V^{1/4}$ in Fig.~\ref{Fig:exA2_KK_masses}. Notice that, contrary to case $1$ where $r=0.01$, all KK scales remain above $M_{\rm inf}$ throughout all the inflationary dynamics. The reason is that in this scale the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and so also the inflationary scale, is smaller since $r=0.001$. Moreover, as stressed above, no energy can be extracted from the vacuum during an adiabatic expansion, and so the consistency condition to be imposed during inflation is $H\ll M_\KK^{(i)}$ which is clearly satisfied since $H = \frac{M_{\rm inf}}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{M_{\rm inf}}{M_p}\right) < M_{\rm inf}$. Moreover, no KK scale becomes smaller than the gravitino mass $m_{3/2} \simeq 8 \cdot 10^{15}$ GeV. If we focus for example on the KK scale $M_\KK^{(2)}$ associated with the K3 fibre (similar considerations apply to the KK scale $M_\KK^{(6)}$ associated with the base of the fibration), we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_\KK^{(2)}} = \alpha_1\,e^{\alpha_2 \phi}\simeq 0.126\,e^{\alpha_2 \phi}\,,
\label{KKratio}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_1 = \sqrt{\frac{W_0}{2\pi}}\,\left(\frac{g_s}{2\pi}\right)^{1/4}\,\sqrt{\frac{m_{3/2}}{M_p}}\simeq 0.126 \qquad\text{and}\qquad \alpha_2 = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
If we set $\phi=\phi_0 + \hat\phi_{\rm he} \simeq 6.71$, the ratio in (\ref{KKratio}) becomes $m_{3/2}/M_\KK^{(2)} \simeq 0.87$, and so the KK scale $M_\KK^{(2)}$ is always larger than the gravitino mass throughout all the inflationary dynamics. This result seems to be more in agreement with the swampland conjecture of \cite{Klaewer:2016kiy, Blumenhagen:2017cxt} than the one of case $1$ since $r$ is smaller, $r\simeq 0.001$, and the field range is slightly reduced, $\Delta \hat\phi\simeq 4$. Moreover larger values of $\phi$ would bring the effective field theory approach out of control. 

Even if this example satisfies all consistency and phenomenological constraints and the single-field inflationary analysis is under control, in Sec. \ref{Multi} we shall perform a more precise multifield analysis where the motion along the orthogonal directions enlarges the field space as well as the allowed number of efoldings.


\subsection{Multi-field evolution}
\label{Multi}

The following five consistency conditions require generically a multi-field study of the inflationary evolution (which might however still be mainly along a single direction in field space):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The whole inflationary dynamics takes place well inside the K\"ahler cone described by the conditions in (\ref{KCA});

\item The quantum fluctuations of the inflaton produce a correct amplitude of the density perturbations at horizon exit;

\item The directions orthogonal to the inflaton are not destabilised by the inflationary dynamics. This is guaranteed if inflation occurs in field space along a through which can however bend;

\item Throughout all the inflationary dynamics, no Kaluza-Klein scale becomes smaller than the gravitino mass;

\item The steepening of the inflationary potential due to $F^4$ corrections is negligible, so that enough efoldings can be obtained before destroying slow roll inflation.
\end{enumerate}
If ${V}\sim 10^3$ and $W_0\sim {O}(1)$, the last four conditions can be easily satisfied but the K\"ahler cone conditions (\ref{KCA}) for such a small value of the volume would give an upper bound on the inflaton direction which would not allow to generate enough efoldings. In order to enlarge the inflaton field space, the value of the volume has therefore to be larger, of order ${V} \sim 10^4$. In the large volume regime where we can trust the 4D EFT, the inflationary potential then becomes more suppressed, and so the COBE normalisation condition (2) above can be satisfied only if $W_0\sim {O}(100)$. However, given that the gravitino mass is proportional to $W_0$, for such a large value of the flux-generated superpotential, it is hard to satisfty the fourth condition above keeping $m_{3/2}$ below all KK scales during the whole inflationary evolution. Moreover, it becomes harder to suppress higher derivative corrections (condition (5) above) unless their numerical coefficient $\lambda$ turns out to be extremely small: $|\lambda|\lesssim 10^{-6}$. This is the example of case 2 above of Sec. \ref{GoodCase}.

Another option for ${V} \sim 10^4$ could be to keep $W_0\sim {O}(1)$, so that the gravitino mass can remain small and the $F^4$ terms are still negligible, and to tune the background fluxes to increase the complex structure-dependent coefficients of the winding loop corrections. This would however 
make the inflaton-dependent potential of the same order of magnitude of the leading order $\alpha'$ correction. Hence the mass of the volume mode becomes of order the Hubble scale during inflation. This is the example of case 1 of Sec. \ref{BadCase} where $\delta \simeq 1.6$. This situation could either cause a considerable shift of the original LVS minimum or even a destabilisation, and so in this case one should perform a careful multi-field analysis to check that the condition (3) above is indeed satisfied.\footnote{A similar situation arises in K\"ahler moduli inflation where however a detailed multifield analysis shows that the minimum of the volume mode is shifted during inflation without developing a runaway direction \cite{Cicoli:2017shd, BlancoPillado:2009nw}.}

In what follows we shall therefore focus on the multifield case with ${V}\sim 10^4$, $W_0\sim {O}(100)$ and $|\lambda|\lesssim 10^{-6}$. We shall also present an example with $W_0\sim {O}(1)$ and $|\lambda| \sim 10^{-3}$ which satisfies all conditions above except for condition (2) since the amplitude of the density perturbations turns out to be too small. The correct value could be generated by the quantum fluctuations of the two light bulk axions which could play the r\^ole of curvaton fields \cite{curvaton}. This study is however beyond the scope of this paper, and so we leave it for future work. 

We analyse now the full three-field cosmological evolution involving the K\"ahler moduli $\tau_7$, ${V}$ and $\tau_1$. Their dynamics is governed by the 
following evolution equations for non-canonically normalised fields:
\begin{equation}
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{c}
 \ddot{\phi}^{i}+3H\dot{\phi}^{i}
 +\Gamma_{jk}^{i}\dot{\phi}^{j}\dot{ \phi}^k+g^{ij}\frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi ^j}=0, \\
 H^2=\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2=\frac13 \left(\frac12 g_{ij}\dot{\phi}^i\dot{\phi}^j+V \right),
 \end{array}
 \right.
\end{equation}
where the $\phi_i$'s represent the scalar fields $\tau_7$, ${V}$ and $\tau_1$, $a$ is the scale factor and $\Gamma_{jk}^{i}$ are the target space Christoffel symbols using the metric $g_{ij}$ for the set of real scalars $\phi^i$ such that $\frac{\partial^2 K}{\partial \Phi^I
\partial \Phi^{*J}} \,\partial^{\mu}\Phi^I\partial_{\mu}\Phi^{*J} =\frac12\,g_{ij}\partial_{\mu}\phi^i\partial^{\mu}\phi^j$.

For numerical purposes it is more convenient to express the cosmological evolution of the fields as a function of the number of efoldings $N$ rather than time. In fact, by using $a(t)=e^N$ and $\frac{d}{dt}=H\frac{d}{dN}$, we can directly obtain $\tau_7 (N)$, ${V}(N)$ and $\tau_1(N)$ without having to solve for the scale factor. The equations of motion turn out to be (with $'$ denoting a derivative with respect to $N$):
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_7^{\prime \prime } &=&-\left( {L}_{\rm kin}+3\right) \left(\tau_7^\prime +\tau_7{V} \frac{V_{,{V}}}{V}+2\tau_7^2 \frac{V_{,\tau_7}}{V}+2\tau_7\tau_1 \frac{V_{,\tau_1}}{V}\right) +\frac{\tau_7^{\prime 2}}{\tau_7}
+\frac{\tau_7 \tau_1^\prime}{{V}}\left(\frac{\tau_1^{\prime}}{\sqrt{\tau_1}} -\frac{\tau_7^\prime}{2\sqrt{\tau_7}}  \right)
\,, \nonumber\\ \\
 {V}^{\prime \prime } &=&-\left( {L}_{\rm kin}+3\right) \left( {V}^\prime +\frac{3{V}^2}{2}\frac{V_{,{V}}}{V}+\tau_7{V}\frac{V_{,\tau_7}}{V}+\tau_1{V}\frac{V_{,\tau_1}}{V}\right)
 +\frac{{V}^{\prime 2}}{{V}}\,, 
\label{NLEq} \\
\tau_1^{\prime \prime } &=& -\left( {L}_{\rm kin}+3\right) \left(\tau_1^\prime +\tau_1{V}\frac{V_{,{V}}}{V}+ 2\tau_7\tau_1\,\frac{V_{,\tau_7}}{V}
+ 4{V}\sqrt{\tau_1}\,\frac{V_{,\tau_1}}{V}\right) \nonumber\\ \\
&+& \frac{\tau_1^{\prime \,2}}{4\tau_1}
+ \frac{\tau_1 {V}^\prime}{{V}} \left( \frac{\tau_1^\prime}{\tau_1} - \frac{\tau_7^\prime}{\tau_7} \right) 
+\frac{\tau_1 \tau_7^\prime}{2\tau_7} \left(\frac{3 \tau_7^{\prime}}{2 \tau_7}
-\frac{\sqrt{\tau_1}}{{V}} \tau_1^\prime\right) \,,  \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
where the kinetic Lagrangian reads:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac12 \left(-\frac{{V}^{\prime\,2}}{{V}^2} + \frac{{V}^\prime \tau_7^\prime}{{V} \tau_7 } - \frac{3 \tau_7^{\prime\,2}}{4 \tau_7^2} + \frac{\sqrt{\tau_1} \tau_7^\prime \tau_1^\prime}{ 2 {V} \tau_7} - \frac{\tau_1^{\prime\, 2}}{ 4 {V} \sqrt{\tau_1}}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and the full inflationary potential $V$ is given by the sum of the standard LVS potential, the $g_s$ loops and $F^4$ terms given in (\ref{exA_tot_pot}) and an uplifting contribution proportional to $\delta_{\rm up}$ which could come from an anti D3-brane at the tip of a warped throat:
\begin{eqnarray}
V &=& \kappa \left[32 A_s^2 \pi^2\,\frac{\sqrt{\tau_1}}{{V}}\,e^{-4\pi\tau_1} - 8\pi A_s \frac{W_0 \tau_1}{{V}^2}\,e^{-2\pi\tau_1} + \frac{3\zeta}{4 g_s^{3/2}} \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3} \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&+& \left.  \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\,\left(\frac{A_1}{\tau_7}-\frac{A_2}{\sqrt{\tau_7}}  + \frac{B_1\sqrt{\tau_7}}{{V}}+\frac{B_2 \,\tau_7}{{V}}\right)+\frac{\delta_{\rm up}}{{V}^{4/3}}\right]\,.
\label{Vinf}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{$|\lambda| = 10^{-6}$ and correct amplitude of the density perturbations}
\label{GreatCase}

Setting $\alpha=1$ and performing the following choice of the underlying parameters:
\begin{eqnarray}
A_s &=& 6\cdot 10^5 \qquad \chi=-188 \quad\Rightarrow \quad \zeta = -\frac{\zeta(3) \chi(X)}{2 (2\pi)^3} = 0.456 \quad W_0 = 50 \quad g_s = 0.25 \nonumber\\ \\
C_1^\W &=& C_2^\W = 0.05 \quad |C_3^\W| = 10^{-4} \quad |C_4^\W| = 0.1 \quad C_5^\W=C_6^\W = -0.05 \quad \lambda = -10^{-6}\,, \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
the total potential (\ref{Vinf}) admits a Minkowski global minimum at:
\begin{equation}
\langle {V}\rangle = 2690.625\,,\qquad \langle\tau_7\rangle = 6.503\,\qquad \langle \tau_1\rangle = 3.179\quad\text{for}\quad 
\delta_{\rm up} = 5.9598\cdot 10^{-4}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Notice that this minimum is inside the K\"ahler cone since $\langle\tau_7\rangle > 2\langle\tau_1\rangle = 6.358$, which respects the lower bound in (\ref{KCA}). At this level of approximation, the closed string axions associated to ${V}$ and $\tau_7$ are flat directions. They receive a tiny potential from highly suppressed non-perturbative effects, and so they remain very light. Being so light, they do not affect the inflationary dynamics but would acquire isocurvature fluctuations of order $H$ during inflation. If they do not play the r\^ole of dark matter, their final contribution to the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbations is negligible. On the other hand, if they are heavy enough to decay, their isocurvature fluctuations get converted into standard density perturbations, and so these bulk axions could behave as curvaton fields \cite{curvaton}.

Let us now shift $\tau_7$ away from its minimum at the initial condition $\tau_7 (N=0) = \langle\tau_7\rangle + 2030$ and recompute the new minimum for the other two directions $\langle {V}\rangle(\tau_7)$ and $\langle\tau_1\rangle(\tau_7)$. These values would set the initial conditions for these fields, ensuring that the inflationary dynamics takes place along a stable trough in field space:
\begin{equation}
{V}(0) = \langle {V}\rangle (\tau_7(0)) = 3671.432\,,\quad \tau_7(0) = 2036.503\,,
\quad\tau_1(0) = \langle \tau_1\rangle(\tau_7(0)) = 3.227 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Notice that these initial conditions are again inside the K\"ahler cone since $\tau_7(0) < \frac{{V}(0)}{\sqrt{\tau_1(0)}} = 2043.7$, which satisfies the upper bound in (\ref{KCA}). We shall also focus on vanishing initial velocities for all scalar fields: ${V}^\prime (0) = \tau_7^\prime (0) = \tau_1^\prime(0) = 0$.

Considering this set of initial conditions, we solved the system of equations of motion (\ref{NLEq}) finding the cosmological evolution of each scalar field as a function of the number of efoldings $N$. Inflation occurs in the region in field space where the generalised $\epsilon$-parameter:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon (N) =-\frac{1}{4{L}_{\rm kin} V^2}\left(V_{,{V}}\,{V}^\prime+V_{,\tau_7}\,\tau_7^\prime+V_{,\tau_1}\,\tau_1^\prime\right)^2\,,
\label{GenEps}
\end{equation}
is much smaller than unity. As can be seen from Fig. \ref{FigEps}, $\epsilon\ll 1$ during the first $57$ efoldings and then quickly increases and reaches $\epsilon = 1$ at $N=57.93$ where inflation ends. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Evolution of the $\epsilon$-parameter as a function of the number of efoldings $N$ for (left) the entire inflationary dynamics and (right) for the last efolding.}
\label{FigEps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Using the variable $N$ to parametrise the cosmological evolution of the scalar fields and denoting by $N_e$ the physical number of efoldings of inflation, $N_e = 52$, as estimated in Sec. \ref{exA_inf}, at $N_* = 5.93$. This is the point of horizon exit in field space where $\epsilon (N_*) = 1.456\cdot 10^{-4}$ which yields a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 16 \epsilon(N_*) = 0.0023$. The amplitude of the scalar power spectrum is:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{P(N_*)} = \frac{1}{10\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2\,V(N_*)}{3\,\epsilon(N_*)}} = 1.035 \cdot 10^{-5}\,,
\end{equation}
reproducing the reference COBE value $\sqrt{P_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm COBE}}}\simeq 2\cdot 10^{-5}$ with a good accuracy. Moreover the scalar spectral index is given by:
\begin{equation}
n_s (N_*) = 1 + \left.\frac{d}{dN}\,\ln P(N)\right|_{N=N_*} = 0.9701\,,
\end{equation}
in good agreement with Planck data \cite{Ade:2015lrj, Ade:2015xua}. 

Fig. \ref{Figtau7}, \ref{FigVol} and \ref{Figtau1} show the cosmological evolution of the three scalar fields $\tau_7$, ${V}$ and $\tau_1$ during the whole inflationary dynamics and their final settling into the global minimum after a few oscillations. Fig. \ref{FigParam} shows instead the path of the inflationary trajectory in the $(\tau_7, {V})$-plane (on the left) and in the $(\tau_7, \tau_1)$-plane (on the right). Clearly, as expected from the single-field analysis of Sec. \ref{exA_inf}, the inflaton travels mainly along the $\tau_7$-direction. 

Finally Fig. \ref{FigKK} presents a plot with the cosmological evolution of all KK mass scales, the inflationary scale $M_{\rm inf} = V^{1/4}$ and the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ from horizon exit to the final settling into the global minimum. The fact that $M_{\rm inf}$ remains always below all the KK scales, ensures that the Hubble scale during inflation $H = \frac{M_{\rm inf}}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{M_{\rm inf}}{M_p}\right) < M_{\rm inf}$ is also always below each KK scale. The gravitino mass also remains always smaller than $M_\KK^{(i)}$ $\forall i$. This guarantees that the 4D effective field theory is under control. In particular, $M_\KK^{(2)}$, $M_\KK^{(6)}$ and the inflationary scale evolve from $M_\KK^{(2)}(N_*)\simeq 1.1\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV, $M_\KK^{(6)}(N_*)\simeq 2.1\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV and $M_{\rm inf}(N_*)\simeq 5.3\cdot 10^{15}$ GeV at horizon exit to $M_\KK^{(2)}(N=60)\simeq 6.2\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV, $M_\KK^{(6)}(N=60)\simeq 1.3\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV and $M_{\rm inf}(N=60)\simeq 9.3\cdot 10^{14}$ GeV around the final minimum. On the other hand the other scales remain approximately constant during the whole inflationary evolution around: $H\simeq 5\cdot 10^{12}\,{\rm GeV} < m_{3/2}\simeq 4\cdot 10^{15}\,{\rm GeV} < M_\KK^{\rm bulk}\simeq 2\cdot 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}$.

\subsubsection{$|\lambda| = 10^{-3}$ and negligible amplitude of the density perturbations}
\label{NoCobeCase}

We shall now relax the condition of generating the correct amplitude of the density perturbations from the inflaton quantum fluctuations. As explained above, the right COBE value of the amplitude of the power spectrum could instead be reproduced in a non-standard way by a curvaton-like mechanism involving the quantum fluctuations of the two light bulk axions \cite{curvaton}. In this case we can focus on ${V}\sim 5\cdot 10^3$, $W_0\sim{O}(1)$, $\lambda\sim 10^{-3}$ and relatively small values of the coefficients of the winding loop corrections which generate the plateau, so that all the remaining four conditions listed at the beginning of Sec. \ref{Multi} are fully satisfied. 

We shall set $\alpha=1$ and perform the following choice of the underlying parameters:
\begin{eqnarray}
A_s &=& 1\cdot 10^4 \qquad \chi=-188 \quad\Rightarrow \quad \zeta = -\frac{\zeta(3) \chi(X)}{2 (2\pi)^3} = 0.455 \quad W_0 = 1 \quad g_s = 0.25 \nonumber\\ \\
C_1^\W &=& C_2^\W = 0.05 \quad C_3^\W = -10^{-4} \quad C_4^\W = -0.1 \quad C_5^\W=C_6^\W = -0.05 \quad \lambda = -0.001\,, \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
which yield a global Minkowski minimum inside the K\"ahler cone at:
\begin{equation}
\langle {V}\rangle = 3220.899\,,\qquad \langle\tau_7\rangle = 6.403\,\qquad \langle \tau_1\rangle = 3.179\quad\text{for}\quad 
\delta_{\rm up} = 1.76588\cdot 10^{-7}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
The initial conditions for the inflationary evolution are again derived in the same way: the fibre modulus $\tau_7$ is shifted away from its minimum at $\tau_7 (N=0) = \langle\tau_7\rangle + 2450$ and the other two directions $\langle {V}\rangle(\tau_7)$ and $\langle\tau_1\rangle(\tau_7)$ are set at the new minimum:
\begin{equation}
{V}(0) = \langle {V}\rangle (\tau_7(0)) = 4436.094\,,\quad \tau_7(0) = 2456.403\,,
\quad\tau_1(0) = \langle \tau_1\rangle(\tau_7(0)) = 3.228 \,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Notice that these initial conditions are inside the K\"ahler cone since $\tau_7(0) < \frac{{V}(0)}{\sqrt{\tau_1(0)}} = 2468.95$, which satisfies the upper bound in (\ref{KCA}). Focusing again on vanishing initial velocities for all scalar fields, i.e. ${V}^\prime (0) = \tau_7^\prime (0) = \tau_1^\prime(0) = 0$, we worked out the cosmological evolution of each scalar field as a function of $N$ by solving the system of equations of motion (\ref{NLEq}). Looking for a slow-roll region in field space where the generalised $\epsilon$-parameter (\ref{GenEps}) is much smaller than unity, we found that $\epsilon\ll 1$ during the first $69$ efoldings and then quickly increases and reaches $\epsilon = 1$ at $N=69.15$ where inflation ends. The point of horizon exit corresponding to a physical number of efoldings of inflation $N_e = 52$ is localised at $N_* = 17.15$ where $\epsilon (N_*) = 1.36\cdot 10^{-4}$. The main cosmological observables at horizon exit take the following values:
\begin{eqnarray}
n_s (N_*) &=& 1 + \left.\frac{d}{dN}\,\ln P(N)\right|_{N=N_*} = 0.9676\,, \qquad r = 16 \epsilon(N_*) = 0.0022\,, \nonumber\\ \\
\sqrt{P(N_*)} &=& \frac{1}{10\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2\,V(N_*)}{3\,\epsilon(N_*)}} = 1.64 \cdot 10^{-7}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
The scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are in good agreement with Planck data \cite{Ade:2015lrj, Ade:2015xua} while the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum, as expected, is much smaller than the reference COBE value $\sqrt{P_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm COBE}}}\simeq 2\cdot 10^{-5}$. As can be seen from Fig. \ref{FigKK2}, in this case the low-energy 4D effective field theory is fully under control since throughout all the inflationary evolution all KK scales are much higher than both the gravitino mass and the inflationary scale (and so also the Hubble scale).

\caption{Evolution of all KK masses (with $M_\KK^{(4)}=M_\KK^{(2)}$), the inflationary scale $M_{\rm inf} = V^{1/4}$ and the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ in GeV units from horizon exit to the final settling into the global minimum.}
\label{FigKK2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In particular, $M_\KK^{(2)}$, $M_\KK^{(6)}$ and the inflationary scale evolve from $M_\KK^{(2)}(N_*)\simeq 9.8\cdot 10^{15}$ GeV, $M_\KK^{(6)}(N_*)\simeq 1.8\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV and $M_{\rm inf}(N_*)\simeq 6.5\cdot 10^{14}$ GeV at horizon exit to $M_\KK^{(2)}(N=70)\simeq 5.5\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV, $M_\KK^{(6)}(N=70)\simeq 1.2\cdot 10^{16}$ GeV and $M_{\rm inf}(N=70)\simeq 1.4\cdot 10^{14}$ GeV around the final minimum. On the other hand the other scales remain approximately constant during the whole inflationary evolution around: $H\simeq 8\cdot 10^{11}\,{\rm GeV} < m_{3/2}\simeq 6\cdot 10^{13}\,{\rm GeV} < M_\KK^{\rm bulk}\simeq 2\cdot 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}$.



\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

The study of large field inflationary models is particularly interesting from both a phenomenological and a theoretical point of view. In fact, from one side the next generation of CMB observations will be able to test values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the window $0.001\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$, while on the other hand trans-Planckian inflaton excursions need a symmetry mechanism to trust the effective field theory approach. 

Natural inflaton candidates from type IIB string compactifications are K\"ahler moduli which enjoy non-compact shift-symmetries \cite{Burgess:2014tja}. In particular, fibre inflation models provide promising plateau-like potentials which seem to fit Planck data rather well and lead to the prediction of observable tensor modes \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Broy:2015zba, Cicoli:2016chb, Burgess:2016owb}. These inflationary models are built within LVS moduli stabilisation scenarios and can be globally embedded in K3-fibred Calabi-Yau manifolds \cite{Cicoli:2016xae}. 

In this paper we extended previous work by constructing the first explicit realisations of fibre inflation models in concrete type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds with consistent brane setups, full closed string moduli fixing and chiral matter on D7-branes. The underlying compactification manifold features $h^{1,1}=4$ K\"ahler moduli which after D-term stabilisation get effectively reduced to the standard $3$ moduli of fibre inflation models. 

We found that the inflationary dynamics is strongly constrained by the K\"ahler cone conditions which never allow for enough efoldings of inflation if the internal volume is of order ${V} \sim 10^3$. For larger values of the Calabi-Yau volume of order ${V}\sim 10^4$, the K\"ahler cone becomes large enough for the inflaton to drive $N_e\simeq 52$ efoldings, as required by an estimate of the post-inflationary evolution. However such a large value of ${V}$ tends to suppress the amplitude of the density perturbations below the reference COBE value. This can be avoided by considering large values of either the coefficients of the winding loops which generate the plateau, or the flux superpotential $W_0$. Let us stress that in the string landscape this choice is guaranteed to be possible by the fact that both of these microscopic parameters are flux-dependent.

However, as shown in Sec. \ref{BadCase}, large values of the coefficients of the winding $g_s$ corrections make the Hubble scale during inflation of the same order of magnitude of the mass of the volume mode. This could either cause a large shift of the original LVS minimum or even a problem for the stability of the inflationary direction against orthogonal runaway directions. A definite answer to this issue hence requires a proper multi-field analysis even if the two-field study of \cite{Cicoli:2008gp} revealed that the inflationary motion is still mostly single-field. 

On the other hand, if the flux superpotential is of order $W_0\sim 100$, the gravitino mass can become too close to some KK scale in the model, destroying the 4D effective field theory. Moreover, $F^4$ terms are proportional to $|\lambda| W_0^4$. Thus if $W_0$ is large, these higher derivative effects can spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential before achieving enough efoldings of inflation if $|\lambda|$ is not small enough. Hence in Sec. \ref{GoodCase} we presented a model with $W_0\sim 100$ and a very small value of $|\lambda|$ of order $|\lambda|=10^{-7}$ which makes the $F^4$ terms harmless. The gravitino mass also turns out to be slightly smaller than any KK scale throughout the whole inflationary dynamics. 

Due to the fact that in the single-field case not all our approximations are fully under control, in Sec. \ref{Multi} we performed a complete numerical analysis of the $3$-field cosmological evolution. For $W_0\sim 100$ and $|\lambda|=10^{-6}$, the multi-field analysis of Sec. \ref{GreatCase} revealed that the accuracy of our approximations improves. In particular, the allowed number of efoldings of inflation increases due to the extra motion along the volume and blow-up directions. Hence inflation can successfully work also for smaller values of ${V}$ which cause a smaller K\"ahler cone for the fibre modulus. This, in turn, requires smaller values of $W_0$ to match the COBE normalisation of the density perturbations, which enlarges the hierarchy between $m_{3/2}$ and the KK scales in the model. 

We point out however that some of the underlying parameters are not flux-dependent, and so are not tunable in the string landscape. Two examples of this kind of parameters are the effective Euler number $\chi_{\rm eff}$ which controls the strength of ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ corrections due to O7-planes \cite{Minasian:2015bxa} and the combinatorial factor $\lambda$ which is the coefficient of ${O}(\alpha'^3)$ higher derivatives \cite{Ciupke:2015msa}. Both of these microscopic parameters have not been computed in full detail yet, even if $\lambda$ has been estimated to be of order $10^{-3}$ \cite{Grimm:2017okk}. Hence in Sec. \ref{NoCobeCase} we also presented a case with $|\lambda|=0.001$ where it is hard to obtain enough efoldings inside the K\"ahler cone and generate, at the same time, the correct amplitude of the density perturbations in a framework where all the approximations are fully under control. Hence we chose the flux superpotential so that the contribution of the inflaton quantum fluctuations to the scalar power spectrum is negligible. In this case a viable inflationary phenomenology can therefore be achieved only in the presence of a non-standard mechanism for the generation of the density perturbations. A promising case could be the curvaton scenario where the initial isocurvature fluctuations could be produced by the quantum oscillations of the two light bulk closed string axions \cite{curvaton}. 

Besides a complete computation of the exact value of both $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\lambda$, and the detailed derivation of a curvaton-like mechanism, there are several other important open issues for future work. A crucial one is a better determination of the actual Calabi-Yau K\"ahler cone since the one that we used is just an approximation inherited from the Mori cone of the ambient toric variety. It would also be interesting to develop a more systematic study of the constraints that the K\"ahler cone sets on the inflationary dynamics by performing a complete scan over all $h^{1,1}=3$ and $h^{1,1}=4$ K3 fibred CY threefolds with at least a del Pezzo divisor \cite{Cicoli:2018tcq}. Moreover our chiral global models still lack an explicit implementation of a mechanism responsible for the realisation of a dS vacuum. Finally, the study of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution of our universe is of primary importance in order to discriminate among different models that feature the same inflationary predictions of fibre inflation models. A first step forward towards understanding (p-)reheating has been taken in \cite{Cabella:2017zsa, Antusch:2017flz}. A full understanding of this mechanism requires further investigation of the underlying microscopic dynamics.

\section{Another chiral global example}
\label{ExB}

\subsection{Toric data}

Let us consider the following toric data for a CY threefold with $h^{1,1}=4$ which is a K3-fibration over a ${P}^1$ base along with a so-called `small' divisor:

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|cccccccc|}
\hline
     & $x_1$  & $x_2$  & $x_3$  & $x_4$  & $x_5$ & $x_6$  & $x_7$ & $x_8$   \\
    \hline
 8 & 0 & 0  & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  & 4   \\
 6 & 0 & 0 &  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1  & 3   \\
 6 & 0 & 1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1  & 3   \\   
 4 & 1 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 2   \\   
 \hline
    & dP$_5$ &NdP$_{11}$  &  NdP$_{11}$ & dP$_7$ & K3 & K3 & SD1 & SD2 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{table}
 \noindent
with Hodge numbers $(h^{2,1}, h^{1,1}) = (106, 4)$ and Euler number $\chi=-204$.
The Stanley-Reisner ideal is:
\begin{equation}
{\rm SR} = \{x_1 x_4, \, x_1 x_7, x_3 x_5, \, x_4 x_5, \, x_2 x_3 x_7, \, x_2 x_6 x_8,\, x_4 x_6 x_8\}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the CY threefold used in \cite{Cicoli:2011qg} to build global models with chiral matter on D7-branes and K\"ahler moduli stabilisation but without any inflationary dynamics. A detailed divisor analysis using \texttt{cohomCalg} \cite{Blumenhagen:2010pv, Blumenhagen:2011xn} shows that the divisor $D_4$ is a del Pezzo dP$_7$ which we find to be shrinkable after investigating the CY volume form. Further, each of the divisors $\{D_2, \, D_3\}$ are non-diagonal del Pezzo surfaces and $\{D_5, \, D_6\}$ are two K3 surfaces while the divisors $\{D_7, \, D_8\}$ are two `special deformation' divisors with Hodge diamond:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm SD1} \equiv
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  3 & & 38 & & 3 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \qquad \qquad\text{and}\qquad\qquad
		{\rm SD2} \equiv
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    & & 1 & & \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
  25 & & 172 & & 25 \\
   & 0 & & 0 & \\
    & & 1 & & \\
  \end{tabular} \nonumber\\
	\end{eqnarray}
The intersection form in the basis of smooth divisors $\{D_1, D_4, D_5, D_6\}$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
I_3= 2 \, D_1 \, D_5 \, D_6 - 2\, D_1^2\,D_5 - 2\, D_1^2\, D_6+ 2\, D_4^3+  4 \, D_1^3\,.
\label{I3B}
\end{equation}
Writing the K\"ahler form in the above basis of divisors as $J=t_1\, D_1 + t_4\, D_4 + t_5 \, D_5+ t_6\, D_6$  and using the intersection
polynomial (\ref{I3B}), the CY overall volume takes the form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = 2\, t_1 \, t_5\, t_6  - t_1^2\, t_5 - t_1^2\, t_6 + \frac{t_4^3}{3} +\frac23\, t_1^3\,.
\end{equation}
In order to express ${V}$ in terms of four-cycle moduli, we need to know the K\"ahler cone conditions which can be determined from the following K\"ahler cone generators:
\begin{equation}
K_1 = D_1 + D_5 +D_6, \quad K_2 = D_1 - D_4 + D_5 +D_6, \quad K_3 = D_5, \quad K_4 = D_6\,.
\end{equation}
Expanding the K\"ahler form $J$ in these K\"ahler cone generators as $J=\sum_{i=1}^4 r_i\, K_i$ results in the following conditions for the two-cycle moduli:
\begin{equation}
r_1 = t_1 + t_4 >0\,, \qquad r_2 = - t_4 > 0\,, \qquad  r_3 = t_5- t_1 >0\,,  \qquad r_4 = t_6 - t_1>0\,.
\label{KCone}
\end{equation}
Using the four-cycle moduli, $\tau_i = \partial_{t_i}{V}$, given by:
\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = 2\,(t_5- t_1)(t_6-t_1), \quad \tau_4 =  t_4^2, \quad \tau_5 = t_1(2\,t_6- t_1), \quad \tau_6 = t_1(2\,t_5-t_1)\,,
\end{equation}
the overall volume can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \frac13\left(t_1\tau_1 + t_5\tau_5+ t_6\tau_6- \tau_4^{3/2}\right)\,.
\label{VolB}
\end{equation}
The second Chern class of the CY threefold $X$ is instead given by:
\begin{equation}
c_2(X) = 2 \, D_6 \, D_8 + 8\, D_7\, D_8 - 2 \, D_6^2 - 4\, D_6\, D_7 - 12\, D_7^2\,,
\end{equation}
which results in the following values of the topological quantities $\Pi_i$'s:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_1 = 4, \quad \Pi_2 = \Pi_3 =16, \quad \Pi_4 =8, \quad \Pi_5 =\Pi_6 =24, \quad \Pi_7 =44, \quad\Pi_8 =136\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
The intersection curves between two coordinate divisors are given in Tab. \ref{TabIntB} while their volumes are listed in Tab. \ref{IntersectB}.

\subsection{Orientifold involution}

We focus on orientifold involutions of the form $\sigma: x_i \to - x_i$ with $i = 1, ...,8$  which feature an O7-plane on $D_i$ and O3-planes at the fixed points listed in Tab. \ref{FixedPointsB}. The effective non-trivial fixed point set in Tab. \ref{FixedPointsB} has been obtained after taking care of
the SR ideal symmetry. Moreover, the total number of O3-planes $N_{\rm O3}$ is obtained from the triple intersections restricted to the CY hypersurface, while the effective Euler number $\chi_{\rm eff}$ has been computed as:
\begin{equation}
\chi_{\rm eff} = \chi(X) +2\int_X [{\rm O7}] \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge [{\rm O7}]\,.
\end{equation}
In what follows we shall focus on the orientifold involution $\sigma: x_7\rightarrow-x_7$ which features two non-intersecting O7-planes located in $D_1$ and $D_7$ and two O3-planes at $\{D_2D_3D_4\}$\,.

\subsection{Brane setup}

If the D7-tadpole cancellation condition is satisfied by placing four D7-branes on top of the O7-plane, the string loop corrections to the scalar potential involve only KK effects since winding contributions are absent due to the absence of any intersection between D7-branes and/or O7-planes. Thus loop effects are too simple to generate a viable inflationary plateau. We shall therefore focus on a slightly more complicate D7-brane setup which gives rise also to winding loop effects. This can be achieved by placing D7-branes not entirely on top of the O7-plane as follows:  
\begin{equation}
8[{\rm O7}] \equiv 8([D_1]+[D_7]) =8 \left(2[D_1] + [D_2]+[D_5] \right)\,.
\end{equation}
This brane setup involves three stacks of D7-branes wrapped around the divisors $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_5$. Moreover, the condition for D3-tadpole cancellation becomes:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm D3} + \frac{N_{\rm flux}}{2} + N_{\rm gauge} = \frac{N_{\rm O3}}{4} + \frac{\chi({\rm O7})}{12} + \sum_a\, \frac{N_a \left(\chi(D_a) + \chi(D_a^\prime) \right) }{48}  = 14 \,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
showing that there is space for turning on both gauge and background three-form fluxes for complex structure and dilaton stabilisation.

\subsection{Gauge fluxes}

In order to obtain a chiral visible sector on the D7-brane stacks wrapping $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_5$ we need to turn on worldvolume gauge fluxes of the form:
\begin{equation}
\F_i = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{ij}\hat{D}_j + \frac12 \hat{D}_i - \iota_{D_i}^*B \quad\text{with}\quad f_{ij}\in \mathbb{Z} \quad\text{and}\quad i=1,2,5\,,
\end{equation}
where the half-integer contribution is due to Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation \cite{Minasian:1997mm, Freed:1999vc}. 

However we want to generate just one moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term in order to fix only one K\"ahler modulus via D-term stabilisation. In fact, if the number of FI-terms is larger than one, there is no light K\"ahler modulus which can play the r\^ole of the inflaton. Moreover we wrap a D3-brane instanton on the rigid divisor $D_4$ in order to generate a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential which is crucial for LVS moduli stabilisation. In order to cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly, the D3-instanton has to support a half-integer flux, and so the general expression of the total gauge flux on $D_4$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
\F_4 = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{4j}\hat{D}_j + \frac12 \hat{D}_4 - \iota_{D_i}^*B \quad\text{with}\quad f_{4j}\in \mathbb{Z}\,.
\end{equation}
However a non-vanishing $\F_4$ would not be gauge invariant, and so would prevent a non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential. We need therefore to check if it is possible to perform an appropriate choice of $B$-field which can simultaneously set $\F_1=\F_2=0$ (we choose to have a non-vanishing gauge flux only on $D_5$ to have just one moduli-dependent FI-term) and $\F_4=0$. If we set:
\begin{equation}
B = \frac12 \hat{D}_1 + \frac12 \hat{D}_2 + \frac12 \hat{D}_4\,,
\label{Bfield}
\end{equation}
the condition $\F_1=\F_2=\F_4=0$ reduces to the requirement that the following forms are integer:
\begin{equation}
\iota_{D_1}^* \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_2 + \frac12 \hat{D}_4 \right) \qquad 
\iota_{D_2}^* \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 + \frac12 \hat{D}_4 \right) \qquad
\iota_{D_4}^* \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 + \frac12 \hat{D}_2 \right)\,,
\label{Pullbacks}
\end{equation}
since in this case the integer flux quanta $f_{ij}$ can always be adjusted to yield vanishing gauge fluxes. 
Taking an arbitrary integer form $A\in H^2(\mathbb{Z},X)$ which can be expanded as $A=a_j\hat{D}_j$ with $a_j \in \mathbb{Z}$, the pullbacks in (\ref{Pullbacks}) give rise to integer forms if:
\begin{eqnarray}
b_1 &\equiv& \int_X \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_2 + \frac12 \hat{D}_4 \right) \wedge \hat{D}_1 \wedge A \in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\\ \\
b_2 &\equiv& \int_X \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 + \frac12 \hat{D}_4 \right) \wedge \hat{D}_2 \wedge A \in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\\ \\
b_4 &\equiv& \int_X \left(\frac12 \hat{D}_1 + \frac12 \hat{D}_2 \right) \wedge \hat{D}_4 \wedge A \in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
Using the intersection polynomial (\ref{I3B}) we find $b_1= a_5-a_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b_2 = b_1 -a_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b_4 = -a_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$, 
showing how the choice of $B$-field in (\ref{Bfield}) can indeed allow for $\F_1=\F_2=\F_4=0$. The only non-zero gauge flux is $\F_5$ which does not feature any half-integer contribution since $c_1(D_5)=0$ given that $D_5$ is a K3 surface. Given that all the intersection numbers are even, the pullback of the $B$-field on $D_5$ does also not generate an half-integer flux. We shall therefore consider a non-vanishing gauge flux on the worldvolume of $D_5$ of the form:
\begin{equation}
\F_5 = \sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} f_{5j}\hat{D}_j \quad\text{with}\quad f_{5j}\in \mathbb{Z}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{FI-term and chirality}

Given that the divisor $D_5$ is transversely invariant under the orientifold involution and it is wrapped by four D7-branes, it supports an $Sp(8)$ gauge group which is broken down to $U(4)=SU(4)\times U(1)$ by a non-zero flux $\F_5$ along the diagonal $U(1)$. This non-trivial gauge flux $\F_5$ induces also a $U(1)$-charge $q_{i5}$ for the $i$-th K\"ahler modulus of the form:
\begin{equation}
q_{i5} = \int_X \hat{D}_i \wedge \hat{D}_5 \wedge \F_5 \,.
\end{equation}
Thus $\F_5\neq 0$ yields:
\begin{equation}
q_{15} = 2 (f_{56} - f_{51}) \qquad q_{45} = q_{55} = 0 \qquad q_{65} = 2 f_{51}\,,
\end{equation}
together with a flux-dependent correction to the gauge kinetic function which looks like:
\begin{equation}
{\rm Re}(f_5)  = \alpha_5^{-1}=\frac{4\pi}{g_5^2}=\tau_5-h(\F_5) {\rm Re}(S)\,,
\end{equation}
where: 
\begin{equation}
h(\F_5) =\frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \F_5 \wedge \F_5 =\frac12\left(f_{51} q_{15} + f_{56} q_{65}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover a non-vanishing gauge flux $\F_5$ induces a moduli-dependent FI-term of the form:
\begin{equation}
\xi =\frac{1}{4\pi{V}}\int_X \hat{D}_5\wedge J\wedge\F_5=\frac{1}{4\pi{V}}\sum_{j=1}^{h^{1,1}} q_{j5}\,t_j
=\frac{1}{4\pi{V}} \left(q_{15}\,t_1+q_{65}\,t_6\right)\,.
\end{equation}
For vanishing open string VEVs (induced for example by non-tachyonic scalar masses), a leading-order supersymmetric stabilisation requires $\xi=0$ which implies:
\begin{equation}
t_6 = - \frac{q_{15}}{q_{65}}\,t_1= \left(1-\frac{f_{56}}{f_{51}}\right) \,t_1 \equiv \alpha\,t_1\,.
\label{Dfix}
\end{equation}
This $U(1)$ factor becomes massive via the St\"uckelberg mechanism and develops an ${O}(M_s)$ mass by eating up a linear combination of an open and a closed string axion which is mostly given by the open string mode. 

Besides breaking the worldvolume gauge group and inducing moduli-dependent FI-terms, non-trivial gauge fluxes on D7-branes generate also 4D chiral modes. In fact, open strings stretching between the D7-branes on $D_5$ and the O7-planes or the image branes give rise to the following zero-modes in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of $U(4)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
I_5^{(S)} &=& - \frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge \F_5 - \int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \hat{D}_5 \wedge \F_5 
= -\left(q_{15}+\frac{q_{65}}{2}\right), \\
I_5^{(A)} &=& \frac12 \int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge [{\rm O7}] \wedge \F_5 - \int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \hat{D}_5 \wedge \F_5 = - I_5^{(S)}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Due to the absence of worldvolume fluxes on the D7-branes wrapped around $D_1$ and $D_2$, the gauge groups supported by these two D7-stacks are respectively $SO(16)$ (since $D_1$ is an O7-locus) and $Sp(8)$ (since $D_2$ is transversely invariant) which are both unbroken. Thus open strings stretched between the D7-branes on $D_5$ and $D_1$ (or its image brane) give rise to chiral zero-modes in the bi-fundamental representation ($4$,$16$) of $U(4)$ and $SO(16)$ whose number is:
\begin{equation}
I_{51}=\int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \hat{D}_1 \wedge \F_5 = q_{15}\,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the number of 4D chiral zero-modes in the bi-fundamental representation ($4$,$8$) of $U(4)$ and $Sp(8)$ (corresponding to open strings stretching between the D7s on $D_5$ and $D_2$) is:
\begin{equation}
I_{52}=\int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \hat{D}_2 \wedge \F_5 = q_{65}\,.
\end{equation}
We need finally to check that there are no chiral intersections between the D7s on $D_5$ and the instanton on $D_4$ to make sure that the prefactor of the non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential is indeed non-zero. This is ensured by the fact that:
\begin{equation}
I_{54}=\int_X \hat{D}_5 \wedge \hat{D}_4 \wedge \F_5 = 0 \,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Inflationary potential}

Using the D-term fixing relation (\ref{Dfix}), the K\"ahler cone conditions (\ref{KCone}) simplify to $t_5>t_1>-t_4>0$ and $\alpha>1$. 
Moreover the CY volume (\ref{VolB}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \left(2\alpha-1\right) t_5 t_1^2 - \left(\alpha-\frac23 \right) t_1^3 + \frac{t_4^3}{3}=t_b \tau_f -\frac13 \,\tau_4^{3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
Given that this form is linear in $t_5$, the effective CY volume after D-term stabilisation looks like a K3 fibre $\tau_f$ over a ${P}^1$ base $t_b$ whose volumes are given by:
\begin{equation}
\tau_f = \tau_5 = \left(2\alpha-1\right)  t_1^2\qquad\text{and}\qquad t_b = t_5 - \frac{\left(\alpha-\frac23 \right)}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)}\, t_1\,.
\end{equation}
Notice that the K\"ahler cone condition $t_5>t_1$ can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\tau_f < \sigma(\alpha) \,{V}^{2/3}\,,
\label{KCc}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\alpha) \equiv \left(2\alpha-1\right)\left(\frac{3}{3\alpha-1}\right)^{2/3}\quad\text{with}\quad \alpha>1\,.
\end{equation}
In terms of the canonically normalised inflaton shifted from its minimum, the condition (\ref{KCc}) reads:
\begin{equation}
\tau_f = \langle\tau_f\rangle\,e^{2\hat\phi/\sqrt{3}} < \sigma\,{V}^{2/3}\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad
\hat\phi<\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\ln\left(\frac{\sigma}{\langle\tau_f\rangle}\,{V}^{2/3}\right).
\label{KCbound}
\end{equation}
Let us now focus on the inflationary potential. The winding loop corrections look like (with $\kappa=g_s/(8\pi)$ for $e^{K_{\rm cs}}=1$):
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\W=-\kappa\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^3}\frac{C_\W}{\sqrt{\tau_f}}\,,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
C_\W= \sqrt{2\alpha-1}\left(C_1^\W+ \frac{C_2^\W}{\alpha}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the KK loop corrections read (neglecting $\tau_4$-dependent terms which yield subdominant contributions):
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK = \kappa g_s^2\frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\sum_{i,j=1,5,6} C_i^\KK C_j^\KK K_{ij}\,.
\end{equation}
After substituting $t_6=\alpha t_1$, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
Z{V}^2\sum_{i,j} C_i^\KK C_j^\KK K_{ij} = a t_1^2 + C_5^2 t_5\left(t_5 - t_1\right) -(1-Z)\left(b t_1^2 + c t_1 t_5 + \frac{C_5^2}{2} t_5^2 \right),  \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{eqnarray}
a &=& C_1 \left(C_1+ C_5 + C_6\right) + C_5 \left(C_6+\frac{C_5}{2}\right) +C_6^2 \left(\alpha^2-\alpha+\frac12\right) \nonumber\\ \\
b &=& \alpha C_1 C_6 + \frac{\alpha^2}{2} C_6^2  + \frac{C_1^2}{2}
\qquad \qquad c = C_5\left( C_1 + \alpha C_6\right), \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
and:
\begin{equation}
Z= 1-\frac{2}{3 \alpha-1}\left(\frac{\tau_f}{\sigma\,{V}^{2/3}}\right)^{3/2}. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Notice that the K\"ahler cone conditions $\tau_f<\sigma\,{V}^{2/3}$ and $\alpha>1$ imply $0<Z<1$. 
This guarantees the absence of any singularity in the K\"ahler metric. Expressing the scalar potential in terms of the 4-cycle moduli, we end up with:
\begin{equation}
V_{g_s}^\KK = \kappa g_s^2\frac{W_0^2}{Z{V}^2} \left[\frac{C_5^2}{\tau_f^2}  - \frac{2}{3\left(2\alpha-1\right)^{3/2}}\frac{C_5^2}{{V}\sqrt{\tau_f}}
+ d\,\frac{\tau_f}{{V}^2}\left(1 -h\, \frac{\tau_f^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)\right], 
\label{Vgskk}
\end{equation}
where $h=u/d$ with:
\begin{eqnarray}
d &=&  \frac{a}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)}
- \frac23 \frac{c}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)^2}
- \frac{C_5^2}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)^3}\left(\alpha^2-\frac{\alpha}{3}-\frac29\right) \nonumber\\ \\
u &=& \frac{2\,b}{3\left(2\alpha-1\right)^{5/2}} 
 +  \frac{2\,c}{3}\,\frac{\left(\alpha-\frac23 \right)}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)^{7/2}} 
+\frac{C_5^2}{3}\,\frac{\left(\alpha-\frac23 \right)^2}{\left(2\alpha-1\right)^{9/2}}\,. \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
If all the coefficients of the KK corrections take natural ${O}(1)$ values, the term in (\ref{Vgskk}) proportional to $h$ is suppressed by $h\ll1$, 
and so it can be safely neglected. 

On the other hand, higher derivative $\alpha'^3$ $F^4$ corrections take the form (neglecting the $t_4$-dependent term and setting $t_6=\alpha t_1$):
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4}=-4\kappa^2 \frac{\lambda W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}{V}^4}\left[(6\alpha+1) t_1+6t_5 \right]\,,
\end{equation}
which in terms of four-cycle moduli looks like:
\begin{equation}
V_{F^4}=-4\kappa^2 \frac{\lambda W_0^4}{g_s^{3/2}{V}^4}\left[ \frac{12\alpha^2+2\alpha-5}{(2\alpha-1)^{3/2}}
\sqrt{\tau_f}+ 6\frac{{V}}{\tau_f} \right].
\end{equation}
Therefore the total inflationary potential becomes:
\begin{equation}
V = V_{g_s}^\W+V_{g_s}^\KK + V_{F^4}  
= \kappa \frac{W_0^2}{{V}^2}\left(\frac{A_1}{\tau_f^2}+\frac{A_2}{{V}\tau_f}-\frac{A_3}{{V}\sqrt{\tau_f}}+\frac{B_1\,\sqrt{\tau_f}}{{V}^2}+\frac{B_2\,\tau_f}{{V}^2}\right),
\label{Vtot}
\end{equation}
where (with $\lambda=-|\lambda|<0$):
\begin{equation}
A_1=\frac{g_s^2}{Z}\,C_5^2\qquad 
A_2 = \frac{3}{\pi} \frac{|\lambda| W_0^2}{\sqrt{g_s}}
\qquad A_3= C_\W+ \frac{g_s^2}{Z}\frac{2\,C_5^2}{3\left(2\alpha-1\right)^{3/2}}\simeq C_\W
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
B_1 = \frac{12\alpha^2+2\alpha-5}{6(2\alpha-1)^{3/2}}\,A_2 \qquad B_2= \frac{g_s^2\,d}{Z} \,.
\end{equation}
The potential (\ref{Vtot}) could support single-field slow-roll inflation driven by $\tau_f$ \cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Cicoli:2016chb}. In order to get enough efoldings before hitting the walls of the K\"ahler cone given in (\ref{KCbound}), we need to focus on the region in field space where the inflaton minimum is of order $\langle\tau_f\rangle\ll {V}^{2/3}$. Numerical estimates show that we need values of order $\langle\tau_f\rangle \sim{O}(1)$ and ${V} \sim{O}(10^4)$ which, in turn, imply $W_0\sim{O}(100)$ in order to match the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. For $g_s\lesssim{O}(0.1)$, $|\lambda|\sim{O}(10^{-3})$ and natural ${O}(1)$ values of the coefficients of the string loop effects, the terms in (\ref{Vtot}) proportional to $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both negligible with respect to the first three terms in the vicinity of the minimum where $\tau_f\sim {O}(1)\ll{V}^{2/3}$. 

The scalar potential (\ref{Vtot}) written in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton $\phi = \langle \phi \rangle + \hat\phi$ looks like (with $k=2/\sqrt{3}$):
\begin{equation}
V = \kappa\,\frac{A_1 W_0^2}{\langle \tau_f \rangle^2 {V}^2} \left(C_\dS+ e^{-2 k \hat\phi}+\lambda_1 Z\,e^{-k\hat\phi}- \lambda_2 Z\,e^{-\frac{k \hat\phi}{2}} + {R}_1 Z\, e^{\frac{k \hat\phi}{2}}+ {R}_2\, e^{k \hat\phi}\right)\,,
\label{Vref}
\end{equation}
where we added a constant $C_\dS=\lambda_2 Z-\lambda_1 Z -1 - {R}_1 Z -{R}_2$ to obtain a Minkowski (or slightly dS) vacuum and:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_1 = \frac{3\langle\tau_f\rangle}{\pi C_5^2} \frac{|\lambda| W_0^2}{g_s^{5/2}\,{V}}\sim{O}(1-10)
\qquad \qquad\lambda_2 \simeq \frac{\langle\tau_f\rangle^{3/2}}{C_5^2} \frac{C_\W }{g_s^2\,{V}}\sim{O}(1-10)\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
while:
\begin{equation}
{R}_1 = \frac{12\alpha^2+2\alpha-5}{6(2\alpha-1)^{3/2}} \frac{\lambda_1\langle\tau_f\rangle^{3/2}}{{V}} \ll 1
\qquad\qquad
{R}_2 = \frac{\langle\tau_f\rangle^3}{C_5^2} \frac{d}{{V}^2} \ll 1\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
The three negative exponentials in (\ref{Vref}) compete to give a minimum at $\langle\tau_f\rangle \sim{O}(1)$ while the two positive exponentials cause a steepening behaviour at large $\hat\phi$. 

In this section we shall not present a detailed quantitative analysis of inflation. We however point out that, if the approximated expression (\ref{KCbound}) is correct, in this case the K\"ahler cone bounds seem to be more constraining than in the case discussed in the main text since the inflaton direction $\tau_f$ is bounded by ${V}^{2/3}$ instead of ${V}/\sqrt{\tau_s}$. Thus a viable inflationary dynamics in this case would require a more severe tuning of the underlying parameters and a better understanding of the validity of our effective field theory approach.

\section{Motivation for non-thermal dark matter}
\label{sec:motivation}

One of the main particle physics candidates for dark matter (DM) is a stable neutralino $\chi$ which emerges as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in several scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM). The DM relic abundance is generically \emph{assumed} to be produced thermally by the following process:
the LSP is in a thermal bath in the early universe, subsequently drops out of thermal equilibrium and freezes-out at temperatures of order
$T_f \simeq m_\chi/20$ when DM annihilation becomes inefficient.

However, we have no direct observational evidence of the history of the universe before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
for temperatures above $T_{\rm BBN} \simeq 3$ MeV. There is therefore no reason to assume a very simple cosmological history characterised by just a single period of radiation dominance from the end of inflation until BBN. In fact, the presence of a period of matter domination between the end of inflation and BBN could completely change the final prediction for the DM relic density if the reheating temperature at the end of this period of matter dominance is below $T_f$~\cite{MR,Moroi:1999zb}.

This non-thermal picture emerges generically in UV theories like string theory due to the ubiquitous presence
of gravitationally coupled scalars~\cite{CMP, NTDM, Allahverdi:2013noa}.
During inflation these fields, called moduli, get a displacement from their minimum that is in general of order $M_P$~\cite{DRT}. After the end of inflation,
when the Hubble constant reaches their mass, $H\sim m_{\rm mod}$, they start oscillating around their minimum and store energy.
Redshifting as matter, they quickly dominate the energy density of the universe which gets reheated when the moduli decay.
Being only gravitationally coupled, the moduli tend to decay very late when $H\sim \Gamma \sim m_{\rm mod}^3/M_P^2$.
The corresponding reheating temperature
\begin{equation}
T_R \sim \sqrt{\Gamma M_P}\sim m_{\rm mod} \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm mod}}{M_P}}\,,
\end{equation}
has to be larger than $T_{\rm BBN}$ in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions.\footnote{$T_R$ has also to be lower than the temperature above which the internal space decompactifies~\cite{TempDecomp}.}
This requirement sets a lower bound on the moduli masses of order $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 30$ TeV~\cite{CMP}.

Generically in string compactifications supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking effects develop a mass for the moduli
and generate by gravity or anomaly mediation soft terms of order $M_{\rm soft}$. Due to their common origin, the mass of the lightest modulus $m_{\rm mod}$
is therefore related to the scale of the soft terms as $M_{\rm soft} = \kappa m_{\rm mod}$.
Given the cosmological constraint $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 30$~TeV, only models with $\kappa\ll 1$ can allow for
low-energy SUSY to solve the hierarchy problem.
Values of $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-2})$ can come from loop suppression factors~\cite{Mirage,G2,Dudas:2012wi} while much smaller values $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$ can arise due to sequestering effects~\cite{seqLVS, Aparicio:2014wxa}. For $M_{\rm soft}\sim {O}(1)$ TeV, the corresponding reheating temperature becomes
\begin{equation}
T_R \sim  \frac{M_{\rm soft}}{\kappa^{3/2}} \sqrt{\frac{M_{\rm soft}}{M_P}} \sim \,\kappa^{-3/2}\,{O}(10^{-2})\,\,{\rm MeV}\,,
\end{equation}
which for $10^{-2}\lesssim\kappa\lesssim 10^{-4}$ is between ${O}(10)$ MeV and ${O}(10)$ GeV.
This is below the freeze-out temperature for LSP masses between ${O}(100)$ GeV and ${O}(1)$ TeV which is
$T_f \sim {O}(10-100)$ GeV. Therefore any DM relic density previously produced via the standard thermal mechanism gets erased by the late-time decay of the lightest modulus. In this new scenario, the LSP gets produced non-thermally from the modulus decay.

From a bottom-up perspective, non-thermal cosmological histories can also enlarge the available parameter space of different DM models consistent with direct and indirect detection experiments, due to the presence of the additional parameter $T_R.$ This is appealing as it is very hard to reproduce a correct thermal relic density in the CMSSM/mSUGRA (see for instance~\cite{Baer:2012uya}) since a Bino-like LSP tends to overproduce DM
(apart from some fine-tuned cases like stau co-annihilation and A-funnel or in the case of precision gauge coupling unification~\cite{Krippendorf:2013dqa}) while for a Higgsino- or Wino-like LSP the relic density is in general underabundant (except for cases like well tempered Bino/Higgsino or Bino/Wino DM~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb}).

The purpose of this paper is to study non-thermal DM in the CMSSM/mSUGRA where the free parameters are: the standard parameters of the CMSSM/mSUGRA~\cite{msugra},
i.e.~the universal scalar mass $m$, gaugino mass $M$ and trilinear coupling $A$ defined at the GUT scale, $\tan\beta$ and the sign of $\mu$, with in addition the reheating temperature $T_R$ from the decay of the lightest modulus. We shall follow the RG running of these parameters from the GUT to the electroweak (EW) scale and require a Higgs mass $m_h \simeq 125$ GeV, a correct radiative EW symmetry breaking (REWSB) and no DM non-thermal overproduction.
We shall then focus on the points satisfying all these requirements and we will impose on them several phenomenological constraints coming
from LEP~\cite{lep}, LHC~\cite{lhc}, Planck~\cite{planck}, Fermi (pass 8 limit)~\cite{fermi}, XENON100~\cite{xenon}, CDMS~\cite{cdms}, IceCube~\cite{icecube} and LUX~\cite{lux}. Moreover we shall focus only on cases where the LSP has a non-negligible Higgsino component since Bino-like DM requires a very low reheating temperature which is strongly disfavoured by dark radiation bounds in the context of many string models~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. Interestingly we shall find that the constraints from Fermi and LUX are very severe and do not rule out the entire non-thermal CMSSM parameter space only for reheating temperatures $T_R\gtrsim {O}(1)$ GeV. The best case scenario is realised for $T_R = 2$ GeV where a Higgsino-like LSP with a mass around $300$ GeV can saturate the observed DM relic abundance. For larger reheating temperatures the LSP Bino component has to increase, resulting in strong direct detection bounds which allow only for cases with DM underproduction. Values of $T_R$ above $1$ GeV require 
values of $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-4})$ which can be realised only in models where the CMSSM is sequestered from the sources of SUSY breaking~\cite{seqLVS, Aparicio:2014wxa}. Apart from DM, these models are very promising since they can be embedded in globally consistent Calabi-Yau compactifications~\cite{CYembedding}, allow for TeV-scale SUSY and successful inflationary models~\cite{KMI}, do not feature any cosmological moduli problem,\footnote{Ref.~\cite{Dutta2015x} provides a significant bound on moduli masses and the number of e-foldings during inflation which can be a challenge for many models.} are compatible with gauge coupling unification and do not suffer from any moduli-induced gravitino problem~\cite{gravProbl}.

In Sec.~2 we discuss CMSSM soft terms, in Sec.~3 we analyse the
non-thermal CMSSM, in Sec.~4 we discuss our results and conclusions are
given in Sec.~5.

\section{CMSSM soft terms}

In a UV completion of the MSSM like string theory, SUSY is spontaneously
broken by some dynamical mechanism which generates particular relations
between the soft terms via gravity, anomaly or gauge mediation. In the
case when the soft terms are universal at the GUT scale, they are given by
the scalar mass $m$, the gaugino mass $M$, the trilinear coupling $A$ and
the bilinear Higgs mixing $B$. We can generically parameterise these soft
terms and the $\mu$ parameter at the GUT scale as:
\begin{equation}
m = a\ |M|\,,\quad A = b\ M\,,\quad B = c \ M\,, \quad \mu = d\ M\,,
\label{CMSSM}
\end{equation}
where, in a stringy embedding, the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are
functions of the underlying parameters while the gaugino mass $M$ sets the
overall scale of the soft terms in terms of the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$.
In order to perform a phenomenological analysis of this scenario one has
to follow the renormalisation group (RG) evolution of these soft terms
from the GUT to the EW scale and impose the following constraints: a
correct REWSB, a Higgs mass of order $m_h \simeq 125$ GeV, no DM
overproduction and no contradiction with flavour observables and with any
experimental result in either particle physics or cosmology.

A viable REWSB can be obtained if at the EW scale the following two
relations are satisfied:
\begin{equation}
\mu^2 = \frac{m_{H_d}^2-m_{H_u}^2 
\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1}-\frac{m_Z^2}{2}\,,
\label{resb1}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\sin(2\beta)=\frac{2 |B\mu|}{m_{H_d}^2+m_{H_u}^2 + 2\mu^2}\,.
\label{resb2}
\end{equation}
Given that the requirement of a correct REWSB fixes only the magnitude of
$\mu$ leaving its sign as free, the parameters (\ref{CMSSM}) are typically
traded for the standard CMSSM/mSUGRA parameters:
\begin{equation}
m = a\ |M|\,,\quad A = b\ M\,,\quad \tan\beta\equiv \frac{\langle
H_u^0\rangle}{\langle H_d^0\rangle}\,, \quad {\rm sign}(\mu)\,,
\label{CMSSMparameters}
\end{equation}
where one runs $m$, $M$ and $A$ (or $a$, $b$ and $M$ in our case) from the
GUT to the EW scale
with a particular choice of $\tan\beta$ and sign$(\mu)$.
Eqs.~(\ref{resb1}) and (\ref{resb2}) then give the value of $B$ and $\mu$
at the EW scale. This is the way in which typical spectrum generators operate.\footnote{Here we use \texttt{SPheno} v3.3.3~\cite{spheno}.}
The boundary values of $B$ and $\mu$ at the GUT scale which give a correct
REWSB can be obtained by running back $B$ and $\mu$ from the EW to the GUT
scale. 
In this way we obtain the values of the coefficients $c$ and $d$.
In a viable UV model, these values of $c$ and $d$ have to be compatible
with the values allowed by the stringy dynamics responsible for SUSY
breaking and the generation of soft terms.


\section{Non-thermal CMSSM}
\label{SecResults}

As motivated in Sec.~\ref{sec:motivation}, we shall consider scenarios where the LSP is produced non-thermally like in the case of string compactifications where the reheating temperature $T_R$ from the decay of the lightest modulus is generically below the thermal freeze-out temperature~\cite{NTDM, Allahverdi:2013noa}.
This reheating temperature represents an additional parameter which has to be supplemented to the standard free parameters of the CMSSM ($a$, $b$, $M$, $\tan\beta$ and the sign of $\mu$). We call this new scenario the `non-thermal CMSSM' which is characterised by the following free parameters: $T_R$, $a$, $b$, the gaugino mass $M$, $\tan \beta$ and the sign of $\mu$.


\subsection{Non-thermal dark matter relic density}

The abundance of DM particles $\chi$ produced non-thermally by the decay of the lightest modulus is given by~\cite{Moroi:1999zb}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{dmdens}
\left({n_\chi \over s}\right)^{\rm NT} = {\rm min} \left[\left({n_\chi \over s}\right)_{\rm obs}
{\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th} \over \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f} \sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({T_f \over T_R}\right),
Y_{\rm mod}~ {\rm Br}_\chi \right] \, , \nonumber \\
\,
\end{eqnarray}
where $g_*$ is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}\simeq 2 \times 10^{-26} {\rm cm}^3\,{\rm s}^{-1}$
is the annihilation rate at the time of freeze-out needed in the thermal case to reproduce the observed DM abundance:
\begin{equation}
\left({n_\chi \over s}\right)_{\rm obs} = \left(\Omega_\chi h^2\right)_{\rm obs} \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm crit}}{m_\chi s h^2}\right) \simeq 0.12 \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm crit}}{m_\chi s h^2}\right),
\label{obs}
\end{equation}
whereas the yield of particle abundance from modulus decay is:
\begin{equation}
Y_{\rm mod} \equiv {3 T_R \over 4 m_{\rm mod}} \sim \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm mod}}{M_P}}\,.
\label{yield}
\end{equation}
${\rm Br}_\chi$ denotes the branching ratio for modulus decays into $R$-parity odd particles which subsequently decay to DM.

The expression (\ref{dmdens}) leads to two scenarios for non-thermal DM:
\begin{enumerate}
\item `Annihilation scenario': in this case the DM abundance is given by the first term on the right-hand side of eq.~(\ref{dmdens})
and the DM particles undergo some annihilation after their initial production by modulus decay.
In order to avoid DM overabundance one needs
\begin{equation}
\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f \geq \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}\,\sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}} \left(\frac{T_f}{T_R}\right).
\end{equation}
Given that $T_R < T_f$ and $g_*(T_R) < g_*(T_f)$, this scenario requires
$\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f > \langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle_f^{\rm Th}$ as in the case of thermal underproduction.
This condition is satisfied by a Higgsino- or Wino-like LSP but not by a pure Bino-like LSP which would generically lead to non-thermal overproduction (apart from the aforementioned cases). However, given that we shall focus on models with just gravity mediated SUSY breaking (contributions from anomaly mediation are subleading) and universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale as in~\cite{seqLVS, Aparicio:2014wxa}, the LSP can never be Wino-like due to the RG running of the gauginos.\footnote{Moreover a Wino-like LSP has a significantly larger annihilation cross section than a Higgsino-like LSP resulting in a strong conflict with Fermi bounds for sub-TeV Wino-like DM~\cite{Cohen:2013ama}.}
In this context, the `Annihilation scenario' requires a Higgsino-like DM. Let us finally point out that the non-thermal DM relic density can be written in terms of the thermal one as:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_\chi^{\rm NT} h^2 = \sqrt{\frac{g_*(T_f)}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({T_f \over T_R}\right) \Omega_\chi^{\rm Th} h^2\,.
\label{NTdm}
\end{equation}
For $5$ GeV $< T_f < 80$ GeV (corresponding to $100$ GeV $< m_\chi < 1.6$ TeV), the top, the Higgs, the Z and the W$^\pm$ are not relativistic, giving $g_*(T_f)=86.25$ and:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_\chi^{\rm NT} h^2 = 0.142 \,\sqrt{\frac{10.75}{g_*(T_R)}}\left({m_\chi \over T_R}\right) \Omega_\chi^{\rm Th} h^2\,.
\label{nonthermaldm}
\end{equation}

\item `Branching scenario': in this case the DM abundance is given by the second term on the right-hand side of eq.~(\ref{dmdens})
and the DM particles are produced directly from the modulus decay since their residual annihilation is inefficient.
In this case both large and small cross sections can satisfy the DM content since the annihilation cross section does not have any impact on the DM content. This scenario is very effective to understand the DM and baryon abundance coincidence problem~\cite{Allahverdi:2010im}.
Given that in general we have ${\rm Br}_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, in order not to overproduce DM for LSP masses of order hundreds of GeV, one needs $Y_{\rm mod}\lesssim 10^{-9}$. This condition requires a very low reheating temperature:
\begin{equation}
T_R\lesssim 10^{-9} m_{\rm mod} = 10^{-9}\kappa^{-1} M_{\rm soft}\,.
\end{equation}
For $M_{\rm soft}\sim {O}(1)$ TeV and $\kappa\sim{O}(10^{-2}-10^{-4})$ we find $T_R\lesssim {O}(10)$ MeV. In order to obtain such a low reheating temperature one has in general to consider models where the modulus coupling to visible sector fields is loop suppressed~\cite{Allahverdi:2013noa}. However in this case it is very challenging to avoid a large modulus branching ratio into hidden sector light fields like stringy axions~\cite{DR} and so typically dark radiation is overproduced~\cite{Allahverdi:2014ppa}. Therefore the `Branching scenario' does not seem very promising from the phenomenological point of view.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Collider and CMB constraints}

Due to the considerations mentioned above, if the LSP is Bino-like we generically get DM overproduction also in the non-thermal case. We shall therefore look for particular regions in the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space where the LSP has a non-negligible Higgsino component. We have developed a Monte Carlo programme to find the regions of this parameter space where the LSP is Higgsino-like, the Higgs mass is around $125.5$ GeV,\footnote{Both ATLAS and CMS give values of the Higgs mass between $125$ and $126$ GeV. In what follows,  we will consider ranges of values in this region, allowing to some extent for the uncertainty in the spectrum generators as well. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the Higgs mass does not alter the following results qualitatively.}
REWSB takes place correctly and the following phenomenological constraints are satisfied: 
\begin{itemize}
\item LEP~\cite{lep} and LHC~\cite{lhc} constraints on neutralino and chargino direct production: $m_\chi \gtrsim 100$ GeV;
\item LHC~\cite{lhc} bounds on gluino and squark masses: $m_{\tilde{g}} \gtrsim 1300$ GeV;
\item LHC constraints from flavour physics: BR$(B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$~\cite{lhcb} and the constraint on BR$(b\rightarrow s\gamma)$~\cite{pdg};
\item Planck data on DM relic density~\cite{planck}.
\end{itemize}
To avoid complications with the applicability of the standard \texttt{Spheno} version, we restrict our scan on the following parameter ranges: $\tan\beta=1$ to $55,$ $a=0\,{\rm to}\,10,$ $b=-5\,{\rm to}\,5,$ and the universal gaugino mass at the high scale $M=0.3-3$~TeV. The results are shown in Figs. \ref{Fig3}-\ref{Fig5} for positive $\mu$ (the LSP relic density has been calculated using \verb"micrOMEGAS" v3~\cite{micromegas}). 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{higgsinolike.png}
\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{omegas.png}
\caption{Correlation between $a=m/M$ and $b=A/M$ for different LSP compositions (left) and DM thermal relic densities (right)
in the region where the LSP is at least 10\% Higgsino.}
\label{Fig3}
\end{figure}

The plots in Fig.~\ref{Fig3} show the points surviving the above constraints in the $A/M$-$m/M$ plane (at the GUT scale). The points fit into a V-shaped band illustrating a slight hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses ($m\gtrsim 5 M$) and values of $A$ almost symmetric around $A\simeq M$. The regions shown in the plot are mostly for $T_R$ rather smaller than $T_f$ which keeps mostly the focus point regions in the allowed parameter space. The coannihilation and A-funnel regions can also contribute to the allowed parameter space but they are very fine tuned. The V-shape of our plots is caused by the focus point region which can be obtained by setting $\mu\sim m_Z$ in the EWSB condition with loop corrections. In fact, the dependence of $\mu^2$ on $A$, $M$ and $m$ arises through $m_{H_u}^2$ which depends on the UV soft terms in the following way: $M^2(f(Q) + g(Q) A/M+ h(Q) (A/M)^2 + e(Q) (m/M)^2)$, where $f$, $g$, $h$ and $e$ depend on dimensionless gauge and Yukawa couplings ($e$ also includes the tadpole correction from the stop loop)
 and $Q$ is the SUSY breaking scale~\cite{FMM}. A leading order cancellation in this expression, 
as needed to achieve a small $\mu$-term in (\ref{resb1}), gives a V-shaped band in the $A/M$-$m/M$ plane. We also apply the Higgs mass constraint in this parameter space which depends on the square of $X_t\equiv A_t-\mu \cot\beta$~\cite{Carena:1995bx} and $X_t^2$ preserves the V-shape due to its dependence on $(A/M)^2$.

\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{gaugino.png}
\caption{Correlation between $a=m/M$ and $b=A/M$ for different values of $\tan\beta$ (left) and gaugino mass (right)
in the region where the LSP is at least 10\% Higgsino.}
\label{Fig4}
\end{figure}

To illustrate the allowed parameter range and to illustrate different aspects of the surviving points, we show the following plots (for positive sign of $\mu$):
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Fig.~\ref{Fig3}, the colour codes illustrate the percentage of Higgsino-like neutralino on the left plot and the neutralino contribution to the thermal DM relic density on the right. Note that in most of the points the neutralinos contribute only a small percentage of the total DM relic density and other DM candidates, such as axions, have to be present. The thermal DM relic density is close to the observed Planck value only in a small region corresponding to an LSP that is approximately 50\% Bino and 50\% Higgsino. However, as we will see in the next section, after imposing indirect detection constraints from Fermi, the only region which survives is the one where thermal DM is underabundant (by about 10\% of the observed relic density). On the other hand, as we shall see in the next section, non-thermal Higgsino-like DM can lead to larger relic densities which can saturate the Planck value for reheating temperatures around $2$ - $3$ GeV.

\item The colour codes in Fig.~\ref{Fig4} illustrate the dependence on $\tan\beta$ on the left plot and different values of gaugino masses on the right plot with well-defined domains for different ranges of gaugino masses inside the V-shaped band. Note that $\tan\beta$ tends to have larger values as expected from the fit of $m_h$ and the parameter ranges in this scan. Smaller values of $A/M$ and $m/M$ are preferred for larger gaugino mass due to RG flow of masses to fit the experimental value of $m_h$.

\item For Fig.~\ref{Fig5} the colours illustrate on the left the different values of the typical scale of SUSY particles $M_{\rm SUSY}$, defined here as the averaged stop mass $M_{\rm SUSY}^2=m_{\tilde{t}_1} m_{\tilde{t}_2}$. Notice that $M_{\rm SUSY}$ is around $4$ - $5$ TeV. In principle, we could explore values larger than $5$ TeV however it would bring us beyond the level of applicability of the spectrum generator \verb"SPheno" we have been using which assume similar values for all soft terms. An analysis for a split-like SUSY case with larger differences between sfermions and gaugino masses would be required in that case but this goes beyond the scope of this article. The colours on the right plot illustrate the dependence on the Higgs mass for which we have taken $m_h=125, 125.5, 126$ GeV respectively. Note that for $m_h=126$ GeV there are allowed points only on the left of the V-shaped band because of the above mentioned cut-off on $M_{\rm SUSY}$. Generally speaking we see that by allowing a larger range for the Higgs mass, we widen the V-shaped region. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Direct and indirect detection constraints}

In the figures above we have set $\mu>0$ but their pattern does not change for $\mu<0$. The next step is to impose the following phenomenological constraints for the separate case of positive and negative $\mu$ since the DM direct detection cross section depends on sign$(\mu)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fermi bounds on DM indirect detection~\cite{fermi};
\item IceCube~\cite{icecube} and XENON100~\cite{xenon} bounds for spin dependent DM direct detection;
\item LUX~\cite{lux}, CDMS~\cite{cdms} bounds on spin independent DM direct detection.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Results for positive $\mu$}

If we impose the above constraints, indirect detection bounds turn out to be very severe. 
Using the new Fermi bounds (pass 8 limit)
coming from data collected until 2014 (the pass 7 limit includes only data until 2012), we do not find any allowed point for $T_R\lesssim 2$ GeV.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{fig4lhsu.png}
\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{F8TR2000_h.png}

\caption{Case with $\mu>0$: $m/M$ vs $A/M$ after imposing LEP, LHC, Planck and Fermi constraints (left)
and corresponding LSP composition (right) for $m_h = 125.5$ - $126$ GeV and $T_R = 2, 10$ GeV.}
\label{Fig6}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{Fig6} we show the results for different reheating temperatures. The red points show the parameter space where we saturate the DM content measured from Planck~\cite{planck}. We find more allowed points for $T_R=10$ GeV compared to $T_R=2$ GeV since the ratio of $T_f/T_R$ becomes smaller for large $T_R$, and so a smaller annihilation cross section is needed, resulting in a better chance to satisfy the bounds from Fermi. We only see the large Higgsino dominated regions for smaller $T_R$ since in this case a larger annihilation cross section is needed to saturate the DM content. For larger $T_R$, an LSP with a smaller Higgsino component becomes allowed (higher Bino component) and this region appears for smaller values of gaugino mass.
We finally mention that the Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM annihilation during the recombination epoch are less stringent than those of Fermi for our scenarios.

Fig.~\ref{Fig7} shows the spin independent and spin dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section after imposing LEP, LHC, Planck and Fermi constraints for $T_R = 10$ GeV. IceCube bounds rule out the orange and red regions of the right-hand side plot of Fig.~\ref{Fig7}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{Fig7}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{Fig9} shows the inclusion of LUX bounds on the spin independent direct detection constraints which rule out most of the points in Fig.~\ref{Fig7} apart from a region corresponding to LSP masses around $300$ GeV which is at the border of detectability.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{Fig9}
\end{figure}

Moreover, for $T_R=2$ GeV there are red points which saturate the observed DM content. In this case the neutralinos are becoming more pure Higgsinos in order to enhance the annihilation cross section and the Fermi constraint becomes harder to avoid but there are still regions allowed by both direct and indirect detection searches. There are more green points for $T_R=10$ GeV since the annihilation cross section becomes smaller due to Bino mixing which means a larger allowed region after using Fermi data but the constraint from the direct detection becomes more stringent (due to Bino-Higgsino mixing in the LSP) and so there are no red points which saturate the observed DM content.\footnote{The direct detection exclusion however depends on various uncertainties, e.g.~strange quark content of proton, form factor etc.~\cite{Accomando:1999eg}.} For the points shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig9}, the GUT values $c= B/M$ and $d=\mu/M$ are around $0.6$ and $1$ respectively.

\subsubsection{Results for negative $\mu$}

The results for the negative $\mu$ case are shown in Figs. \ref{Fig10} and \ref{Fig11}. 
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{fig7lhsu.png}

and LSP composition (right) for $m_h = 125.5$ - $126$ GeV and $T_R = 2, 10$ GeV.}
\label{Fig10}
\end{figure}
Note that under the same conditions the allowed parameter space for $\mu<0$ is larger than the one for $\mu>0$. This can be understood as follows~\cite{positivemu}: $\sigma_{\tilde\chi^0_1-p}$ is dominated by the t-channel $h$, $H$ exchange diagrams which mostly arise from down type (s-quark) interaction:
\begin{equation}
A^d\propto m_d\left({\frac{\cos\alpha}{\cos\beta}}{\frac{F_H}{m_H^2}}-{\frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\beta}}{\frac{F_h}{m_h^2}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the Higgs mixing angle, $F_h=(N_{12}-N_{11}\tan\theta_W)(N_{14}\cos\alpha+N_{13}\sin\alpha)$ and $F_H=(N_{12}-N_{11}\tan\theta_W)(N_{14}\sin\alpha-N_{13}\cos\alpha)$ using $\tilde\chi^0_1=N_{11}\tilde B+N_{12}\tilde W+N_{13}\tilde H_1+N_{14}\tilde H_2$. For $\mu<0$, the ratio $N_{14}/N_{13}$ is positive and this amplitude can become small due to cancellations if:
\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{14}}{N_{13}}=- {\frac{\tan\alpha+m_h^2/m_H^2 \cot\alpha}{1+m_h^2/m_H^2}}\,,
\end{equation}
is satisfied (for $\tan\alpha<0$). In Fig.~\ref{Fig11} there are more allowed points compared to Fig.~\ref{Fig9} even if there are still no points which saturate the observed DM content for $T_R=10$ GeV due to stringent direct detection constraints. For the points shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig11}, the GUT scale values of $B$ and $\mu$ are still both of order $M$.

\section{Discussion of results}\vspace{-0.1cm}
\subsection{Analysis of the allowed parameter space}\vspace{-0.1cm}
We are now in a position to put all our results together and explain the effect of each experimental bound on our parameter space.
In the end we shall analyse the spectrum of superpartners that appears for the points surviving all the phenomenological constraints. All the observables analysed in this section have been computed numerically using \verb"micrOMEGAS" v3~\cite{micromegas} linked to \verb"SPheno" v3.3.3~\cite{spheno}.

Fig.~\ref{Fig12} shows the relation between the spin independent WIMP-nucleon cross section and the LSP mass. Depending on $T_R$ there is a different upper bound for neutralino masses which is given by the Planck constraint on DM. For larger values of $T_R$, the non-thermal relic density decreases, 
and so heavier neutralinos can pass the Planck constraint on the DM relic density. On the other hand, for larger $T_R$ the parameter space for standard thermal DM (orange band) becomes also larger. Note that LUX 2013 results exclude at 90\% most of the parameter space and the next round of results (LUX 300 days) will be able to probe the remaining regions (the light blue points below the LUX line).

In the scenario we considered, the gaugino masses are unified at the GUT scale and therefore the evolution of electroweakinos is totally dominated by the RG flow. This implies that the LSP can only be Higgsino- or Bino-like (or a mixed combination of them). The largest contributions to the thermal averaged annihilation rates are given by (see for example~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb} and references therein):
\begin{equation}
\langle \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle = \frac{g_2^4}{512 \pi \mu^2}\left(21 + 3 \tan^2\theta_W +  11 \tan^4\theta_W   \right),
\label{sigmamu}
\end{equation}
for Higgsino-like neutralinos (in the limit $M_W \ll \mu$) annihilating into vector bosons through chargino or neutralino interchange, and:
\begin{equation}
\langle  \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle =  \sum_f \frac{g_2^4 \tan^2 \theta_W \left( T_{3_f} - Q_f \right)^4 r (1+r^2)}{2\pi m_{\tilde f}^2(1+r)^4}\,,
\label{sigmab}
\end{equation}
for Bino-like LSP annihilation into fermion-antifermion ($T_{3_f}$ and $Q_f$ are the third component of isospin and the fermion charge and $r = M_1^2 / m_{\tilde f}^2$). This process is driven at tree level by the t-channel exchange of a slepton ${\tilde f}$. In the case where the LSP is a mixed composition of Higgsino and Bino, the expression of the annihilation rate is an interpolation between (\ref{sigmamu}) and (\ref{sigmab}).
Fig.~\ref{Fig12} shows also the effect of Fermi bounds. As suggested by (\ref{sigmamu}) and (\ref{sigmab}), the most constrained regions are those with smaller LSP masses. The grey band corresponds to points excluded by LEP bounds on chargino direct production.

Fig.~\ref{Fig13} shows the amount of non-thermal DM relic density provided by the LSP in terms of its mass, together with the bounds from indirect detection and LUX. The Planck value of the DM content can be saturated in the region which is not ruled out by direct detection bounds only for $T_R = 2$ GeV. Given that for larger $T_R$ the amount of LSP DM gets smaller, the cases with $T_R > 2$ GeV require multi-component DM. Combining  Fig.~\ref{Fig12} and Fig.~\ref{Fig13}, we find  that the LUX allowed regions, indirect detection limits and the abundance of LSP DM are correlated for different $T_R$. The allowed regions, where the observed DM content is saturated, depend on $T_R$ but they are generically around $m_\chi \simeq 300$ GeV.

In Fig.~\ref{Fig14}, we show the Planck constraints on indirect detection through DM annihilation during the recombination epoch. We use $WW$ final states corresponding to an efficiency factor $f_{\rm eff}= 0.2$~\cite{Madhavacheril:2013cna}. Even going all the way to the cosmic variance bound, these constraints turn out to be less stringent than those coming from Fermi and LUX. On the other hand, Fig.~\ref{Fig14} shows the correlation between the LSP composition and the bounds coming from both direct and indirect detection. Concerning Fermi and Planck limits on DM annihilation, these bounds allow almost all possible combinations of Bino/Higgsino neutralinos. The restrictions coming from the $f \bar f$ and $W\bar W$ channels depend on the neutralino composition: for a Higgsino-like LSP, the most stringent constraint is due to annihilation into vector bosons, while for a Bino-like LSP the main constraint comes from annihilation into a fermion-antifermion pair.

The LUX constraints in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} reduce the parameter space to the region where the LSP is mostly Higgsino-like. This could be a bit puzzling since the WIMP-nucleon cross section is dominated by the Higgs exchange channel:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\chi-p} \propto \frac{a_{\tilde H}^2 (g' a_{\tilde B} - g \ a_{\tilde W})^2}{m_h^4}\,,
\label{xip}
\end{equation}
where $a_{\tilde H}$, $a_{\tilde B}$ and $a_{\tilde W}$ are respectively the Higgsino, Bino and Wino LSP components. According to this expression, the cross section is enhanced when the Higgsino component increases. However in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} direct detection bounds allow only points which are mainly Higgsino-like. The reason of this effect is in the effective coupling $\tilde{\chi} \tilde{\chi}  h$ which for a Bino-like LSP looks like:
\begin{equation}
C_{\tilde{\chi}\tilde{\chi} h} \simeq \frac{m_Z \sin \theta_W \tan \theta_W}{M_1^2 -\mu^2}\left( M_1 + \mu \sin 2\beta \right),
\label{Cb}
\end{equation}
where for moderate to large $\tan \beta$ the second term is negligible and $\mu > M_1$. Hence this coupling is dominated by $M_1$. On the other hand, the coupling for a Higgsino-like LSP is:
\begin{equation}
C_{\tilde{\chi}\tilde{\chi} h} \simeq \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 \pm \sin 2\beta  \right)\left( \tan^2 \theta_W\frac{m_Z \cos \theta}{M_1 - |\mu|} +\frac{m_Z \cos \theta}{M_2 - |\mu|} \right),
\label{Cn}
\end{equation}
where $\pm$ is for the $H_u$ and $H_d$ components and $\mu < M_1$. Contrary to the Bino-like case, this coupling is inversely proportional to $M_1$. 
Thus the WIMP-nucleon cross section grows in the regions where the LSP is Higgsino-like and $M_1$ is small or where the LSP is Bino-like and the gaugino mass is large. If we compare Fig.~\ref{Fig4} (right) which shows the distribution of gaugino masses along the V-shaped band, with Fig.~\ref{Fig6} (right) and \ref{Fig10} (right), we realise that the region with a smaller cross section is the one at the bottom of the V-shaped band where gaugino masses are big and the LSP is very Higgsino-like. The region where the LSP is more Bino-like has smaller gaugino masses and the cross section is larger.
Fermi constraints however become more stringent in the case with more Higgsino content due to larger annihilation cross section. The competition between LUX and Fermi constraints produces the allowed parameter space where the Planck value of the DM content is saturated for $T_R=2$ GeV.

Finally, in Fig.~\ref{Fig14} there is a change of behaviour of the thermal averaged cross section for masses around $130$ GeV. The reason is the following: this region is (as can be shown in the plot) Higgsino-like, but the masses are closer to $M_W$ and  $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is no longer described by (\ref{sigmamu}) but by something like (with $x=\mu/m_W$):
\begin{equation}
\langle \sigma_{\rm eff} v \rangle \sim \frac{9g^4}{16 \pi m_W^2} \frac{x^2}{(4x^2-1)^2}\,.
\end{equation}
In Fig.~\ref{Fig7a}, we show the spectra of SUSY particles for the allowed regions of Fig.~\ref{Fig9} (blue points below the LUX line). We find that sleptons, staus, Higgses, all other scalar masses and gluinos are rather heavy since they are between about $2$ and $7$ TeV. The lightest and second to lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are around $280$ - $340$ GeV while all other neutralinos and charginos are heavy. The allowed region for $T_R=2$ GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label $T_R=2$ GeV where the points situated exactly on the line satisfy all the constraints including the current DM content as measured by Planck. Similarly, the allowed region for $T_R\geq 5$ GeV is shown on the left side of the vertical line with the label $T_R\geq 5$ GeV even if there are no points in this region which saturate the current DM content. Notice that the spectrum is essentially independent of the reheating temperature $T_R$ and the hierarchy between the different sparticles is robust.

\subsection{Astrophysical uncertainties}

The direct detection cross section can involve various uncertainties, e.g.~strange quark content of proton, form factor, local DM density and LSP contribution to the total amount of observed DM abundance.  The local density can be 0.1-0.7 GeV/cm$^3$~\cite{Read}. There could also be astrophysical uncertainties in the indirect detection results beyond what has been considered so far. Recently, it is  mentioned in \cite{baer} that if the thermal neutralinos do not produce the entire amount of cold dark matter, the  
 direct and indirect detection cross sections should be reduced by $R$ and $R^2$ respectively with $R\equiv \Omega h^2/0.12$. Possible bounds arising from Fermi are now almost negligible since they are suppressed by $R^2$. Once the suppression factor $R$ is taken into account, Fermi, Planck and other indirect detection experiments have lower impacts. Concerning the effect on LUX and other direct detection bounds, the cross section is now reduced by $R$ which is equivalent to multiplying the effective couplings (\ref{Cb}) and (\ref{Cn}) by $\sqrt{R}$. This clearly introduces a new parameter in 
the discussion performed in the previous section.

If we assume such a reduction in the cases where $\Omega^{NT} h^2\le 0.12$, more parameter space could be allowed for multi-component DM regions as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig15}. The pink region is disallowed by Fermi data. The $T_R$ dependence of the region constrained by Fermi in  Fig.~\ref{Fig15} is due to the fact that the  factor R is now a function of $T_R$
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\Omega^{NT} h^2}{0.12} \simeq \frac{T_f}{T_R} \frac{\Omega^{Th} h^2}{0.12}  .
\end{equation}
$R$ becomes larger for smaller values of $T_R$ (=2 GeV) and the Fermi constraint becomes important.

The region below the dashed line satisfied present LUX limits. In particular this implies that the region with lighter neutralinos is now unconstrained by LUX. This region typically corresponds to more Bino component in the LSP as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig6} (right) and \ref{Fig10} (right). We have therefore a different situation compared to before, because now neutralinos with a larger Bino component are allowed. 

Let us stress, however, that the prediction for the region where $\Omega^{NT} h^2$ saturates the DM content remains unchanged, i.e.~only the case $T_R=2$ GeV contains points which are still allowed by all data and saturate the DM content with an LSP mass around $300$ GeV.


This new factor $R$ helps us to extract more parameter space for the multi-component DM scenarios. However, the DM simulations need to establish the validity of  the assumption that proportions of various DM components in the early universe is maintained even after the large scale structures are formed.

\section{Conclusions}

Non-thermal DM scenarios emerge in UV theories like string theory due to the presence of gravitationally coupled scalars which decay at late times when they are dominating the energy density of the universe. In such models the reheating temperature due to moduli decays is typically below the freeze-out temperature, $T_R<T_f$ when assuming an MSSM particle as main DM constituent. In this paper, we have studied the non-thermal version of the CMSSM/mSUGRA and contrasted it with both particle physics and astrophysical experimental constraints. The experimental information available at this moment, including the well known value of the Higgs mass, is enough to rule out the vast majority of the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space. There is still a small region which is consistent with all observations and is at the edge of detection by both astrophysics and particle physics experiments, resulting in a very interesting situation for beyond the SM physics.

In our determination of the allowed parameter space we have used constraints from collider experiments (LEP, LHC), cosmic microwave background observations (Planck) and direct and indirect DM searches (Fermi, XENON100, IceCube, LUX, CDMS). We have found that the most restrictive constraints come from Fermi and LUX which single out a small region of the non-thermal CMSSM parameter space corresponding to a Higgsino-like LSP with a mass around $300$ GeV that can saturate the observed DM abundance for $T_R\simeq 2$~GeV while larger reheating temperatures require additional contributions to the present DM abundance.
These results are summarised in Fig.~\ref{Fig13} which shows the comparison between the cases of positive and negative $\mu$.

This non-thermal scenario leads to a clear pattern of SUSY particles. In particular, the fact that the LSP is Higgsino-like makes the lightest chargino, the lightest neutralino and next to lightest neutralino to be almost degenerate in mass. This kind of scenario can be probed at the LHC using monojet plus soft leptons plus missing energy~\cite{tata}, monojet signal~\cite{mono} and two Vector Boson Fusion jets and large missing transverse energy~\cite{dutta}. On the other hand, all the other superpartners are much heavier and beyond the LHC reach but accessible to potential future experiments such as a $100$ TeV machine.

It is worth mentioning that non-thermal CMSSM scenarios with TeV-scale soft terms and reheating temperatures around $1$ - $10$ GeV can emerge in string models where the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of SUSY breaking~\cite{seqLVS, Aparicio:2014wxa}. In a subset of the parameter range these string scenarios lead to $M_{\rm soft}\sim M_P \epsilon^2 \ll m_{\rm mod}\sim M_P \epsilon^{3/2} \ll M_{\rm GUT} \sim M_P \epsilon^{1/3}$ and $T_R\sim M_P \epsilon^{9/4}$ where $\epsilon \simeq m_{3/2}/M_P\ll 1$. For $\epsilon \sim 10^{-8}$, one obtains TeV-scale soft terms, $M_{\rm GUT}\sim 10^{16}$ GeV, $T_R\sim 1 -10$ GeV and $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^6$ GeV for $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV.

We point out that our analysis is based on the CMSSM/mSUGRA for which all superpartners are expected to be at similar masses close to the TeV scale. In this sense we restricted ourselves to scalar masses lighter than $5$ TeV which is the range of validity of the codes we have used to perform our analysis. There are however several ways to generalise this simplest scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider non-universal extensions of the CMSSM. Small departures from universality, even though strongly constrained by flavour changing neutral currents, allow more flexibility in the parameter space and will slightly enhance the allowed region.

\item Consider sfermions heavier than $5$ TeV as in the split SUSY case. This is not only an interesting phenomenological possibility but is also the other class of scenarios that were derived in the string compactifications studied in~\cite{seqLVS, Aparicio:2014wxa}.

\item Consider MSSM scenarios with R-parity violation and late decaying moduli fields. This class of models has not been studied in detail and given the fact that even with R-parity conservation there seems to be a need for other sources of DM such as axions or axinos, this should be a possibility worth studying.

\item Consider explicit D-brane models which tend to generate models beyond the standard MSSM (see for instance~\cite{dolan,maharanareview} for such models).
\end{itemize}

It is encouraging that new planned experiments such as upcoming LUX result and XENON1T will be enough to rule out the rest of the allowed parameter space, independent of the upcoming LHC run. Clearly also new LHC runs and future planned colliders will be crucial for this class of models.
Combining astrophysical and collider measurements is probably the most efficient way to constrain beyond the SM physics and this article is a clear illustration of this strategy.

\section{ Computation of the variance of \texorpdfstring{$F \tilde F$}{FFdual} \label{app:variance_computation}}
In this appendix we are interested in computing the variation of $\langle F \tilde F \rangle$ with respect to its background value, which we employ to estimate the non-linear contribution to the scalar power spectrum in Sec.~\ref{subsec:PS}. In general this can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
 \delta (\langle F \tilde F \rangle ) = [F \tilde F - \langle F \tilde F \rangle ]_{\delta \phi = 0} + \frac{\partial \langle F \tilde F \rangle }{\partial \dot \phi} \dot{\delta \phi} \equiv \delta_{\vec{EB}} + \frac{\partial \langle F \tilde F \rangle }{\partial \dot \phi} \dot{\delta \phi} \,,
\end{equation}
where we are using the sign convention $\dot \phi > 0$, $\langle F \tilde F \rangle >  0$ (see \cite{Linde:2012bt}). Notice that this corresponds to considering the variation of $\langle F \tilde F \rangle$ due to variations of $\delta \phi$ (second term) plus the variations of $\langle F \tilde F \rangle$ due to the variations of the gauge fields. In order to perform the computation of the latter it is useful to introduce the electric and magnetic fields (in conformal time)
\begin{equation}
  F^{a}_{0i} \equiv - a^2(\tau) E_{i}^a \, , \qquad \qquad F^{a}_{ij} \equiv \varepsilon^{ijk} a^2(\tau) B_{k}^a \, .
\end{equation}
With these definitions we can trivially show that:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:FF_EB}
  F^a_{\mu \nu} F^a_{\rho \sigma} g^{\mu \rho} g^{\nu \sigma } & = & - \frac{2}{a^4} F^a_{0 i} F^a_{0 i} + \frac{1}{a^4} F^a_{i j} F^a_{i j} = - 2 \left[ \left( \vec{E}^a \right)^2 - \left( \vec{B}^a \right)^2 \right] \, . \\
  \label{eq:FFdual_EB}
  F^a_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^a_{\rho \sigma} & = & \frac{4}{2 \sqrt{-g}} F^a_{0 i} F^a_{j k} \varepsilon^{ijk} = - 2 E^a_{i} B_{l}^a \varepsilon^{ijk}  \varepsilon^{ljk} = - 4 \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^a \, .
\end{eqnarray}
We can then proceed by computing the expressions of $E^a_{i}$ and $B^a_{i}$ (neglecting terms depending on $A_0^a$) up to second order:
\begin{eqnarray}
  E^a_{i} & = & - \frac{1}{a^2} \left[\delta^a_i \partial_0 f + \partial_0 \delta A^a_i  \right]\,, \\
  B^a_{i} & = & \frac{1}{ a^2} \left[ \varepsilon_{ijk} \partial_j \delta A^a_k + e f^2 \delta^a_i  - e f \delta A^i_a  +e \frac{\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{abc}}{2} \delta A^b_j  \delta A^c_k  \right]\, , 
\end{eqnarray}
where we have neglected terms proportional to the helicity 0 quantity $\delta A^a_a$ since they do not feature the exponential enhancement present in the $e_{+2}$ mode. Notice that setting $e = 0$ we can easily recover the usual abelian terms.\\


\noindent With this notation it is now trivial to check that the expectation value of $F \tilde{F}$ can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \langle F^a_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{a \, \mu \nu} \rangle = - 4 \langle \vec{E}^a \cdot \vec{B}^{a } \rangle \equiv  - 4 T_0 \, ,
\end{equation}
and the variance of $F \tilde{F}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\vec{EB}}^2 = \langle ( F^a \tilde{F}^a )^2 \rangle  -  \langle  F^a \tilde{F}^a  \rangle ^2 = 16\left[  \langle  E_i^a E_j^b \rangle \langle B_i^a B_j^b \rangle + \langle E_i^a B_j^b \rangle \langle B_i^a E_j^b \rangle \right] \, ,
\end{equation}
which has exactly the same shape as in the abelian limit (for comparison see appendix A of~\cite{Linde:2012bt}). At this point it is useful to introduce 
\begin{eqnarray}
  T_1  \equiv \left \langle E^a_{i}  E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle \, , \qquad \qquad T_2  \equiv \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i}  E^b_{j} \right \rangle \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
so that the two contributions can be computed independently. Before substituting the explicit expressions of $E$ and $B$ it is important to notice that (i) in order to compute the variance we only need terms that are exactly quadratic in the fluctuations and (ii)  the base vectors of the $\pm 2$ helicity modes are traceless in all bases (implying $\delta^a_i \left[e_{\pm2} (\vec{k})\right]^a_i = 0 $ for all $\vec{k}$). 
% 
We can now  directly compute 
\begin{align}
  \left \langle E^a_{i}  E^b_{j} \right \rangle  =& \frac{1}{a^4} \left \langle \partial_0 \delta A^a_i \partial_0 \delta A^b_j \right \rangle \, , \\
  \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle =& \frac{1}{a^4} \left \langle  \varepsilon_{ilk} \varepsilon_{jnm} \partial_l   \delta A^a_k  \partial_n \delta A^b_m + e^2 f^2 \delta A^i_a \delta A^j_b  - e f \varepsilon_{ilk} \partial_l \delta A^k_a \delta A^b_j  - e f \varepsilon_{jnm}  \delta A^i_a \partial_n \delta A^b_m \right \rangle \nonumber \\
  \equiv&  \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +  \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 +  \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 +  \left \langle B^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_4 , \\
  \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle =& - \frac{1}{a^4} \left \langle \partial_0 \delta A^a_i \varepsilon_{jnm} \partial_n \delta A^b_m  - e f  \partial_0 \delta A^a_i \delta A^j_b +  e \delta^a_i \partial_0 f \frac{\varepsilon_{jnm} \varepsilon^{bdh}}{2} \delta A^d_n  \delta A^h_m \right \rangle \nonumber \\
  \equiv&  \left \langle E^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +  \left \langle E^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 +  \left \langle E^a_{i}  B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \, .
\end{align}
Notice that again setting $e = 0$ our expressions reduce to the abelian case. 

At this point we can expand $ \delta A^a_\nu(\tau, \vec x)$ in terms of its Fourier modes as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Fourier_A}. Notice that in general the basis vectors satisfy 
\begin{equation}
   \left[ e_{\lambda, \nu}^a (\hat{k}) \right]^* = e_{\lambda, \nu}^a (-\hat{k}) \, , \qquad \qquad i \varepsilon_{ijl} k_j e_{\lambda, l}^a (\hat{k}) = \text{sgn}(\lambda) |\vec{k}| e_{\lambda, i}^a (\hat{k}) \, .
\end{equation}
Moreover, the helicity $\pm2$ vectors are symmetric, \emph{i.e.,} $e_{\pm2, i}^a = e_{\pm2, a}^i$. Using the properties of the basis vectors it is possible to show that (from now on we restrict our analysis to the $+2$ mode only)
\begin{equation}
  \left \langle E^a_{i}  E^b_{j} \right \rangle  = \frac{1}{a^4} \int \frac{\textrm{d} k \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{k}} }{(2 \pi)^{3}} \, k^2   \frac{ \partial_0 \tilde{\delta A}_{+2}(\tau,  k) \left[ \partial_0 \tilde{\delta A}_{+2}(\tau,  k) \right]^*  e_{+2, i}^a (\hat{k}) \left[ e_{+2, j}^b (\hat{k}) \right]^*  +h. c.}{2}  \, ,
\end{equation}
and analogously for the terms of $ \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle$ and $ \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle$
\begin{align}
  2 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1  = & - \frac{1}{a^4} \int \frac{\textrm{d} k \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{k}} }{(2 \pi)^{3}} \, k^3 \left\{ \partial_0 \tilde{\delta A}_{+2}(\tau,  k) \left[ \tilde{\delta A}_{+2}(\tau,  k) \right]^*  e_{+2, i}^a (\hat{k}) \left[ e_{+2, j}^b (\hat{k}) \right]^*  +h. c. \right \} \, , \\

Since $T_1 $ and $T_2 $ are respectively given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
  T_1 &=& \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left(  \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +\left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 +\left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 +\left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_4 \right) \, , \\ 
  T_2 &=& \left( \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +\left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 +\left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \right) \left( \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +\left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 +\left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \right) \, , \hspace{1cm}
\end{eqnarray}
we can immediatly see that, all the angular integrals reduce to three combinations:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Omega_1 &\equiv& \int \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{k}} \ \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{q}} \ e_{+2, i}^a (\hat{k}) \left[ e_{+2, j}^b (\hat{k}) \right]^*  e_{+2, i}^a (\hat{q}) \left[ e_{+2, j}^b (\hat{q}) \right]^* \, , \\
  \Omega_2 &\equiv& \frac{3}{4} \int \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{k}} \ \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{q}} \ \varepsilon_{jnm} \varepsilon^{bdh} \left[ e_{+2, n}^d (\hat{k}) \right] \left[ e_{+2, m}^h (\hat{k}) \right]^* \varepsilon_{jlu} \varepsilon^{bpr} \left[ e_{+2, l}^p (\hat{q}) \right] \left[ e_{+2, u}^r (\hat{q}) \right]^* , \hspace{1cm} \\
  \Omega_3 &\equiv& \int \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{k}} \ \textrm{d} \Omega_{\vec{q}} \ e_{+2, i}^a (\hat{k}) \left[ e_{+2, j}^b (\hat{k}) \right]^* \delta^a_i \frac{\varepsilon_{jnm} \varepsilon^{bdh}}{2} \left[ e_{+2, n}^d (\hat{k}) \right] \left[ e_{+2, m}^h (\hat{k}) \right]^* \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
whose direct evaluation gives
\begin{equation}
   \Omega_1 = \frac{(4\pi)^2}{5} \, ,\qquad \qquad \Omega_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{3} \, ,\qquad \qquad \Omega_3 = 0 \, . 
\end{equation}
Notice that $\Omega_3 = 0$ can be used to simplify $T_2$ as:
\begin{equation}
  T_2 = \left( \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +\left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2  \right) \left( \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 +\left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 \right) +\left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \, ,
\end{equation}
At this point we are finally left with only integrals over the absolute value of the momenta. In order to perform these integrals, we will employ Eq.~\eqref{eq:NonabelianAsymptotics2}, defining $\tilde w(x)$ as follows:
\begin{align}
  w_{+2}(x) & \simeq e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi}  \sqrt{4\pi} \left(\frac{\zeta(x)}{V(x)}\right)^{1/4}\mathrm{Ai}\left(\zeta(x)\right) \\
 &  \equiv e^{(\kappa-\mu)\pi} \tilde w(x) \,.
\end{align}
We have verified that integrating this approximate expression over the range $0 \leq x \leq 2 \xi$ agrees with the integral over the exact expression~\eqref{eq:AnalyticalSolution} extremely well, and we are moreover insensitive to the choice of the UV-cutoff. Let us start by computing for example:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1   = \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{(2 \pi)^6 a^8} \int  \frac{ \textrm{d} k  \, k^2 }{k} \left\{ \partial_0 \tilde w( x_k)  \partial_0 \tilde w( x_k)  \right \}      \int  \frac{\textrm{d} q  \, q^4}{ q} \left\{ \tilde w( x_q) \tilde w( x_q) \right \} \,,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we use the notation $x_k = - k \tau$ to keep track of the different momentum variables. We can then use $\partial_0 \tilde w( x_k)  = - k \tilde w( x_k)$ ($\prime$ here is used to denote the derivative with respect to $x_k$), $k = - x_k/ \tau$ and $\tau = - 1/(a H)$ to get
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1   = \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{(2 \pi)^6} H^8 \int  \textrm{d} x_k  \, x_k^3  \left\{\tilde w'( x_k)  \tilde w'( x_k)   \right \}     \int \textrm{d} x_q  \, x_q^3 \ \left\{\tilde w( x_q)  \tilde w( x_q)   \right \}  \, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Since all the other terms can also be expressed as a product of two integrals it is useful to introduce the six integrals:
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{I}_1 & =  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x^3 \  \tilde w'( x)  \tilde w'( x) \,, \qquad && 
  \mathcal{I}_2  =  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x^3 \ \tilde w( x) \tilde w( x)  \,, \qquad 
  \mathcal{I}_3 & =  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x \ \tilde w( x) \tilde w( x)  \,, \\ 
  \mathcal{I}_4 &  =  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x^2 \ \tilde w( x) \tilde w( x) \,, \qquad &&
  \mathcal{I}_5  =  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x^3 \ \tilde w'( x)  \tilde w( x) \,, \qquad 
  \mathcal{I}_6  &=  \int  \textrm{d} x  \, x^2 \  \tilde w'( x) \tilde w( x)   \,,
\end{align}
so that we can easily express
\begin{align}
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1   = & \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8  \mathcal{I}_1 \mathcal{I}_2  \, , \quad 
  && 4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2   =  \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 \xi^2  \mathcal{I}_1 \mathcal{I}_3  \, , \nonumber  \\
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3  = & \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 (-\xi) \mathcal{I}_1  \mathcal{I}_4  \, , \quad
  && 4 \left \langle E^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle \left \langle B^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_4   =  \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 (-\xi)  \mathcal{I}_1  \mathcal{I}_4  \, , \nonumber \\
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_1   = & \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8  \mathcal{I}_5^2  \, , \quad 
  && 4 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_2   =  \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 (-\xi)  \mathcal{I}_5  \mathcal{I}_6  \, , \nonumber \\
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_1   = & \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 (-\xi)  \mathcal{I}_5 \mathcal{I}_6  \, , \quad
  && 4 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_2   =  \frac{\Omega_1 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 \xi^2  \mathcal{I}_6^2 \, , \nonumber \\
  4 \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 \left \langle B^a_{i} E^b_{j} \right \rangle_3   = & \frac{\Omega_2 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}}{ (2 \pi)^6} H^8 \xi^2 \mathcal{I}_3^2 \, , 
\end{align}
where we have also used $ef = -\xi/\tau$ and $\textrm{d}k k^2 = - \textrm{d}x_k x_k^2 /\tau^3 $. At this point we have all in hand to compute $ T_0 $, $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $. Let us start with $T_0$:
\begin{equation}
  T_0 = \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_1 + \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_2 + \left \langle E^a_{i} B^b_{j} \right \rangle_3 = - \frac{H^4}{4 \pi^2} e^{2 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \,  \left( \mathcal{I}_5 + \frac{\xi}{2} \mathcal{I}_3 - \xi \mathcal{I}_6 \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
which to a good approximation is given by
\begin{equation}
  T_0 = - 0.24 \times \frac{H^4}{4 \pi^2} \times \xi^3  e^{2 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}  \equiv   \frac{H^4}{4 \pi^2} \, e^{2 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}  \, \tilde T_0 \, .
\end{equation}
Analogously we can compute $T_1$ and $T_2$
\begin{align}
  T_1 & = \frac{\Omega_1 H^8}{ 4 (2\pi)^6} e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \  \mathcal{I}_1\left[ \mathcal{I}_2  + \xi^2 \mathcal{I}_3 - 2 \xi \mathcal{I}_4 \right]  \,, \\
T_2 & = \frac{\Omega_1 H^8}{ 4 (2\pi)^6} e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \ \left[\mathcal{I}_5^2 - 2 \xi \mathcal{I}_5 \mathcal{I}_6+ \xi^2 \mathcal{I}_6^2 + \xi^2 \Omega_2/\Omega_1 \mathcal{I}_3^2 \right]  \, .
\end{align}
Performing the integrals yields
\begin{align}
  T_1 & \simeq 0.0082 \times \frac{H^8}{80 \pi^4} \times \xi^8  e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)}  \equiv  \frac{H^8}{80 \pi^4} \,  e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \, \tilde T_1  \, , \\
  T_2 & \simeq 0.051 \times \frac{H^8}{80 \pi^4} \times  \xi^6 e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \equiv  \frac{H^8}{80 \pi^4} \,  e^{4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)} \, \tilde T_2  \, ,
\end{align}
where we have also substituted the values of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$.

\section{\label{app:sec3}Supplemental material for \prettyref{sec:background}}

In \prettyref{app:Jacobi} we describe the properties of the Jacobi $\sn$ function, which is used to describe the oscillatory regime for solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} for the homogeneous and isotropic gauge-field background. In \prettyref{app:pf-bg-future} we qualitatively describe the asymptotic behaviour of solutions in the infinite past and infinite future. \prettyref{app:t_to_0} gives asymptotic expansions for solutions in the infinite future, while \prettyref{app:pf-approx-w} proves asymptotics in the far past. Along the way, we prove the theorems stated in \prettyref{subsec:solutions}.

\subsection{\label{app:Jacobi}Solution of the quartic oscillator equation via the Jacobi \texorpdfstring{$\sn$}{sn} function}

In the case $\xi=0$ (or in the limit $\tau\to-\infty$ when the last term can be neglected), the equation of motion \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} is a quartic oscillator, which is solved by the Jacobi \texorpdfstring{$\sn$}{sn} function. We review some basic facts about this function while providing a derivation. Let $v(\tau)$ denote any solution to the $\xi=0$ version of \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. For comparison, let $h(\tau)$ be any solution to the harmonic oscillator equation. Then 
\begin{align}
v''(\tau)+2\left(v(\tau)\right)^{3} & =0, & h''(\tau)+h(\tau) & =0.\label{eq:jacobi-eom}
\end{align}
 Multiplying \prettyref{eq:jacobi-eom} by $2v'(\tau)$ and $2h'(\tau)$ respectively, after integration we obtain 
\begin{align}
v'(\tau)^{2}+v(\tau)^{4} & =\omega^{4}, & h'(\tau)^{2}+h(\tau)^{2} & =A^{2},\label{eq:jacobi-energy}
\end{align}
 where $\omega^{4}$ and $A^{2}$ are integration constants. We will identify $\omega$ and $A$ with the respective amplitudes of oscillation. Identifying the second terms on the left-hand sides of \eqref{eq:jacobi-energy} as twice the potential energy, we note that the first equation in \eqref{eq:jacobi-energy} describes a quartic oscillator. Separating variables and integrating, 
\begin{align}
\int\mathrm{d}\tau & =\int\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\sqrt{\omega^{4}-v^{4}}}, & \int\mathrm{d}\tau & =\int\frac{\mathrm{d}h}{\sqrt{A^{2}-h^{2}}}\nonumber \\
\tau+u_{0}/\omega & =F\left(\sin^{-1}\left(v/\omega\right)\mid-1\right)/\omega & \tau+\theta_{0} & =\sin^{-1}\left(h/A\right),\label{eq:elliptic-F}
\end{align}
 where $u_{0}/\omega$ and $\theta_{0}$ are constants of integration, and $F(\phi\mid m)\equiv\int_{0}^{\phi}\left(1-m\,\sin^{2}(\theta)\right)^{-1/2}\,\mathrm{d}\theta$ is the \emph{incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind} with \emph{elliptic parameter} $m$. For fixed $m$, the inverse function of $u=F(\phi\mid m)$ is defined as the \emph{Jacobi amplitude} $\phi=\am(u\mid m)$. Solving for $v(\tau)$ and $h(\tau)$ respectively, we obtain the general solution 
\begin{equation}
v(\tau)=\omega\,\sn\left(\omega\tau+u_{0}\mid-1\right),\qquad h(\tau)=A\,\sin\left(\tau+\theta_{0}\right),\label{eq:quartic-solution}
\end{equation}
 where $\sn(u\mid m)\equiv\sin\left(\am\left(u\mid m\right)\right)$. Since we will be concerned only with the case $m=-1$, we define as shorthand
\[
\sn(u)\equiv\sn(u\mid-1),\quad\sn'(u)\equiv\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}u}\sn(u\mid-1).
\]
 The functions $\sn(u)$ and $\sn'(u)$ both oscillate with unit amplitude and satisfy $\sn(0)=0$ and $\sn'(0)=1$. Just as the quarter-period of $\sin(\theta)$ is given by $\sin^{-1}(1)=\pi/2$, it follows from \prettyref{eq:elliptic-F} that the quarter-period of $\sn(u)$ is $K(-1)\approx5.244$, where $K(m)\equiv F(\sin^{-1}(1)\mid m)$ denotes the \emph{complete elliptic integral of the first kind}. From \prettyref{eq:jacobi-eom} and the $\omega=1$ version of \prettyref{eq:jacobi-energy}, we obtain the identities
\begin{equation}
\tfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}u}\sn'(u)=-2\sn(u)^{3},\qquad\sn'(u)^{2}+\sn(u)^{4}=1.\label{eq:sn-identities}
\end{equation}
 Note that the general solution \eqref{eq:quartic-solution} to \prettyref{eq:jacobi-eom} has amplitude $\omega$ and frequency $\tfrac{1}{4}\omega/K(-1)$. 

For any function $s(\tau)$, it will be useful to define the Jacobi version of polar coordinates in phase space. We introduce the radial coordinate $\omega_{s}(\tau)\geq0$ and the angular coordinate $u_{s}(\tau)$ according to 
\begin{equation}
\left(s(\tau),s'(\tau)\right)=\left(\omega_{s}(\tau)\sn(u_{s}(\tau)),\ \omega_{s}(\tau)^{2}\sn'(u_{s}(\tau))\right).\label{eq:polar-def}
\end{equation}
 It follows from the second identity in \eqref{eq:sn-identities} that 
\[
\omega_{s}(\tau)=\sqrt[4]{s'(\tau)^{2}+s(\tau)^{4}}.
\]
 Moreover if $s(\tau)$ satisfies an equation of the form $s''(\tau)+2s(\tau)^{3}=F(s(\tau),s'(\tau))$, then the corresponding polar equations are 
\begin{align}
\omega_{s}'(\tau)  =\frac{\sn'(u_{s}(\tau))}{2\omega_{s}(\tau)}F,  \qquad \qquad u_{s}'(\tau)  =\omega_{s}(\tau)-\frac{\sn(u_{s}(\tau))}{2\omega_{s}(\tau)^{2}}F, \nonumber \\
F  =F\left(\omega_{s}(\tau)\sn(u_{s}(\tau)),\ \omega_{s}(\tau)^{2}\sn'(u_{s}(\tau))\right).  \hspace{1.cm}  \label{eq:Jacobi-polar}
\end{align}
 In particular, if $F=0$ as in the case $s(\tau)=v(\tau)$ given in \prettyref{eq:jacobi-eom}, then $\omega_{v}'(\tau)=0$ and $u_{v}'(\tau)=\omega$, which agrees with \prettyref{eq:quartic-solution}. 

\subsection{\label{app:pf-bg-future}The limiting behaviour of solutions to the homogeneous background gauge-field equation in the infinite past and future}

Here we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the equations of motion \prettyref{eq:q-p-eom}. Solutions are given by trajectories of the vector field \eqref{eq:vec-field}, as pictured in \prettyref{fig:trajectories-panel}. In summary, we prove that the observations made in \prettyref{subsec:phase-space} are generally true. We consider two asymptotic limits: the infinite past ($N\to+\infty)$ and the infinite future\footnote{Although inflation ends at $N=0,$ it is still mathematically useful to analyze our background equation of motion by taking limits. The appropriate future limit corresponding to $\tau\to0^{-}$ is $N\to-\infty$. } $(N\to-\infty)$. As we shall see, Bendixson's criterion and the Poincar\'e--Bendixson theorem \cite{bendixson1901} allow us to give a complete classification of all trajectories. Namely, Bendixson's criterion rules out pathologies such as periodic or homoclinic\footnote{A \emph{homoclinic orbit} is a trajectory for which the same (saddle) point is the limit in both the infinite past and infinite future.} orbits, and then the Poincar\'e--Bendixson theorem implies that some limit exists, being either a zero of the vector field or $\bm{\infty}$.\footnote{We say that the limit of a trajectory is $\bm{\infty}$ when the magnitude of the trajectory limits to infinity. Equivalently, when $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is compactified to $S^{2}$ by adding a point denoted by $\bm{\infty}$, then the limit converges to $\bm{\infty}$. } Further use of Bendixson's criterion will allow us in \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table} to exactly count the number of trajectories as classified by their asymptotic limits.

The vector field \eqref{eq:vec-field} has at most three zeroes denoted $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$, and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ (see \eqref{eq:ci-points}). We will make use of the following readily-verified properties of the vector field \eqref{eq:vec-field}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The divergence $\nabla\cdot$ is strictly positive (the constant function $+3$). 
\item When $0\leq\xi<2$, there is a single zero at the point $\mathbf{c}_{0}$. When $\xi>2$ there are three zeroes at $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$. (To avoid irrelevant complications arising from degenerate zeroes\footnote{A zero of the vector field $V$ is \emph{degenerate} if its linearization $\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}$ at that zero is given by a matrix whose determinant is $0$.} of a vector field, we exclude from analysis the case when $\xi$ is exactly equal to $2$.) In either case, the zeroes are non-degenerate, and $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ is a saddle point while $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ are attractors (they arise as limit points in the infinite future $N\to-\infty$ but not in the infinite past $N\to+\infty$). 
\item Whenever it is positive, the auxiliary quantity $D(N)$ given by 
\begin{equation}
D(q,p)\equiv p^{2}+q^{4}-\tfrac{4}{3}\xi q^{3},\qquad D(N)\equiv D(q(N),p(N)),\label{eq:def-D}
\end{equation}
 is decreasing in time along trajectories. Namely by \prettyref{eq:q-p-eom}, it satisfies 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\mathrm{d}D}{\mathrm{d}N}=-3D-(p^{2}+q^{4})<0\ \textrm{ whenever }D>0.\label{eq:D-decreasing}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
To explain the significance of $D(N)$, note that 
\begin{equation}
\tau^{-4}D(N)=\left(ef'(\tau)\right)^{2}+\left(ef(\tau)\right)^{4}-\tfrac{4}{3}\xi(ef(\tau))^{3}/(-\tau)=\omega_{ef}(\tau)^{4}\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)}\right)\right).\label{eq:DN-asymptotic}
\end{equation}
 When $\tau\ll-\xi/\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ we have $D(N)\approx(\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau))^{4}$. Thus $D(N)$ encodes the approximate amplitude $\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ of oscillations while also satisfying the monotonicity property \eqref{eq:D-decreasing}.  
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:oscillation-condition}For a given trajectory, the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enu:inf-past-trajectory-infinity}The trajectory converges to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past.
\item \label{enu:inf-past--tomega-infinity}$-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)\to+\infty$ as $\tau\to-\infty$. 
\item \label{enu:inf-past-D-infinity}$D(N)\to+\infty$ as $N\to+\infty$. 
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, if $D(N)$ is bounded, then the trajectory is bounded.
\end{lem}

We will show later that these three conditions are also equivalent to $\omega>0$. 
\begin{proof}
Consider the limit in the infinite past. A trajectory converges to $\bm{\infty}$ if and only if $p^{2}+q^{4}\to+\infty$. Since $p^{2}+q^{4}=(-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau))^{4}$ it follows that items \ref{enu:inf-past-trajectory-infinity} and \ref{enu:inf-past--tomega-infinity} are equivalent. Supposing that $-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)\to+\infty$, it follows from \prettyref{eq:DN-asymptotic} that $D(N)\to+\infty$. One also sees from \prettyref{eq:DN-asymptotic} that $D(N)$ is large only when $-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ is. Thus item \ref{enu:inf-past-D-infinity} is also equivalent. Finally, if $D(N)$ is bounded, then $-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ is bounded and hence $p^{2}+q^{4}$ and thus the trajectory are bounded.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}[Bendixson's criterion]
\label{lem:Bendixson-criterion}The vector field \eqref{eq:vec-field} has no periodic trajectory. More generally, there are no bounded sets of positive area which are invariant under the flow of \eqref{eq:vec-field}. In particular, no finite union of bounded trajectories forms a loop.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since the divergence is $+3$, the area of any bounded set is proportional to $e^{3N}$ under the flow of \eqref{eq:vec-field}. Since the area of any invariant set must be constant under the flow, any bounded invariant set must have zero area. No periodic orbit is possible: the interior of the enclosed region would be bounded, positive area, and invariant. Similarly, the union of finitely many bounded trajectories cannot form any loop. This general argument goes back to \cite{bendixson1901}. 
\end{proof}
Note that \prettyref{lem:Bendixson-criterion} forbids loops formed by any bounded trajectories, regardless of the direction of the flow. Just as it is impossible to flow $\mathbf{a}\to\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b}\to\mathbf{a}$, it is also forbidden to flow $\mathbf{a}\to\mathbf{b}$ along two distinct trajectories, because the enclosed region would be invariant and have positive area. 
\begin{lem}[Poincar\'e--Bendixson theorem]
\label{lem:Poincare-Bendixson} In either limit $N\to\pm\infty$, any trajectory either converges to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ or $\mathbf{c}_{2}$, or the trajectory is unbounded. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
According to the Poincar\'e--Bendixson theorem \cite{bendixson1901}, given any smooth vector field on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ which has a finite number of non-degenerate zeroes, the limiting behaviour of any trajectory as $N\to+\infty$ or respectively as $N\to-\infty$ is given by one of the following five distinct possibilities: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enu:pb-zero}The trajectory limits to a zero of the vector field. 
\item \label{enu:pb-unbounded}The trajectory is unbounded. 
\item \label{enu:pb-periodic}The trajectory is periodic.
\item \label{enu:pb-almost-periodic}The trajectory spirals towards a periodic trajectory.
\item \label{enu:pb-broken}The trajectory spirals towards some limiting loop which is a union of finitely many trajectories which connect subsequent saddle-point zeroes of the vector field to each other. 
\end{enumerate}
In our case, Bendixson's criterion (\prettyref{lem:Bendixson-criterion}) applies. Thus \ref{enu:pb-periodic}, \ref{enu:pb-almost-periodic} and \ref{enu:pb-broken} are impossible, so \ref{enu:pb-zero} or \ref{enu:pb-unbounded} must be true. 
\end{proof}
The next two lemmas imply that $\bm{\infty}$ behaves as a repeller (it arises as a limit in the infinite past $N\to+\infty$ for all sufficiently large initial conditions, but it is never a limit in the infinite future).

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:D-unbounded} The forward evolution (in the direction $N\to-\infty$) of any trajectory converges to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ or $\mathbf{c}_{2}$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
For any trajectory beginning at $N_{0}$, consider $D(N)$ for values with $N\leq N_{0}$. Since $D(N)$ cannot be simultaneously positive and increasing with $-N$, it satisfies $D(N)\leq\max(0,D(N_{0}))$ for all $N\leq N_{0}$. Thus $D(N)$ is bounded in the future direction. It follows from \prettyref{lem:oscillation-condition} that the trajectory itself is bounded (see \prettyref{lem:oscillation-condition}), and thus \prettyref{lem:Poincare-Bendixson} implies that the limit is a zero of the vector field. 
\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:dichotomy}Every trajectory satisfies exactly one of the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enu:bounded-traj}$D(N)\leq0$ for all $N$, and the trajectory converges to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ or $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ in the infinite past.
\item \label{enu:conv-to-inf}The trajectory converges to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past, and $-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)\to+\infty$ as $\tau\to-\infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

We will see in \prettyref{lem:D-negative-omega-zero} that the first case corresponds to $\omega=0$, which consists of constant trajectories and, by \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table}, also the instanton-type trajectories. In \prettyref{lem:omega-positive} we will see that the second case corresponds to $\omega>0$, which are the solutions which oscillate in the far past.
\begin{proof}
If $D(N)\leq0$ for all $N$ then by \prettyref{lem:oscillation-condition} the trajectory is bounded, and hence by \prettyref{lem:Poincare-Bendixson} it converges to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$, $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ or $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ in the infinite past. For the remainder of the assertion, it suffices to show that if $D(N_{1})>0$ for some $N_{1}$ then $D(N)\to+\infty$ as $N\to\infty$, because then \prettyref{lem:oscillation-condition} implies \ref{enu:conv-to-inf}. From \prettyref{eq:D-decreasing}, it follows that $D(N)$ is increasing as $N$ increases for $N\geq N_{1}$. Thus either $D(N)\to+\infty$ or $D(N)$ increases to some finite positive limit. Suppose for contradiction that $D(N)$ increases to a finite positive limit. Then $D(N)$ and hence also the trajectory are bounded as $N\to\infty$. By \prettyref{lem:Poincare-Bendixson} it follows that the trajectory must limit to some $\mathbf{c}_{i}$. However, as is easily verified, $D(\mathbf{c}_{i})\leq0$ so this is impossible. In summary, if $D(N)\leq0$ then the trajectory is bounded and so \ref{enu:bounded-traj} holds. Otherwise there exists some $N_{1}$ such that $D(N_{1})>0$ from which it follows that $D(N)\to+\infty$, and \ref{enu:conv-to-inf} holds. 
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:D-negative-omega-zero}If $D(N_{1})\leq0$ then $\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau_{1})$, where $N_{1}$ and $\tau_{1}$ correspond to the same time. In particular, if $D(N)\leq0$ for all $N$, then $\omega=0$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
From \prettyref{eq:DN-asymptotic}, $D(N_{1})\leq0$ is equivalent to 
\[
\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})^{4}=\left(ef'(\tau_{1})\right)^{2}+\left(ef(\tau_{1})\right)^{4}\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi(ef(\tau_{1}))^{3}/(-\tau_{1}).
\]
 Thus 
\[
\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})^{4}\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})^{3}/(-\tau_{1})\implies\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau_{1}).
\]
 If this inequality holds for all $\tau$, then $\omega\equiv\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{ef}(\tau)=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:asymptotic-table}When $0\leq\xi<2$, all non-constant trajectories limit to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past and to $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ in the infinite future. If we identify trajectories which differ by a shift in $N$ so that each point $(q,p)$ belongs to a unique trajectory, then for $\xi>2$, the number of non-constant trajectories classified by their asymptotic behaviour is given by \prettyref{tab:asymptotic-classification}.

\caption{\label{tab:asymptotic-classification}Number of non-constant trajectories for $\xi>2$ as classified by their behaviour in the infinite past ($N\to+\infty)$ and the infinite future ($N\to-\infty$).}
\end{table}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
First assume that $\xi>2$. Then by Lemmas~\ref{lem:D-unbounded} and \ref{lem:dichotomy}, the limit in the infinite past or future of any trajectory exists and belongs to the set $\left\{ \mathbf{c}_{0},\mathbf{c}_{1},\mathbf{c}_{2},\bm{\infty}\right\} $. Since $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ are attractors, they cannot arise as $N\to+\infty$ except as constant trajectories. In \prettyref{lem:D-unbounded}, we showed that $\infty$ is not a limit as $N\to-\infty$. Thus the rows and columns listed in \prettyref{tab:asymptotic-classification} correspond to all possibilities. 

Now we deduce the values listed in \prettyref{tab:asymptotic-classification}. Since $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ is a saddle point, exactly two trajectories limit to $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ as $N\to+\infty$ (resp. $N\to-\infty$). We call the pair converging to $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ as $N\to+\infty$ the ``instanton-type trajectories'' and to $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ as $N\to-\infty$ the ``$c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type trajectories.'' First consider the possibility that a trajectory is simultaneously an instanton-type and $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type trajectory. No non-constant trajectory can limit to $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ both as $N\to+\infty$ and $N\to-\infty$ since that would form a loop, which is forbidden by Bendixson's criterion (\prettyref{lem:Bendixson-criterion}). Thus the only simultaneously instanton-type and $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type trajectory is constant, so the corresponding table entry is $0$. Since the middle column corresponds to $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, of which there are two, the remaining table entry must be $2$, and thus both $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions must converge to $\bm{\infty}$ as $N\to+\infty$. Next we consider the two instanton-type solutions which correspond to the bottom row of the table. It is impossible for any entry in the bottom row to be $2$, because that would lead to a loop. Therefore the remaining two entries along the bottom row must be $1$. Finally, since $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ are attractors, infinitely many trajectories limit to them as $N\to-\infty$. Since the corresponding columns must sum to $\infty$, the remaining two entries must be $\infty$. 

In order to deduce the result for the case $\xi<2$, note that the $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$ points do not exist, so the corresponding version of \prettyref{tab:asymptotic-classification} collapses to the single entry in the upper-left. 
\end{proof}
The previous lemmas lead easily to the proof of \prettyref{thm:bg-future} and \prettyref{thm:phase-intervals}:
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prettyref{thm:bg-future}]
\label{pf:bg-future} We must show that $\lim_{\tau\to0^{-}}-\tau\,ef(\tau)=c_{i}\xi$ for some $c_{i}$, and that $\lim_{\lambda\to0^{+}}\lambda\,ef(\lambda\tau)=c_{i}\xi/(-\tau)$. For the former, 
\[
\lim_{\tau\to0^{-}}-\tau\,ef(\tau)=\lim_{N\to-\infty}q(N)=c_{i}\xi,
\]
 where $q(\tau)$ is defined in \eqref{eq:cov}, the change of variables to $N$ is defined in \eqref{eq:g-def}, and the last equality follows from \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table}: the trajectory limits to one of the points $\mathbf{c}_{i}$, and the $q$-coordinate of $\mathbf{c}_{i}$ is equal to $c_{i}\xi$ by \eqref{eq:ci-points}. Finally, 
\[
\lim_{\lambda\to0^{+}}\lambda\,ef(\lambda\tau)=(-\tau)^{-1}\lim_{\lambda\to0^{+}}q(N+\ln\lambda)=c_{i}\xi/(-\tau).
\]
 
\end{proof}
%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prettyref{thm:phase-intervals}]
 Fix any real number $C>0$. For any fixed $\xi>2$, we first observe that the set of all trajectories (modulo shifts in $N$) which limit to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past is parameterized by the level set $\left\{ (q,p)\mid D(q,p)=C\right\} $, which is topologically a circle. In particular, each trajectory must intersect this level set exactly once. This is because $D$ is decreasing in time when positive, $D(N)\to+\infty$ in the infinite past, and by \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table}, $D(N)\to D(\mathbf{c}_{i})\leq0$ for some $\mathbf{c}_{i}$ in the infinite future. Also from \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table}, exactly two trajectories of this type correspond to $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions. The non-constant $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions comprise the remaining points, which topologically are two disjoint open intervals. Since $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions are basins of attraction for the attractors $\mathbf{c}_{0}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{2}$, they are open subsets of the $q$-$p$ plane. Thus their intersections with the level set are non-empty open subsets of the circle. The only way to partition two disjoint intervals into two non-empty open subsets is when each subset corresponds to an interval. Thus the two points on the circle corresponding to $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions divide the complement of the circle into two open intervals of respective $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions. 

The phase $u_{0}$ also gives a continuous parameterization of all trajectories (modulo shifts in $N$), and it can be shown that $u_{0}$ parameterizes each level set. Thus for each fixed $\xi>2$, there are two phases corresponding to $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions, and the two complementary phase intervals correspond to intervals of respective $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\label{app:t_to_0}Asymptotics for the general solution of the background gauge field equations in the infinite future (\texorpdfstring{$\tau\to0^-$}{\tau\to0-}) }

We provide here a complete description of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} as $\tau\to0^{-}$. According to \prettyref{thm:bg-future}, for any fixed $\xi$, the limit 
\[
\lim_{\tau\to0^{-}}-\tau\,ef(\tau)
\]
achieves at most three distinct values as $ef(\tau)$ ranges over all solutions: $c_{i}\xi$ for $i\in\left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $, where $c_{i}$ is defined in \prettyref{eq:c-definitions}. In this way, each solution falls into one of three families: two two-parameter families ($c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type and $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type) and a one-parameter family ($c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type). For each of these three families we provide the leading terms of an asymptotic series solution to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} around $\tau=0$ from which all the parameters can be determined. For brevity, we omit the degenerate case $\xi=2$. The following expressions can be verified by substituting them into \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final}. Higher-order expressions can be derived by the method of undetermined coefficients.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The $c_{0}$\nobreakdash-type solutions with parameters $\beta$ and $\eta$ are 
\[
ef(\tau)=\beta+2\xi\beta^{2}\cdot(-\tau)\ln(-\tau)+\eta\cdot(-\tau)+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\xi^{2}\left|\beta^{3}\ln(-\tau)\right|+\xi\eta^{2}\right)(-\tau)^{2}\right)\ \mathrm{as}\ \tau\to0^{-}.
\]
 Under the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3}, the parameters transform as $(\beta,\eta)\mapsto(\lambda\beta,\lambda^{2}(\eta+2\xi\beta^{2}\ln\lambda)).$
\item The $c_{1}$\nobreakdash-type solutions with the single parameter $\rho$ are 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=\frac{c_{1}\xi}{-\tau}\left(1+\rho\left(-\tau\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}\left(3+\sqrt{d_{1}}\right)}+\mathcal{O}\left(\rho^{2}\left(-\tau\right)^{3+\sqrt{d_{1}}}\right)\right)\ \mathrm{as}\ \tau\to0^{-},\label{eq:c1-family}
\end{equation}
 where 
\[
d_{1}=25-8c_{1}\xi^{2}.
\]
 As $\xi$ increases from $2$ to $\infty$, $\sqrt{d_{1}}$ increases from $3$ to $\sqrt{17}$. The parameter $\rho$ transforms under \eqref{eq:symmetry3} as $\rho\mapsto\lambda^{\tfrac{1}{2}\left(3+\sqrt{d_{1}}\right)}\rho$. 
\item The $c_{2}$\nobreakdash-type solutions when\footnote{If $2<\xi<\sqrt{\frac{625}{136}}$ then the square root is negative, so \prettyref{eq:c2-sol} must be rewritten in overdamped form. The case $\xi=\sqrt{\frac{625}{136}}$ corresponds to critical damping. Qualitatively, the only difference in these cases is that the perturbations around the $c_{2}$ solution decay without oscillating. } $\xi>\sqrt{\frac{625}{136}}\approx2.14$ with parameters $\upsilon$ and $\theta$ are of the form 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=\frac{c_{2}\xi}{-\tau}\left(1+\nu(-\tau)^{3/2}\cos\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{-d_{2}}\ln(-\tau)+\theta\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(\nu^{2}(-\tau)^{3}\right)\right)\ \mathrm{as}\ \tau\to0^{-},\label{eq:c2-sol}
\end{equation}
 where 
\[
d_{2}:=25-8c_{2}\,\xi^{2}.
\]
 The parameters transform under \eqref{eq:symmetry3} as $(\nu,\theta)\mapsto(\lambda^{3/2}\nu,\theta+\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{-d_{2}}\ln(\lambda))$. 
\end{enumerate}
In accordance with \prettyref{thm:bg-future}, it is clear from these formulas and the corresponding transformation laws for the parameters that in the limit $\lambda\to0$ of \eqref{eq:symmetry3} (corresponding to the infinite future), we recover the respective $c_{i}$-solutions $ef(\tau)=c_{i}\xi/(-\tau)$. Note that in this same limit the error terms also vanish, and so these asymptotic formulas become exact.

Closely related to the $c_{1}$ solutions are the instanton-type solutions 
\begin{equation}
ef(\tau)=\frac{c_{1}\xi}{-\tau}\left(1+\rho\left(-\tau\right)^{\tfrac{1}{2}\left(3+\sqrt{d_{1}}\right)}+\mathcal{O}\left(\rho^{2}\left(-\tau\right)^{3+\sqrt{d_{1}}}\right)\right)\label{eq:instanton-type}
\end{equation}
 which are vacuum-to-vacuum transitions which tunnel from the $c_{1}$ solution in the infinite past to either the $c_{0}$ solution or $c_{2}$ solution in the infinite future.

\subsection{\label{app:pf-approx-w}Convergence of \texorpdfstring{$ef(\tau)$}{ef(\tau)} to the Jacobi \texorpdfstring{$\sn$}{sn} function in the far past}

In this subsection, we prove \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} by studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to \prettyref{eq:chromonatural_eom_final} as $\tau\to-\infty$. 

As is visible from the envelope of solutions shown in \prettyref{fig:omega_eq_1}, the mean value of the oscillations is slightly positive, and decaying to zero. To very good approximation, this mean value is given by $\xi/(-3\tau)$ as $\tau\to-\infty$. This is verified by defining $s(\tau)$ with this value subtracted from $ef(\tau)$: 
\begin{equation}
s(\tau)\equiv ef(\tau)-\xi/(-3\tau),\label{eq:def-s}
\end{equation}
 We compare the equations of motion for $ef(\tau)$ and $s(\tau)$: 
\begin{equation}
(ef)''(\tau)+2\left(ef(\tau)\right)^{3}=\frac{2\,\xi}{-\tau}(ef(\tau))^{2}\implies s''(\tau)+2s(\tau)^{3}=\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(1+\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau s(\tau)}\right)\right)s(\tau).\label{eq:s-eom}
\end{equation}
The right-hand sides can be viewed as forcing terms of the quartic oscillator. The forcing term for $ef(\tau)$ decays in proportion to $(-\tau)^{-1}$, while the forcing term for $s(\tau)$ decays faster as $\tau^{-2}$. Thus the Jacobi $\sn$ function approximates $s(\tau)$ to higher order as $\tau\to-\infty$. Indeed, this allows us to prove asymptotics by switching to Jacobi polar coordinates for $s(\tau)$. 

We shall compute $\omega$ by taking the limit of $\omega_{s}(\tau)$ in the asymptotic past. First we show that working with $\omega_{s}(\tau)$ yields the correct result:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:omega-ef-equivalent-to-omega-s}If either $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ or $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{s}(\tau)$ exists, then both limits exist and equal $\omega$. Furthermore, $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau)=+\infty$ if and only if $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)=+\infty$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $\omega$ is by definition the first limit. Expanding out using the definitions, $\omega_{ef}(\tau)^{4}-\omega_{s}(\tau)^{4}=\mathcal{O}(\xi\omega_{ef}(\tau)^{3}/(-\tau))$, and symmetrically $\omega_{ef}(\tau)^{4}-\omega_{s}(\tau)^{4}=\mathcal{O}(\xi\omega_{s}(\tau)^{3}/(-\tau))$. If either limit exists, then the respective asymptotic estimate shows that the difference of the limits vanishes. A similar argument applied to the ratio $-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)/(-\tau\omega_{ef}(\tau))\to1$ proves the last assertion. 
\end{proof}
In order to estimate $\omega_{s}(\tau)$ and $u_{s}(\tau)$, we use their differential equations. Substituting \prettyref{eq:s-eom} into \prettyref{eq:Jacobi-polar}, 
\begin{align}
\omega_{s}'(\tau) & =\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(\sn(u_{s}(\tau))+\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)}\right)\right)\sn'(u_{s}(\tau)),\label{eq:omega-eom}\\
u_{s}'(\tau) & =\omega_{s}(\tau)\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)}\right)^{2}\left(\sn(u_{s}(\tau))^{2}+\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\frac{\xi\sn(u_{s}(\tau))}{-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)}\right)\right).\label{eq:u-eom}
\end{align}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:omega-s}The numbers $\omega$ and $u_{0}\equiv\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\left(u_{s}(\tau)-\omega\tau\right)$ are well-defined. If $\omega=0$ then $\omega_{ef}(\tau)\leq\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau)$ for all $\tau$. If $\omega>0$ then 
\begin{align*}
\omega_{s}(\tau_{2}) & =\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)\right)\omega,\ \textrm{ and } & u_{s}(\tau)= & \omega\tau+u_{0}+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{2}/(-\omega\tau))\ \textrm{ as }\tau\to-\infty.
\end{align*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
In what follows, we prove several lemmas which, when taken together, imply this result. According to \prettyref{lem:omega-ef-equivalent-to-omega-s}, we can replace $\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ with $\omega_{s}(\tau)$. We already know from \prettyref{lem:dichotomy} that there are two cases to consider: either $D\leq0$ for all $\tau$ or $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)=+\infty$. \prettyref{lem:D-negative-omega-zero} showed that the former case leads to $\omega=0$ with the desired estimate. For the remainder, it suffices to assume $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)=+\infty$. Under this assumption, we prove in \prettyref{lem:ws-limit-exists} that $\omega$ exists, in \prettyref{lem:omega-positive} that $\omega>0$, and the desired estimates in \prettyref{lem:omega-s-estimate} and \prettyref{lem:u0-error}. 
\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:ws-limit-exists}In the case $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)=+\infty$, the number $\omega\equiv\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{ef}(\tau)$ is well-defined.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
By \prettyref{lem:omega-ef-equivalent-to-omega-s}, it suffices to show that $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{s}(\tau)$ converges. This is equivalent to showing that for all $\tau_{1}\leq\tau_{2}$, 
\[
\left|\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})-\omega_{s}(\tau_{1})\right|\to0\textrm{ as }\tau_{2}\to-\infty.
\]
 We can estimate the difference $\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})-\omega_{s}(\tau_{1})=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\omega_{s}'(\tau)\,\mathrm{d}\tau$ by using the differential equation \eqref{eq:omega-eom}. Since $\left|\sn(u)\right|\leq1$ and $\left|\sn'(u)\right|\leq1$, 
\[
\left|\omega_{s}'(\tau)\right|\leq\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(1+\left|\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right|\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)}\right)\right).
\]
 Since $-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)\to\infty$ as $\tau\to-\infty$, for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\tau_{*}$ such that for all $\tau\leq\tau_{*},$ 
\[
\left|\omega_{s}'(\tau)\right|\leq\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(1+\epsilon\right).
\]
 Here we choose $\tau_{*}$ corresponding to $\epsilon=2$. It follows that for any $\tau_{1}\leq\tau_{2}\leq\tau_{*}$, 
\[
\left|\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})-\omega_{s}(\tau_{1})\right|\leq\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left|\omega_{s}'(\tau)\right|\,\mathrm{d}\tau\leq\frac{\xi^{2}}{-\tau_{2}}\to0\ \textrm{ as }\ensuremath{\tau_{2}\to-\infty}.
\]
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:omega-positive}If $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)=+\infty$ then $\omega>0$ and the function $s(\tau)$ is $\mathcal{O}(\omega)$ as $\tau\to-\infty$. 
\end{lem}

Suppose for contradiction that $\omega=0$. Then the proof of \prettyref{lem:ws-limit-exists} gives 
\[
-\tau_{2}\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})=-\tau_{2}\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})-\tau_{2}\omega=-\tau_{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{2}}\omega_{s}'(\tau)\,\mathrm{d}\tau\leq\xi^{2},
\]
 which contradicts $-\tau\omega_{s}(\tau)\to+\infty$. Thus $\omega>0$. In this case, $\left|s(\tau)\right|\leq2\omega$ for sufficiently negative $\tau$. Thus $s(\tau)$ is $\mathcal{O}(\omega)$. 
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:omega-s-estimate}If $\omega>0$ then 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{s}(\tau)=\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau^{2}}\right)\right)\omega\ \textrm{ as }\tau\to-\infty.\label{eq:omega-quadratic-asymptotic}
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
For this proof it is easier not to use polar coordinates. We need the identity 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\omega_{s}(\tau)^{4}=2s'(\tau)\left(s''(\tau)+2s(\tau)^{3}\right)=\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(s(\tau)^{2}\right)'+\frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{3}s'(\tau),
\]
 which follows from \prettyref{eq:s-eom}. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, 
\begin{align*}
\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})^{4}-\omega^{4} & =\int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\omega_{s}(\tau)^{4}\,\mathrm{d}\tau=\int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{2}\left(s(\tau)^{2}\right)'+\frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\xi}{-\tau}\right)^{3}s'(\tau)\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau\\
 & =\frac{2\xi^{2}s(\tau_{2})^{2}}{3\tau_{2}^{2}}+\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\frac{4\xi^{3}s(\tau_{2})}{-3\tau_{2}^{3}}-\int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\frac{4\xi^{2}s(\tau)^{2}}{-3\tau{}^{3}}+\left(\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\right)\frac{4\xi^{3}s(\tau)}{\tau^{4}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau,
\end{align*}
 where the last equality follows from integration by parts. From \prettyref{lem:omega-positive} we obtain 
\[
\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})^{4}-\omega^{4}=\omega^{4}\left(\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)+\int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{2}}\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{-\omega^{2}\tau^{3}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau\right)=\omega^{4}\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right).
\]
 Solving for $\omega_{s}(\tau_{2})$ and using $\sqrt[4]{1+\epsilon}=1+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon\right)$, we obtain \prettyref{eq:omega-quadratic-asymptotic}.  
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:u0-error}If $\omega>0$ then the limit $u_{0}\equiv\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\left(u_{s}(\tau)-\omega\tau\right)$ is well-defined (modulo the period of $\sn$), and $u_{s}(\tau)=\omega\tau+u_{0}+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{2}/(-\omega\tau)).$ 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
From \prettyref{eq:u-eom}, 
\[
u_{s}'(\tau)=\omega\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)\right)\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)\right)=\omega\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)\right).
\]
 Thus if $\tau_{1}\leq\tau_{2},$ then 
\[
\left|(u(\tau_{2})-\omega\tau_{2})-(u(\tau_{1})-\omega\tau_{1})\right|=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega\tau_{2}^{2}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{-\omega\tau_{2}}\right).
\]
 Since this approaches zero as $\tau_{2}\to-\infty$, the limit $u_{0}$ exists, and the claimed asymptotic holds.  
\end{proof}
%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prettyref{thm:oscillatory}]
\label{pf:oscillatory} To show that $(\omega,u_{0})\mapsto(\lambda\omega,u_{0})$, one applies the transformation \eqref{eq:symmetry3} to \prettyref{eq:approx-quartic}. It remains to prove the error estimate. From the definitions \eqref{eq:def-s} of $s(\tau)$ and \eqref{eq:polar-def} of Jacobi polar coordinates, 
\[
ef(\tau)=\xi/(-3\tau)+s(\tau)=\omega_{s}(\tau)\sn(u_{s}(\tau))+\mathcal{O}(\xi/(-\tau))\ \textrm{ as }\tau\to-\infty.
\]
 Note that since $\sn'(u)$ is bounded, it follows that $\sn(u+\epsilon)=\sn(u)+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. Combining this with the estimates of \prettyref{thm:omega-s}, 
\begin{align*}
ef(\tau) & =\omega\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\xi^{2}}{\omega^{2}\tau^{2}}\right)\right)\left(\sn(\omega\tau+u_{0})+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{2}/(-\omega\tau))\right)+\mathcal{O}(\xi/(-\tau))\\
 & =\omega\sn(\omega\tau+u_{0})+\mathcal{O}((\xi+\xi^{2})/(-\tau)),
\end{align*}
 as desired. 
\end{proof}
%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prettyref{thm:approx-w}]
\label{pf:approx-w} The parameter $\omega$ which appeared in the proof of \prettyref{thm:oscillatory} was indeed the same $\omega$ defined as $\lim_{\tau\to-\infty}\omega_{ef}(\tau)$. In order to show that $\omega>0$ for the two given cases, by \prettyref{lem:oscillation-condition} and \prettyref{lem:omega-positive} it suffices to show that the trajectory converges to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past. In the case $0\leq\xi<2$, \prettyref{lem:asymptotic-table} implies that all non-zero trajectories limit to $\bm{\infty}$ in the infinite past, and $\omega_{ef}(\tau)>0$ implies that the trajectory is nonzero. For general $\xi$, if $\omega_{ef}(\tau_{1})>\tfrac{4}{3}\xi/(-\tau_{1})$ then \prettyref{lem:D-negative-omega-zero} implies that $D(N_{1})>0$, and then \prettyref{lem:dichotomy} implies that the trajectory limits to $\bm{\infty}$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Introduction}

The simplest models of low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) as a solution to the hierarchy problem
are in tension with the latest LHC results (see e.g.~\cite{Craig:2013cxa} and references therein)
which are moving the bounds for sparticle masses beyond the TeV scale. We are then either in a situation where we accept two to three orders of magnitude of tuning as still `natural', or we are at a very particular corner in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) parameter space with less fine-tuning (e.g.~natural SUSY~\cite{Kitano:2005ew,Papucci:2011wy,Brust:2011tb}, compressed spectra~\cite{Lebedev:2005ge,LeCompte:2011cn},
RPV models~\cite{Allanach:2012vj,Evans:2012bf}), or we need alternatives to the conventional MSSM. Given this, there are various avenues to explore for addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The simplest MSSM models (e.g.~CMSSM) need to be modified at low energies to account for particular corners in the MSSM parameter space with reduced fine-tuning. Or, one step further, extensions of the MSSM including extra matter and/or interactions at the TeV scale may relax the tuning of the MSSM (see e.g.~\cite{Ross:2012nr}).
\item The MSSM is the correct description for beyond the Standard Model (SM) physics
but the hierarchy problem is addressed by different amounts of fine-tuning through the multiverse just like the cosmological constant problem \cite{Bousso:2000xa}, where we can distinguish the following classes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The simplest models of low energy SUSY are realised with some two to three orders magnitude of fine-tuning.
\item One just keeps the appealing features of low-energy SUSY of realising the correct dark matter density and gauge coupling unification whereas the hierarchy problem is no longer addressed. This proposal is commonly referred to as split SUSY \cite{ArkaniHamed:2004fb} where gauginos are at the TeV scale while the scalar superpartners are hierarchically heavier.
\item Dark matter and gauge coupling unification are achieved by other mechanisms and the SUSY particles are at a scale far above the electroweak scale such as an intermediate scale.
\end{enumerate}
\item One can consider alternative solutions to the hierarchy problem such as composite models or extra-dimensional models.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these scenarios has its own virtues and demerits. The first one aims at avoiding fine-tuning in the parameter space of the MSSM, but without a principle on why to favour a particular extension in a UV theory, it is in some sense a tuning in theory space which is as appealing as fine-tuning in parameter space, the others simply accept some sort of tuning.\footnote{Particular interesting corners of parameter space for soft-terms can be obtained by invoking principles such as precision gauge coupling unification~\cite{Krippendorf:2013dqa} or by identifying pattern in underlying UV theories (e.g.~realisation of natural SUSY and compressed spectra in the heterotic mini-landscape~\cite{Krippendorf:2012ir,Badziak:2012yg}).} Given this state of affairs, we are left with the unpleasant situation that at present the best argument
in favour of low-energy SUSY is that other alternatives, like large extra dimensions or composite models, are looking even worse.

This is a golden opportunity for string theoretical scenarios to play a role.
Being the only explicit scenarios that provide a UV completion of the SM,
they should be able to address the problems of the scenarios mentioned above,
provide guidance towards their explicit realisation and maybe even suggest other alternative avenues.

Consistent string theories are typically supersymmetric. Unfortunately, low-energy SUSY or the MSSM
are not a prediction of string theory and its potential discovery or lack of will not directly test string theory.
Moreover for a high string scale of order $10^{16}$~GeV (as hinted by standard MSSM unification and recent inflationary observations \cite{Ade:2014xna}),
obtaining at the same time low-energy SUSY can be a challenge for model building.
Another important feature is the string landscape which can potentially have an impact on the hierarchy problem.
These are very important issues which can impact LHC and future collider observations. They need to be addressed systematically
and within a complete string framework. This is the subject of the present article.

Fortunately progress in the understanding of SUSY breaking in string compactifications is maturing right on time to play a role.
Several scenarios in which most of the string moduli have been stabilised
with SUSY breaking and computable soft-terms have emerged~\cite{Choi:2005ge,Nilles:1997cm,Conlon:2006us,Conlon:2006wz, Lowen:2008fm, deAlwis:2009fn, Cicoli:2013rwa,Acharya:2008zi}.
Some of them are also consistent with cosmological constraints such as the cosmological moduli problem (CMP) and the realisation of de Sitter (dS) vacua.
In particular, the LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS)~\cite{Balasubramanian:2005zx}, on which we focus in this article,
allows for several of the above SUSY breaking scenarios in which soft-terms can be explicitly computed.
Moreover, LVS is an ideal framework to build globally consistent MSSM-like chiral models for explicit
Calabi-Yau (CY) compactifications with all closed string moduli stabilised~\cite{Cicoli:2011qg,Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2013mpa,Cicoli:2013cha}.
It is also possible to obtain dS vacua from supersymmetric effective actions \cite{Cicoli:2012fh,Cicoli:2012vw} and the string landscape allows for a controllable fine-tuning of the cosmological constant and potentially the electroweak hierarchy problem.

\subsection{SUSY breaking in LVS}

Let us briefly summarise the main properties of LVS relevant for soft SUSY breaking:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Closed string moduli stabilisation:} Complex structure moduli and the dilaton
are fixed by three-form fluxes at a supersymmetric minimum. The degeneracy associated with the flux quanta leads to a landscape of vacua.
The non-vanishing value of the flux superpotential $W_0$ at the minimum breaks SUSY.
Perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the tree-level effective action
fix the K\"ahler moduli at sizes larger than the string scale (as required to control the $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ expansions).
The Einstein-frame volume ${V}$ is exponentially large in string units: ${V}\sim e^{1/g_s}$ ($g_s$ is the string coupling).

\item{\it Hierarchy of scales:} LVS leads to a hierarchy of scales for masses and soft-terms \cite{Conlon:2005ki}.
In Planck units ($M_P$ is the reduced Planck mass), the string scale is (see Appendix~A of \cite{Conlon:2005ki} for the derivation of the exact prefactors)
\begin{equation}
M_s = \frac{g_s^{1/4} M_P}{\sqrt{4\pi{V}}}\,,
\label{Ms}
\end{equation}
the Kaluza-Klein scale is
\begin{equation}
M_\KK\simeq \frac{M_P}{\sqrt{4\pi}{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\label{MKK}
\end{equation}
and the gravitino mass is\footnote{We set the VEV of the K\"ahler potential for complex structure moduli such that $e^{{K_{\rm cs}}/2}=1$.}
\begin{equation}
m_{3/2} = e^{K/2} |W|= \left(\frac{g_s^2}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}\right) \frac{W_0 M_P}{{V}} +\ldots\, ,
\label{m32}
\end{equation}
where the dots indicate suppressed corrections in the inverse volume expansion.
Most of the moduli receive a mass of order $m_{3/2}$ except for the volume mode whose mass is
$m_{V} \simeq m_{3/2}/\sqrt{{V}}$. Hence there is a natural hierarchy of scales $M_s\gg M_\KK\gg m_{3/2}\gg m_{V}$
for the flux superpotential $W_0$ taking generic values between $1-100$.

\item {\it Bottom-up model building:} The D-brane configuration of the visible sector is localised in a particular corner
of the bulk geometry, allowing for a realisation of the bottom-up approach to string model building~\cite{Aldazabal:2000sa}.
The structure of soft-terms does not depend on the gauge theory realised in the visible sector but only on the type of D-brane configuration
(e.g. branes at singularities, D7-branes in the geometric regime) as in the modular approach to string model building.
The realisation of the visible sector on a cycle different from the one supporting non-perturbative effects allows to achieve compatibility of chirality and moduli stabilisation~\cite{Blumenhagen:2007sm,Cicoli:2011qg}.

\item {\it SUSY breaking:} Assuming a D-brane configuration that leads to the MSSM,
the effective field theory allows to analyse the structure of soft-masses.
In particular, the pattern of soft masses depends on the location and type of the MSSM D-brane construction
in the CY orientifold compactification.
If the MSSM is located at a divisor geometrically separated from the main sources of SUSY breaking in the bulk,
e.g.~on a shrinking divisor, there can be a hierarchical suppression of the soft masses below the gravitino mass and the lightest modulus~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}. If the dominant source of SUSY breaking is in the proximity of the visible sector brane configuration
(as it happens if the F-term of the modulus of the cycle wrapped by the SM brane breaks SUSY),
the soft masses are of order the gravitino mass with only mild suppressions~\cite{Conlon:2005ki, Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm,Shin:2011uk}.
\end{itemize}

Generically moduli masses tend to be of order the gravitino mass.
In view of the CMP which sets a lower bound on moduli masses of order $50$ TeV~\cite{Coughlan:1983ci,Banks:1993en,deCarlos:1993jw},
it is often desirable to have soft masses well below the gravitino/moduli masses
although achieving this requires a special mechanism at play. We will refer to models which have hierarchically suppressed soft masses
(not just by loop factors) as sequestered models.\footnote{A similar suppression appears also in the context of realisations of the KKLT scenario~\cite{Choi:2005ge}.}
Depending on the location of SM particles and the value of the CY volume, we distinguish three interesting LVS scenarios for SUSY breaking:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Unsequestered GUT scale string models:}
Motivated by unification, if one takes the string scale to be close to the GUT scale $10^{14}-10^{16}$ GeV, where the range in the volume captures the uncertainty about high-scale threshold corrections,
then the volume is of order ${V}\simeq 10^{3}-10^{7}$ for $g_s\simeq 0.1$.
This implies a large gravitino mass, $m_{3/2}\simeq 10^{10}-10^{14}$ GeV, i.e.~unobservable sparticles,
unless the flux superpotential is tuned to extremely small values (tuning of up to $W_0\sim 10^{-10}$)
to get TeV soft-terms.\footnote{TeV scale soft masses in this scenario would lead to light moduli
which suffer from the CMP since $m_{V} \simeq 10$ GeV.}
So the generic situation without tuning $W_0$ is that soft-terms are at an intermediate scale, roughly in the range $10^{10}-10^{14}$ GeV which is the option 2c) described earlier.
This scenario is safe from the CMP. The string landscape can in principle address the hierarchy problem.

\item{\bf Unsequestered intermediate scale strings:}
Requiring TeV scale soft-terms in an unsequestered setting leads to a volume of order ${V}\simeq 10^{14}$ for $W_0\sim 10$,
implying an intermediate string scale, $M_s\simeq 5\cdot 10^{10}$ GeV.
This scenario addresses the hierarchy problem, although unification has to work differently from the MSSM (see \cite{Aldazabal:2000sk, 1106.6039,Cicoli:2013mpa}
for concrete string examples with intermediate scale unification). Its spectrum of soft-terms at the electroweak scale has been studied in \cite{Conlon:2007xv}.
It suffers from the CMP since the volume modulus mass is slightly below 1 MeV.

\item{\bf Sequestered high scale string models:}
There can be special situations in which the soft-terms are hierarchically smaller than the gravitino mass, referred to as
sequestered scenarios~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}.
In LVS this happens in configurations in which the SM degrees of freedom are localised in the extra dimensions,
such as in models where the visible sector arises from open strings on D3-branes at a singularity.
In particular, in this setup the F-term of the SM cycle vanishes and the dominant F-terms are associated with other moduli
(the volume modulus, the dilaton and other K\"ahler and complex structure moduli).
However the dominant F-terms couple very weakly to the visible sector because of their bulk separation,
and this produces a hierarchy between the soft-terms and the gravitino mass.
Typically gaugino masses are of order $M_{1/2}\simeq m_{3/2}/{V}$,
whereas scalar masses can be as suppressed as the gaugino masses or hierarchically larger by a power ${V}^{1/2}$
(leading to a split SUSY scenario in this last case).
This makes these models very attractive for phenomenology since they feature TeV scale soft-terms
and no CMP for ${V}\simeq 10^7$ and $W_0\simeq 50$ which give
$M_{1/2}\simeq 1$~TeV, $m_{3/2}\simeq 10^{10}$ GeV and $m_{V} \simeq 5\cdot 10^6$ GeV. The unification scale in these models is set by
the winding scale $M_W = 2 \pi\sqrt{\pi g_s} M_P / {V}^{1/3}$ \cite{Conlon:2009xf,Conlon:2009kt} which turns out to be of the same order of the standard GUT scale. The appearance of this hierarchical suppression of soft masses is subject to the structure of the effective supergravity. Changes to the EFT at loop or non-perturbative level (see for instance~\cite{Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm, Berg:2010ha, Conlon:2011jq,Berg:2012aq}) can lead to desequestering. In Appendix~\ref{sec:deseq} we comment more explicitly on possible sources for desequestering and focus for the remainder of this paper on constructions where these desequestering effects can be absent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}

In this paper our focus shall be on the last of the three scenarios described above: sequestered models.
In~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} it was realised that soft-terms
can potentially be sensitive to the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS minimum.
Lack of a controlled understanding of the way to get dS vacua made it difficult to present a complete analysis of the SUSY phenomenology.
Recently there has been progress in obtaining dS vacua from supersymmetric effective actions~\cite{Cicoli:2012fh,Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2013mpa,Cicoli:2013cha,Krippendorf:2009zza}. In this paper we work out this dependence on the uplifting mechanism in sequestered models. As previously, we assume an MSSM spectrum from the local D-brane configuration for simplicity.
To perform the lengthy soft-term computations we have developed a code called \texttt{Large$\mathcal{V}$ol}.\footnote{\texttt{Large$\mathcal{V}$ol} is
a Mathematica Package useful to analyse the phenomenology of various type IIB supergravity theories.
It computes and minimises the scalar potential following the LVS mechanism for moduli fixing.
\texttt{Large${V}$ol} can calculate F-terms and soft-terms generated via both supergravity and anomaly mediation.}

We explicitly compute all soft-terms for sequestered scenarios
identifying different cases depending on the mechanism to obtain dS vacua and the moduli-dependence of
the K\"ahler metric for matter fields.
Broadly, we find two classes of models: scenarios in which all soft-terms are of order $m_{3/2}/{V}$
and scenarios where gaugino masses and A-terms are of this order but scalar masses are of order $m_{3/2}/{V}^{1/2}$.
In both cases the numerical coefficients of the soft-terms are determined by background fluxes and therefore can be tuned by scanning through the landscape.
This provides an explicit mechanism for the (small) tuning that might be necessary to confront LHC data.
In the first class of models the spectrum is similar to standard MSSM spectra with soft-terms of the same order but with the potential of extra non-universal flux dependent contribution.
The second one gives a universal mini split scenario with negligible non-universalities. We leave a detailed study of the LHC phenomenology of these models to a companion article \cite{us}.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sec.~\ref{slvs} contains the detailed setup that leads to sequestered LVS models and a presentation of two mechanisms to obtain dS vacua. We then compute the leading order expressions of the associated F-terms and soft-masses for these scenarios in Sec.~\ref{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses} before concluding in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}. Finally in Appendix~\ref{App} we present subleading corrections to F-terms while in Appendix~\ref{sec:deseq} we comment on possible sources of desequestering.


\section{Sequestered LVS scenarios}
\label{slvs}

\subsection{General setup}
\label{generalsetup}

Let us outline a setup in type IIB CY flux compactifications with O3/O7-planes that leads to moduli stabilisation
\`a la LVS and a visible sector sequestered from SUSY breaking:

\begin{itemize}
\item The simplest LVS vacua can be obtained for a CY with negative Euler number and at least one blow-up
of a point-like singularity \cite{Cicoli:2008va}. For these manifolds the volume~${V}$ is of Swiss-cheese type
\begin{equation}
{V} = \alpha_b \tau_b^{3/2} - \sum_i \alpha_i \tau_i^{3/2}\,,
\label{eq:vol}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_b$ denotes the overall big four-cycle volume and the $\tau_i$ denote blow-up moduli. The numerical coefficients $\alpha_{b,i}$ are determined by the CY triple intersection numbers and in what follows.\footnote{It is possible to implement LVS in CYs which have a more general volume form~\cite{Cicoli:2008va} but this does not alter the structure of soft-masses and so we do not consider these cases.}

\item The visible sector can be realised with appropriate D-brane configurations on blow-up moduli. Concrete D-brane realisations with D3/D7 branes at del Pezzo singularities can lead to interesting gauge/matter extensions of the MSSM. As we will discuss in Sec.~\ref{shrink}, the size of the associated four-cycle can shrink to zero value due to D-term stabilisation. Because of this shrinking, the F-term of the corresponding blow-up K\"ahler modulus is vanishing at leading order giving rise to a sequestered scenario.

\item In order to realise a dS vacuum one introduces further ingredients in the compactification. Here we concentrate on two options:
(i) Hidden sector matter fields on the large cycle which acquire non-zero F-terms because of D-term fixing~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}; (ii) E(-1) instantons at a second singularity whose blow-up mode develops non-vanishing F-terms due to new dilaton-dependent non-perturbative effects \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. These mechanisms will be discussed later in this section.
\end{itemize}
This setup has been realised in concrete CY orientifold compactifications with D3(/D7) branes at singularities~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw,Cicoli:2013mpa,Cicoli:2013cha} that satisfy all global consistency conditions (e.g.~tadpole cancellation).
The minimal setup that allows this realisation includes at least four K\"ahler moduli:
a `big' four-cycle $T_b$ controlling the size of the CY volume, a `small' blow up mode $T_s$
supporting non-perturbative effects, the visible sector cycle $T_\SM$ and its orientifold image $G$.
These last two moduli are associated to two del Pezzo divisors which collapse to zero size due to D-term fixing\footnote{The positivity of soft scalar masses for visible sector fields fixes all remaining flat-directions after D-term stabilisation \cite{Cicoli:2012vw}.}
and are exchanged by the orientifold involution.
This setup leads to $h^{1,1}_+ = 3$ and $h^{1,1}_- = 1$ with the following K\"ahler moduli:
\begin{equation}
T_b = \tau_b + i \psi_b\,, \quad T_s = \tau_s + i \psi_s\,, \quad T_\SM = \tau_\SM + i \psi_\SM\,, \quad G = b + i c\,,
\label{eq:cycles}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_b$, $\tau_s$ and $\tau_\SM\to 0$ are divisor volumes, the $\psi$'s are axions given by the reduction of $C_4$ on each of the relevant four-cycles,
whereas $b$ and $c$ are respectively the reduction of $B_2$ and $C_2$ on the two-cycle dual to the shrinking one.
The CY volume ${V}$ is a function of the K\"ahler moduli which takes the same form as in (\ref{eq:vol}).


\subsubsection{${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity effective field theory}

In this section we review the low energy effective action relevant for our construction
in the language of 4D ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity.
We take the superpotential of the following form
\begin{equation}
W= W_{\rm flux}(U,S) + A_s(U, S)\, e^{- a_s T_s} +  W_\dS+W_{\rm matter}\,.
\label{W}
\end{equation}
$W_{\rm flux}$ is the standard flux-generated superpotential~\cite{Gukov:1999ya}.
The second term incorporates non-perturbative effects on the `small' blow-up cycle which can arise from gaugino condensation or ED3-instantons.
The type of D-brane configuration determines the coefficient $a_s$ and the prefactor $A_s(U,S)$ depends on both complex structure moduli $U$ and the dilaton $S$ whose real part $s$ sets the string coupling: $\langle s\rangle =g_s^{-1}$.\footnote{The dependence on $S$ and $U$-moduli is structurally different, i.e.~the dependence on the dilaton is generated when including the backreaction of sources and warping on the geometry \cite{Baumann:2006th}.}
The term $W_\dS$ involves the contribution from the mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum (see Sec.~\ref{dsv})
while $W_{\rm matter}$ is the visible sector superpotential
\begin{equation}
W_{\rm matter} = \mu(M) H_u H_d + \frac 16 Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(M) C^\alpha C^\beta C^\gamma + \cdots\,,
\label{Wmatter}
\end{equation}
where we denoted the moduli as $M$ and the MSSM superfields as $C^\alpha$. Moreover, the dots refer to higher dimensional operators.
We also separated the two Higgs doublets $H_u$ and $H_d$ from the rest of matter fields in the moduli-dependent $\mu$-term.
Because of the holomorphicity of $W$ and the perturbative shift symmetry of the axionic components of the K\"ahler moduli,
the Yukawa couplings and the $\mu$-term can depend only on $S$ and $U$ at the perturbative level with the $T$-moduli appearing only non-perturbatively. We discuss this dependence in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses} and Appendix~\ref{sec:deseq}.

As motivated in~\cite{0810.5660,Blumenhagen:2009gk}, we assume the following form of the K\"ahler potential which describes the regime for the visible sector near the singularity
\begin{equation}
\label{generalk}
K = - 2 \ln\left({V} + \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\right) - \ln(2s) + \lambda_\SM \frac{\tau_\SM^2}{{V}} + \lambda_b \frac{b^2}{{V}}
+ K_\dS + K_{\rm cs}(U) + K_{\rm matter}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat\xi\equiv \xi s^{3/2}$, the $\lambda$'s are ${O}(1)$ coefficients, $K_{\rm cs}(U)$ is the tree-level K\"ahler potential for complex structure moduli and $K_\dS$ encodes the dependence on the sector responsible
for obtaining a dS vacuum (see Sec.~\ref{dsv}).
The matter K\"ahler potential $K_{\rm matter}$ is taken to be
\begin{equation}
K_{\rm matter} = \tilde{K}_{\alpha}(M, \overline{M}) \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} C^{\alpha} + [Z(M, \overline{M}) H_u H_d + \text{h.c.}]\,.
\label{mm}
\end{equation}
We assume at this stage that the matter metric is flavour diagonal beyond the leading order structure which was highlighted in~\cite{Conlon:2007dw}.\footnote{Subleading flavour off-diagonal entries which can in principle appear~\cite{Camara:2013fta} are taken to be absent. This is motivated by the appearance of additional anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries in D-brane models, in particular also in the context of del Pezzo singularities~\cite{1106.6039}.} The only exception is that we allow for the Higgs bilinear to appear in $K_{\rm matter}$
which we parameterise with the function $Z$.
Note that $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ is the matter metric for the visible sector which we will parameterise as~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K}_{\alpha} = \frac{f_\alpha(U,S)}{\cv^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat\xi}{\cv}
+ \tilde{K}_\dS + c_\SM \tau_\SM^p + c_b b^p\right), \qquad p > 0\,,
\label{mattermetric}
\end{equation}
where we have used $\tilde{K}_\dS$ to parameterise the dependence on the
dS mechanism (details will be given in Sec.~\ref{soft}). The $c$'s are taken as constants for simplicity while $p$ is taken to be positive
in order to have a well-behaved metric in the singular limit $b,\tau_\SM \to 0$.
As they can in principle depend on $U$ and $S$, we comment in due course on the influence on the soft-terms of such a dependence.
The appearance of the Higgs bilinear and its potential parametrisation are discussed in Sec.~\ref{bmusection} when we analyse the $\mu$-term in this scenario. In general the functions $f_\alpha(U,S)$ could be non-universal. Such non-universality can have interesting phenomenological implications (e.g.~mass hierarchies among families of sfermion masses needed for a realisation of natural SUSY).
As we are interested in soft-terms arising for D-branes at singularities, we take the gauge kinetic function to be
\begin{equation}
f_a=\delta_a S+ \kappa_a \,T_\SM\, ,
\label{eq:gaugekineticf}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_a$ are universal constants for $\mathbb{Z}_n$ singularities but can be non-universal for more general singularities.


\subsection{Moduli stabilisation}

As outlined earlier in this section, we stabilise the moduli following the LVS procedure.
The complex structure moduli and the dilaton are fixed at tree-level by background fluxes while the K\"ahler moduli are fixed using higher order corrections to the effective action \cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.


\subsubsection{D-term stabilisation}
\label{shrink}

The K\"ahler moduli where the visible sector D-brane configuration is located are stabilised using D-terms which are the leading order contribution to the potential. Remaining flat directions are stabilised using subleading F-term contributions. To set the notation, let us review D-term stabilisation \cite{Cicoli:2012vw}. The moduli $T_\SM$ and $G$ are charged under two anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$. The corresponding D-term potential reads
\begin{equation}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_1)} \left(\sum_\alpha q_{1 \alpha} \frac{\partial K}{\partial C^\alpha} C^\alpha - \xi_1\right)^2
+ \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_2)} \left(\sum_\alpha q_{2 \alpha} \frac{\partial K}{\partial C^\alpha} C^\alpha - \xi_2\right)^2\,,
\label{dtermpot}
\end{equation}
where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the gauge kinetic functions of the two $U(1)$s.
The Fayet-Iliopoulos~(FI) terms are given by (see appendix of \cite{Cicoli:2011yh} for the exact numerical factors)
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \xi_1 = - \frac{q_1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_\SM} = - \frac{q_1  \lambda_\SM}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\SM}{{V}}\,, \label{xiSM} \\
&& \xi_2 = - \frac{q_2}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial G} = - \frac{q_2 \lambda_b}{4\pi} \frac{b}{{V}}\, .
\end{eqnarray}
The vanishing D-term condition fixes therefore $\tau_\SM$ and $b$ in terms of visible sector matter fields.
The remaining flat directions are fixed by subleading F-term contributions which give vanishing VEVs to the $C^\alpha$ if they develop non-tachyonic soft masses from SUSY breaking \cite{Cicoli:2012vw}.\footnote{If the soft scalar masses of some $C^\alpha$ are tachyonic,
they develop non-zero VEVs (which could be phenomenologically allowed for some SM singlets) that, in turn, induce non-zero FI-terms \cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.
However $\tau_\SM$ and $b$ would still be fixed in the singular regime since their VEVs would be volume-suppressed \cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.}
Hence the D-term potential (\ref{dtermpot}) vanishes in the vacuum since it is fixed to a supersymmetric minimum at $\xi_1 = \xi_2 = 0$. This corresponds to the singular limit $\tau_\SM = b = 0$. In turn, the axions $\psi_\SM$ and $c$ are eaten up by the two $U(1)$ gauge bosons in the process of anomaly cancellation.

\subsubsection{F-term stabilisation}

Analysing the F-term scalar potential in an inverse volume expansion, one finds that the leading contribution scales as ${V}^{-2}$.
This is generated by the flux superpotential $W_{\rm flux}$ and is positive semi-definite
\begin{equation}
\label{vddilaton}
V_{{O}({{V}}^{-2})} = \frac{1}{2 s{V}^2} \left.\left[4 s^2 |D_S W_{\rm flux}|^2
+ K^{U \overline{U}} D_U W_{\rm flux} D_{\overline{U}} \overline{W}_{\rm flux}\right]\right|_{\xi=0},
\end{equation}
where the subscript $\xi = 0$ denotes that $\alpha'$ corrections can be neglected at this level of approximation.
This potential fixes the dilaton and the complex structure moduli at a supersymmetric minimum located at
\begin{equation}
\label{susyminim}
\left.D_S W_{\rm flux}\right|_{\xi  = 0} = 0\ , \qquad D_U W_{\rm flux} \big{|}_{\xi = 0} = 0\ , \qquad \langle W_{\rm flux}\rangle\equiv W_0\ .
\end{equation}
The K\"ahler moduli are stabilised using $\alpha'$ corrections to $K$ (\ref{generalk})
and non-perturbative corrections to $W$ (\ref{W}) which give rise to ${O}({V}^{-3})$ contributions
to the scalar potential\footnote{We have already fixed the axion $\psi_s$ at $a_s\langle\psi_s\rangle=\pi$.
The axion $\psi_b$ associated to the large cycle can develop a potential only via $T_b$-dependent non-perturbative effects.}
\begin{equation}
\label{v0}
V_{{O}({{V}}^{-3})} = \frac{1}{2 s} \left[\frac{8}{3}(a_s A_s)^2 \sqrt{\tau_s} \frac{e^{- 2 a_s \tau_s}}{{V}}
- 4 a_s A_s W_0 \tau_s \frac{e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{{V}^2 } + \frac{3\hat\xi W_0^2}{4{V}^3}\right]\, .
\end{equation}
This potential admits an AdS global minimum which breaks SUSY. Minimisation with respect to $\tau_s$ yields
\begin{equation}
e^{- a_s \tau_s} = \frac{3 \sqrt{\tau_s} W_0}{4 a_s A_s {V}} \frac{\left(1-4\epsilon_s\right)}{\left(1-\epsilon_s\right)}\qquad\text{with}\qquad \epsilon_s \equiv\frac{1}{4 a_s \tau_s}\sim{O}\left(\frac{1}{\ln{V}}\right)\ll 1\,.
\label{eataus}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, minimisation with respect to $\tau_b$ gives
\begin{equation}
\tau_s^{3/2} = \frac{\hat\xi}{2} \left[1 + f_\dS(\epsilon_s) \right]\,,
\label{tausms}
\end{equation}
where $f_\dS$ is a subdominant function of $\epsilon_s$ which depends on the particular mechanism used to obtain a dS vacuum (see Appendix~\ref{App}).
The relation (\ref{tausms}) implies that at the minimum (neglecting $f_\dS$)
\begin{equation}
\hat\xi\simeq \frac{1}{4\left(a_s \epsilon_s\right)^{3/2}}\sim{O}\left[\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}\right] \gg 1\,.
\label{tausms2}
\end{equation}
Given that the potential (\ref{v0}) depends on $S$ and $U$ (via $A_s(U,S)$ and $s$-dependent $\alpha'$ effects),
the minimum (\ref{susyminim}) is slightly shifted from its supersymmetric locus. This shift is fundamental for the soft-term computation
in sequestered scenarios since non-vanishing F-terms of $U$ and $S$ at subleading order
can actually provide the main contribution to soft-terms~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}.

\subsubsection{Shift in the dilaton and complex structure minimum}
\label{shiftsection}

Let us try to estimate the shift of $S$ and $U$ from their supersymmetric minimum (\ref{susyminim}) because of $\alpha'$
and non-perturbative effects. The K\"ahler covariant derivative of the total superpotential evaluated at the minimum (\ref{eataus}) and (\ref{tausms})
reads (we neglect ${O}(\epsilon_s)$ effects)
\begin{equation}
D_S W \simeq \left.D_S W_{\rm flux}\right|_{\xi = 0} - \frac{3\hat\xi W_0}{4s{V}}
\left[1 + \epsilon_s s\partial_s \ln A_s(U,S)\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Since we do not know the functional dependence of $A_s(U,S)$ and since the $W_\dS$ term in (\ref{W})
can also potentially shift the dilaton minimum, it is not
possible for us to compute this shift explicitly. We will parameterise it by using the parameter $\omega_S(U,S)$ defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{dilmin}
D_S W = - \frac{3 \omega_S(U,S)}{4} \frac{\hat\xi W_0}{s{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
The dependence of $A_s(U, S)$ on the complex structure moduli is also responsible for shifting the $U$-moduli
from their supersymmetric minimum. After imposing the minimisation conditions, the total $D_U W$ looks like (denoting $u\equiv {\rm Re}(U)$)
\begin{equation}
D_U W \simeq \left.D_U W_{\rm flux}\right|_{\xi = 0} - \frac{3\hat\xi W_0}{4{V}}
\epsilon_s \partial_u\left[K_{\rm cs}(U)+  \ln A_s(U,S)\right]\,,
\end{equation}
and so we can parameterise this shift by $\omega_{U_i}(U,S)$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{csmin}
D_{U_i} W = - \frac{3 \omega_{U_i} (U,S)}{4} \frac{\hat\xi W_0}{s{V}}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad D_{U_i} W =\frac{\omega_{U_i} (U,S)}{\omega_S(U,S)} D_S W\sim {O}({V}^{-1})\,,
\end{equation}
where both $\omega_S$ and $\omega_{U_i}$ are expected to be ${O}(1)$ functions of $S$ and $U$. Note that both functions $\omega_{S,U_i}$ depend also on the dS mechanism.

\subsection{Scenarios for de Sitter vacua}
\label{dsv}

In this section we review two mechanisms which can lead to dS vacua in LVS.

\subsubsection{Case 1: dS vacua from hidden matter fields}
\label{matteruplift}

In the LVS setting, dS vacua can arise if some hidden matter fields
acquire non-vanishing F-terms which provide a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential \cite{Cicoli:2012vw}.
The models constructed in \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} provide globally consistent explicit examples
of string models with a semi-realistic visible sector, moduli stabilisation and a positive cosmological constant
(see Fig.~\ref{Fig1} for a pictorial sketch of this setup).

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{hiddenmatterink.eps}
\caption{Pictorial sketch of our CY setup for dS vacua from hidden matter fields.} \label{Fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Generically, the choice of $B_2$ which cancels the Freed-Witten anomaly on the small cycle $T_s$,
leads to non-vanishing gauge fluxes on the big cycle $T_b$. As a consequence, $T_b$ acquires a non-zero $U(1)$-charge $q_b$
generating a moduli-dependent FI-term. The D-term potential becomes
(focusing for simplicity on a single matter field $\phi_\dS$ with K\"ahler metric $K_\dS= s^{-1}|\phi_\dS|^2$ \cite{Conlon:2006tj, Aparicio:2008wh} and $U(1)$-charge $q_\phi$)
\begin{equation}
\label{dmatter}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_b)} \left(\frac{q_\phi}{s} |\phi_\dS|^2 - \xi_b\right)^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $f_b = T_b$ (neglecting $S$-dependent flux corrections) and the FI-term is given by
\begin{equation}
\xi_b = - \frac{q_b}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_b} = \frac{3 q_b}{8\pi}\frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}}\,,
\end{equation}
Therefore the total scalar potential takes the form
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_D + V_F =  \frac{1}{2{V}^{2/3}} \left(\frac{q_\phi}{s}  |\phi_\dS|^2 - \frac{3 q_b}{8\pi{V}^{2/3}}\right)^2
+ \frac{1}{s} m_{3/2}^2 |\phi_\dS|^2 + V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{Vtot}
\end{equation}
where $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass as in eq.~(\ref{m32}) and $V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}$ is given in (\ref{v0}).
If the two $U(1)$-charges $q_\phi$ and $q_b$ have the same sign,
$\phi_\dS$ develops a non-vanishing VEV
\begin{equation}
\label{minphi}
\frac{q_\phi}{s} |\phi_\dS|^2 = \xi_b - \frac{m_{3/2}^2 {V}^{2/3}}{q_\phi}\,.
\end{equation}
Substituting this VEV in (\ref{Vtot}) we obtain
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{D,0}+\frac{3 q_b}{16\pi q_\phi} \frac{W_0^2}{s  {V}^{8/3}}+V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{VTOT}
\end{equation}
where the new positive contribution can lead to an LVS dS vacuum
while the D-term potential gives rise only to a subleading effect of order
\begin{equation}
V_{D,0} = \frac{m_{3/2}^4 {V}^{2/3}}{2 q_\phi^2}\sim {O}\left({V}^{-10/3}\right)\,.
\label{VD0ds1}
\end{equation}
Following \cite{Cicoli:2012vw}, we can minimise the total scalar potential (\ref{VTOT}) with respect to $\tau_s$ and ${V}$,
finding the following value of the vacuum energy (neglecting the subleading effect of $V_{D,0}$)
\begin{equation}
\langle V_{\rm tot} \rangle \simeq \frac{3 W_0^2}{8s a_s^{3/2}\langle{V}\rangle^3}\left[\delta\, {V}^{1/3}
-\sqrt{\ln\left(\frac{\langle{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)}\right]\,,
\label{VTOTfin}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\delta = \frac{1}{18\pi}\frac{q_b\,a_s^{3/2}}{q_\phi} \simeq 0.02 \left(\frac{q_b\,a_s^{3/2}}{q_\phi}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
A cancellation of the vacuum energy at ${O}({V}^{-3})$ requires therefore to tune $W_0$ so that
(a subleading tuning is needed to cancel also $V_{D,0}$)
\begin{equation}
\left[\ln\left(\frac{\langle{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)\right]^{3/2}= \delta^3\, \langle{V}\rangle \sim 5\cdot 10^{-6}\, \langle{V}\rangle\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad
|\phi_\dS|^2 = \frac{27 s}{4 a_s^{3/2}{V}}\sqrt{\ln\left(\frac{\langle{V}\rangle}{W_0}\right)}\sim \frac{1}{{V}\sqrt{\epsilon_s}}\,.
\label{CCconddS1}
\end{equation}
For natural ${O}(1)$ values of all underlying parameters, this relation gives a minimum for ${V}$ at order $10^6 - 10^7$ (see~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}).

\subsubsection{Case 2: dS vacua from non-perturbative effects at singularities}
\label{dilatonuplift}

Reference \cite{Cicoli:2012fh} provided a novel method for obtaining LVS dS vacua
(see Fig.~\ref{Fig2} for a pictorial sketch of this setup).
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{dilatonink.eps}
\caption{Pictorial view of our CY setup for dS vacua from non-perturbative effects at singularities.} \label{Fig2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The additional contribution to the scalar potential needed to achieve a positive cosmological constant arises
from non-perturbative effects at singularities (like gaugino condensation on spacetime filling D3-branes or E(-1) instantons).
These effects generate a new contribution to the superpotential (\ref{W}) of the form
\begin{equation}
W_\dS = A_\dS(U, S) \,e^{-a_\dS (S + \kappa_\dS T_\dS)}\,.
\label{Wds2}
\end{equation}
Because of the presence of an additional K\"ahler modulus, the K\"ahler potential (\ref{generalk}) has to be supplemented with
\begin{equation}
\label{dk2}
K_\dS =  \lambda_\dS\frac{\tau_\dS^2}{{V}}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\tau_\dS={\rm Re}(T_\dS)$. This blow-up mode can be fixed in the singular regime by minimising the hidden sector D-term potential
(focusing for simplicity on canonically normalised hidden fields $\phi_{{\rm h},i}$ with charges $q_{{\rm h},i}$ under an anomalous $U(1)$)
\begin{equation}
\label{DtermPot1}
V_D = \frac{1}{2{\rm Re}(f_{\rm h})} \left(\sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2 - \xi_{\rm h}\right)^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $f_{\rm h} = S$ (neglecting $T_\dS$-dependent corrections) and the FI-term is given by
($q_\dS$ is the $U(1)$-charge of $T_\dS$ and from now on we set $\lambda_\dS=1$ for simplicity)
\begin{equation}
\xi_{\rm h} = - \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\partial K}{\partial T_\dS} = - \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
In fact, the total scalar potential takes the leading order form (after fixing the axionic phase of $T_\dS$) \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = \frac{1}{2s} \left(\sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2 + \frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{{V}}\right)^2
+ \frac{\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^2}{s}\frac{e^{-2 a_\dS \left(s+\kappa_\dS\tau_\dS\right)}}{{V}} + V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}\,,
\label{Vtot1}
\end{equation}
where the second term comes from the new superpotential (\ref{Wds2}) and $V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}$ is given in~(\ref{v0}).
Minimisation with respect to $\tau_\dS$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{q_\dS}{4\pi} \frac{\tau_\dS}{{V}}=- \sum_i q_{{\rm h},i} |\phi_{{\rm h},i}|^2
+ \frac{a_\dS \kappa_\dS}{q_\dS}\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^2 e^{-2 a_\dS s}\,.
\label{tdsVEV}
\end{equation}
Assuming that model-dependent contributions from F-terms of hidden matter fields fix some $\phi_{{\rm h}, i}$ at non-zero VEVs
such that $\langle\sum_i q_{{\rm hid},i} |\phi_{{\rm hid},i}|^2\rangle = 0$ but $A_\dS\neq 0$,\footnote{In order to make $W_\dS$ gauge invariant,
$A_\dS$ has to depend on the $\phi_{{\rm h},i}$ which can develop non-zero VEVs for appropriate hidden field F-term contributions, giving $A_\dS\neq 0$ with $\tau_\dS$ in the singular regime \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}.} and substituting the VEV (\ref{tdsVEV}) in (\ref{Vtot1}) we obtain at leading order
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm tot} = V_{D,0}+ \frac{(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS)^2}{s} \frac{e^{-2 a_\dS s}}{{V}} + V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}\,.
\end{equation}
Given that the dilaton is fixed by a ratio of flux quanta,
the extra positive-definite contribution can easily be tuned to obtain a dS minimum. Following \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}, a cancellation of the vacuum energy
at ${O}({V}^{-3})$ requires to tune 3-form fluxes such that
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS}{W_0}\right)^2 \,e^{-2 a_\dS s}
= \frac{9}{32} \frac{\epsilon_s \hat\xi}{{V}^2}\,.
\label{CCconddS2}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the D-term potential gives rise only to a subleading effect of order
\begin{equation}
V_{D,0} =\frac{1}{2s} \left(\frac{a_\dS \kappa_\dS}{q_\dS}\right)^2\left(\kappa_\dS a_\dS A_\dS\right)^4 e^{-4 a_\dS s}\sim {O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)\,.
\label{VD0ds2}
\end{equation}

\section{F-terms and soft-terms}
\label{sec:ftermsandsoftmasses}

In this section we list the leading order contributions to the F-terms relevant for the computation of all soft-terms (see Appendix~\ref{App} for the structure of subleading corrections to the F-terms). After defining our parametrisation for the K\"ahler matter metric in local and ultra-local scenarios, we then calculate the soft-terms.

\subsection{Summary of F-terms}
\label{fterms}

The general supergravity expression for an F-term is \cite{Kaplunovsky:1993rd, Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{equation}
F^I = e^{K/2} K^{I \overline{J}} D_{\overline{J}} W\,.
\end{equation}
The exact expressions for the F-terms are rather complicated. Considerable simplifications occur
if we perform an expansion in ${V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$. We also factor out the gravitino mass which is given by the following expression
\begin{equation}
m_{3/2}=e^{K/2} |W|= \left(\frac{g_s^2 M_P}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)\frac{W_0}{{V}} \left[ 1-\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2{V}}
\left(1+3 y_\dS \epsilon_s+{O}(\epsilon_s^2)\right)+{O}\left(\frac{1}{{V}^2}\right)\right]\,,
\label{expandm32}
\end{equation}
where $y_\dS =1$ for the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift} while $y_\dS = 1+\frac{\sqrt{2} a_s^{3/4}}{\kappa_\dS a_\dS}$ for the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift}. The leading order F-terms for $T_b$ and $T_s$ turn out to be
(we show the first subleading correction only for $F^{T_b}$ since its dominant term
does not contribute to the soft-term because of the no-scale structure)
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^{T_b}}{\tau_b} \simeq - 2 m_{3/2} \left(1+\frac{x_\dS}{a_s^{3/2} {V}\sqrt{\epsilon_s}}\right)\,,
\qquad
\frac{F^{T_s}}{\tau_s} \simeq - 6   m_{3/2} \epsilon_s\,,
\label{FTb}
\end{equation}
where $x_\dS = - 45/16$ for the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift} while $x_\dS \sim {O}(1/{V})$ for the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift}
(see Appendix \ref{App}).
Because of the shift from their supersymmetric minimum, also $S$ and $U$ develop non-vanishing F-terms whose leading order
expressions are
\begin{equation}
\label{ds}
\frac{F^S}{s} \simeq \frac{3 \omega'_S(U,S) }{8 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}\,, \qquad
F^{U_i} \simeq - \frac{K^{U_i \overline{U}_{\overline{j}}}}{2 s^2}\frac{\omega_{\overline{U}_{\overline{j}}}(U,S)}{\omega'_S(U,S)}F^S\equiv \beta^{U_i}(U,S)F^S\,,
\end{equation}
where $\omega'_S(U,S) \equiv 3 - 2 \omega_S(U,S)$ with $\omega_S$ as defined in (\ref{dilmin}) and $\beta^{U_i}$
are unknown ${O}(1)$ functions of $U$ and $S$.
Additional non-zero F-terms are associated to fields responsible to achieve a dS solution.
For the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift} there is an F-term associated to $\phi_\dS$
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^{\phi_\dS}}{\phi_\dS} \simeq m_{3/2}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\phi_\dS$ given in (\ref{CCconddS1}) (up to an irrelevant phase). On the other hand,
in the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift} the blow-up mode $T_\dS$ has a non-vanishing F-term
(using the condition (\ref{CCconddS2}))
\begin{equation}
F^{T_\dS} \simeq \frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}a_s^{3/4}}\frac{m_{3/2}}{\epsilon_s^{1/4}} \,.
\end{equation}
Finally, the F-terms associated to the MSSM cycles $T_\SM$ and $G$ vanish:
\begin{equation}
F^G = F^{T_\SM} = 0\, .
\end{equation}
This result is crucial for sequestering since the dominant F-terms are then associated with moduli which couple weakly to the visible sector via Planck-suppressed interactions.\footnote{$T_\SM$ and $G$ can develop non-zero F-terms only in the presence of tachyonic scalar masses \cite{Cicoli:2013cha}. However, also in this case, their contribution to soft-terms turns out to be negligible.}


\subsection{Local and ultra-local scenarios}
\label{soft}

Our analysis of soft-terms will distinguish between two classes of models: local and ultra-local.
To motivate this classification we discuss the constraints (along the lines of~\cite{Conlon:2006tj}) that locality imposes on the moduli dependence
of the physical Yukawa couplings $\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$
\begin{equation}
\label{yuk}
\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} =e^{K/2}\,\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\sqrt {\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma} }\, ,
\end{equation}
where $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$ are the holomorphic Yukawas which do not depend on the K\"ahler moduli
due to the holomorphicity of $W$ and the perturbative shift symmetry of the $T$-axions. The K\"ahler potential $K$ is given in (\ref{generalk})
whereas the matter metrics $\tilde{K}_\alpha$, $\tilde{K}_\beta$ and $\tilde{K}_\gamma$ are given in (\ref{mattermetric}).
Since the physical Yukawas are determined by local interactions of open string
degrees of freedom, one expects at leading order that their strength is insensitive
to the overall volume of the compactification. Thus for (\ref{yuk}) to yield a result independent of ${V}$
one needs at leading order in an inverse volume expansion (for $\tau_\SM = b= C^\alpha= 0$)
\begin{equation}
\label{ul}
\tilde{K}_\alpha = h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K/3} \simeq  \frac{h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}{V}^{2/3}}
\left(1- \frac{\hat\xi}{3{V}}  + \frac 13 K_\dS\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $h_\alpha(U,S)$ is an unknown function of $U$ and $S$ and in the approximation we focus on the first subleading order corrections, e.g.~neglecting higher order corrections of ${O}\left(1/{V}^{8/3}\right)$. Note
that this result has the same volume scaling of our formula for the matter metric (\ref{mattermetric}) which for $\tau_\SM = b= 0$ reduces to
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K}_{\alpha} = \frac{f_\alpha(U,S)}{{V}^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat\xi}{{V}}
+ \tilde{K}_\dS\right)\equiv f_\alpha(U,S)\tilde{K}\,.
\label{newKtilde}
\end{equation}
As found in \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}, our soft-term computation is sensitive to the form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha-$
beyond leading order in a ${V}^{-1}$ expansion. There is no reason
to expect that (\ref{ul}) still holds beyond leading order
since we cannot use locality to fix the form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$
(although there is some evidence from perturbative string computations \cite{Conlon:2011jq}).
It was noted in~\cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} that the relation (\ref{ul}) has
interesting implications for the soft-terms. Guided by this, we organise our analysis of models into two classes of phenomenological models:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Local}: We call a scenario `local' if (\ref{ul}) holds only to leading order in ${V}^{-1}$;
\item {\it Ultra-local}: We call a scenario `ultra-local' if (\ref{ul}) holds exactly.
\end{itemize}
If we parameterise $\tilde{K}_\dS$ as $\tilde{K}_\dS  =  c_\dS K_\dS$,
comparing (\ref{ul}) with (\ref{newKtilde}), we find that in the ultra-local case
\begin{equation}
f_{\alpha}(U,S) = \frac{h_\alpha(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}}\qquad \text{and}\qquad c_s=c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\label{fdef}
\end{equation}
Subleading deviations from the approximation in~(\ref{ul}) can be accounted for by small changes in $c_s$ and $c_\dS$ at the appropriate subleading order.

\subsection{Soft-terms}

We now proceed to compute all soft-terms distinguishing between
ultra-local and local scenarios. Throughout this section we work to
leading order in ${V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$.

\subsubsection{Gaugino masses}

The general expression for gaugino masses in gravity mediation is
\begin{equation}
\label{gauginomass}
M_a = \frac{1}{2 {\rm Re}\left(f_a\right)} F^I \partial_I f_a\, ,
\end{equation}
where $f_a=\delta_a S+ \kappa_a \,T_\SM$ is the gauge kinetic function as in~\eqref{eq:gaugekineticf}. As $F^{T_\SM}=0$, we obtain universal gaugino masses,
$M_1=M_2=M_3=M_{1/2}$, which are generated by the dilaton F-term. Potential non-universalities can arise through anomaly mediated contributions which turn out to be subleading (see Appendix~\ref{anosec} for more details).
The leading order expression for the gaugino masses is
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2} = \frac{F^S}{2 s} \simeq \frac{3 \omega'_S(U,S)}{16 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}
\sim {O}\left(m_{3/2}\frac{\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)\ll m_{3/2}\,.
\label{ggmm}
\end{equation}
Note that this leading order result depends on the shift of the dilaton minimum
induced by $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects (see Sec.~\ref{shiftsection}).
In this paper we neglect possible phases of gaugino masses. We will return to this question in the context of the low-energy analysis of soft-terms~\cite{us}.


\subsubsection{Scalar masses}
\label{scalarsection}

Scalar masses in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-term contributions. Let us study them separately, presenting their leading order expressions.\\

\noindent \textbf{F-term contributions}
\medskip\\
Assuming a diagonal K\"ahler matter metric as in~(\ref{mm}), the general expression for the F-term contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation is \cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{equation}
\label{genscalF}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F = m_{3/2}^2 - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln \tilde{K}_\alpha\,.
\end{equation}

\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we obtain universal scalar masses, $m_\alpha^2=m_0^2$ $\forall \alpha$, where
\begin{equation}
\left.m_0^2\right|_F \simeq m_{3/2}^2 - \left(\frac{F^{T_b}}{2}\right)^2 \partial^2_{\tau_b} \ln\tilde{K}
\simeq \frac{5\left(c_s-\frac 13\right)}{\omega'_S}\, m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)\,.
\label{localscalar}
\end{equation}
The dominant contribution to this expression comes from the F-term of $T_b$.
More precisely, the leading term of $F^{T_b}$ in (\ref{FTb}) together with the leading term of $\tilde{K}$ in (\ref{newKtilde})
give a contribution which cancels against $m_{3/2}^2$ in (\ref{localscalar}) because of the underlying no-scale structure.
The first non-vanishing term in (\ref{localscalar}) originates from the leading term of $F^{T_b}$
together with the first subleading correction to $\tilde{K}$. On the other hand, the subleading correction to $F^{T_b}$ in (\ref{FTb}) yields a contribution
suppressed by $\epsilon_s$, and so turns out to be negligible.

Scalar masses are universal since they get generated by the F-term of $T_b$. Non-universal effects
can arise from $F^S$ and $F^{U_i}$ but they are volume suppressed since they would give contributions of order $m_{3/2}^2/{V}^2$. If $c_s>1/3,$ the scalar masses are non-tachyonic.

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: An interesting feature of (\ref{localscalar}) is that it vanishes if one takes the ultra-local limit
$c_s= 1/3$.\footnote{We neglect potential higher order corrections at this stage.} In fact, there is a general argument \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} which guarantees the vanishing of $m_0^2$
at ${O}({V}^{-3})$. Using (\ref{ul}) (the defining property of ultra-local models)
in the general expression for the F-term contributions to scalar masses (\ref{genscalF}) we find
\begin{equation}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F = - \frac 13 V_{F,0} - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln h_\alpha(U,S)\,,
\label{ulsm2}
\end{equation}
where we used the fact that $V_F= K_{I\overline{J}}F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}}- 3 m_{3/2}^2$.
Recalling that $V_0 = V_{F,0} + V_{D,0}$ and setting the cosmological constant to zero (in the dS constructions of Sec.~\ref{dsv} we showed how to cancel $V_0$ at ${O}({V}^{-3})$ but this can in principle be done at any order in the ${V}^{-1}$ expansion), $V_{F,0}$ can be traded for $V_{D,0}$,
and we so shall include it in our analysis of D-term contributions to scalar masses.

On the other hand, if the functions $h_\alpha(S,U)$ are not constants, there is a non-vanishing contribution
from the F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli at ${O}({V}^{-2})$. Using (\ref{ds}),
the $S$ and $U$-dependent contribution to scalar masses turns out to be
\begin{equation}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_F =  - M_{1/2}^2 s^2 \left(\partial_s^2+\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i} \partial_s
+ \beta^{U_i}\beta^{\overline{U}_j}\partial_{u_i} \partial_{u_j}\right) \ln h_\alpha(U,S)\sim {O}\left(M_{1/2}^2\right)\,,
\label{ulsm3}
\end{equation}
where $M_{1/2}$ is the gaugino mass in (\ref{ggmm}). Note that this contribution is generically non-universal
and might also give rise to tachyonic scalars depending on the explicit functional dependence of the functions $h_\alpha(U,S)$.\\

\noindent \textbf{D-term contributions}
\medskip\\
Assuming a diagonal K\"ahler matter metric as in~\eqref{mm}, the general expression for the D-term contributions to scalar masses in gravity mediation is \cite{Dudas:2005vv}
\begin{equation}
\left.m_\alpha^2\right|_D = \tilde{K}_\alpha^{-1} \sum_i g_i^2 D_i \partial^2_{\alpha \overline{\alpha}} D_i- V_{D,0}\,.
\label{genscalD}
\end{equation}
Given that this result depends on the value of the D-term potential at the minimum, this contribution depends on the way to achieve a dS vacuum.
As explained in Sec.~\ref{shrink}, the VEV of the D-term potential associated to visible sector $U(1)$s is vanishing in the absence of tachyonic scalars.\footnote{Even in the presence of tachyonic scalars, the contribution to scalar masses from visible sector D-terms turns out to be a negligible effect since visible matter fields, $\tau_\SM$ and $b$ would still be stabilised at zero at leading order.}

\medskip
\emph{dS case 1}: In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift} the relevant D-term is the one associated with the anomalous $U(1)$ living on the big cycle.
As can be seen from (\ref{VD0ds1}), $V_{D,0}$ scales as ${V}^{-10/3}$ which is subdominant with respect to the first term in (\ref{genscalD}) that gives
\begin{equation}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D = \frac{q_b}{2 f_\alpha(U,S)} D_{\dS_1} \partial_{\tau_b} \tilde{K}_{\alpha}= \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{3s}|\phi_\dS|^2
= \frac{6\epsilon_s}{\omega'_S}m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim  {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\sqrt{\ln{V}}}{{V}}\right)\,,
\label{sc1}
\end{equation}
once we impose the condition (\ref{CCconddS1}) to have a vanishing cosmological constant at ${O}({V}^{-3})$.
In the local limit, this result is suppressed with respect to the F-term contribution (\ref{localscalar}) by a factor of $\epsilon_s$.
On the other hand, in the ultra-local limit, this D-term contribution dominates over the F-term one given in (\ref{ulsm3}) which scales as $m_{3/2}^2\epsilon^2$.
Hence it leads to universal and non-tachyonic scalar masses.

\medskip
\emph{dS case 2}: In the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift} the relevant D-term is the one associated with the anomalous $U(1)$ which belongs to the hidden sector responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. In this case both terms in (\ref{genscalD}) have the same scaling since
\begin{equation}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D = \frac{q_\dS {V}^{2/3}}{2 s f_\alpha(U,S)} D_{\dS_2} \partial_{\tau_\dS} \tilde{K}_{\alpha}-V_{D,0}
= \frac{c_\dS}{s} D_{\dS_2} q_\dS\frac{\tau_\dS}{{V}} -V_{D,0} = \left(2c_\dS-1\right)V_{D,0}\,.
\label{Vds22}
\end{equation}
As can be seen from (\ref{VD0ds2}), $V_{D,0}$ scales as ${V}^{-4}$. Hence in the local limit the D-term contribution
is subleading with respect to the F-term one given in (\ref{localscalar}) which scales as ${V}^{-3}$.
In the ultra-local limit the F-term contribution to scalar masses is given by (\ref{ulsm2}).
Adding $-V_{F,0}/3= V_{D,0}/3$ to (\ref{Vds22}) we find that the total D-term contribution to scalar masses vanishes in the ultra-local limit once we impose $c_\dS=1/3$ as in (\ref{fdef}) since
\begin{equation}
\left.m_0^2\right|_D =  2\left(c_\dS-\frac 13\right)V_{D,0}=0 \quad\text{for}\quad c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\label{Vds2}
\end{equation}
Hence scalar masses get generated by F-terms also in the ultra-local limit.
Their expression is given in (\ref{ulsm3}) and scales as ${V}^{-4}$.\\

\noindent \textbf{Summary}
\medskip\\
Let us summarise our results for soft scalar masses.
The expression for $m_0^2$ in the local limit does not depend on the way to obtain a dS vacuum since in each case
it is given by the F-term contribution (\ref{localscalar}) that scales as ${V}^{-3}$. Scalar masses are non-tachyonic if $c_s>1/3$ and universal.
On the other hand, the result for the ultra-local limit depends on the dS mechanism.
In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift}, scalar masses get generated by the D-term contribution (\ref{sc1}) which has again an overall ${V}^{-3}$ scaling but with an $\epsilon_s$ suppression with respect to the local case. Scalar masses turn out to be non-tachyonic and universal.
On the contrary, in the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift}, the main contribution to scalar masses comes from F-terms and it is given by (\ref{ulsm3}) which scales as ${V}^{-4}$. This result could potentially lead to tachyonic and non-universal scalar masses depending on the exact functional dependence of the functions $h_\alpha(U,S)$.

\subsubsection{A-terms}

For the current discussion, we assume that the Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ receive no non-perturbative contributions from the K\"ahler moduli and are hence only functions of the complex structure moduli and the dilaton $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}=Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$. The trilinear A-terms in gravity mediation receive both F- and D-term contributions. The D-term contributions turn out to be zero for vanishing VEVs of visible sector matter fields \cite{Dudas:2005vv}. On the other hand, the general formula for the F-term contribution is \cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{equation}
\label{tril}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = F^I \partial_I
\left[K + \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma}\right)\right]
= F^I \partial_I
\left[K -3\ln\tilde{K}+ \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where the holomorphic Yukawas $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$ do not depend on the K\"ahler moduli because of their axionic shift symmetry.
Let us present the expression for $A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ at leading order in ${V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we find
\begin{equation}
\label{tril1}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}= - \left[1 -s\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i} K_{\rm cs} - \frac{6}{\omega'_S}\left(c_s-\frac 13\right)
- s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma} \right) \right] M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
with $\partial_{s,u}\equiv \partial_s+\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i}$.
Note that there is a cancellation at ${O}({V}^{-1})$ between $K$ and $3\ln\tilde{K}$ in (\ref{tril}).
The dominant contributions to (\ref{tril1}) come from the F-terms of $T_b$, $S$ and $U$.

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: In the ultra-local limit defined by (\ref{ul}), the contribution to $A_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ from $F^{T_b}$ vanishes,
as can be seen at leading order in (\ref{tril1}) by setting $c_s=1/3$ and $f_{\alpha} = h_\alpha\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}(2s)^{-1/3}$.
In this limit, the general expression (\ref{tril}) simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\label{trilul}
A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = s \partial_{s,u}
\ln \left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{h_\alpha h_\beta h_\gamma}\right) M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{$\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$ terms}
\label{bmusection}

Let us discuss different effects that can contribute to the superpotential and K\"ahler potential Higgs bi-linear terms. Whether they are present or not is model dependent and a concrete realisation or combination of various mechanisms might not be possible. The following list should be understood as a list of possible effects that can lead to a non-vanishing $\mu$-term.
The canonically normalised $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms receive contributions from both K\"ahler potential and superpotential effects.
Let us discuss these two different effects separately.\\

\noindent \textbf{K\"ahler potential contributions}\medskip\\
Non-zero $\hat{\mu}$ and $B \hat{\mu}$ get generated from a non-vanishing prefactor $Z$ in the matter K\"ahler potential (\ref{mm})~\cite{Kim:1983dt,Giudice:1988yz}. Their general expression in gravity mediation is \cite{Brignole:1993dj,Dudas:2005vv}
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mu} = \left(m_{3/2} Z - \overline{F}^{\overline{I}} \partial_{\overline{I}} Z\right)
\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2}\quad\text{and}\quad B\hat{\mu} = \left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_F + \left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_D\,,
\label{muK}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_F &=& \left\{2 m_{3/2}^2 Z - m_{3/2} \overline{F}^{\overline{I}} \partial_{\overline{I}} Z + m_{3/2} F^I \left[\partial_I Z - Z \partial_I \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right]\right. \nonumber \\
&& \left. - F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} \left[\partial_I \partial_{\overline{J}} Z - \partial_I Z \partial_{\overline{J}} \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right] \right\}\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2} \,, \label{BmuKF} \\
\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_D &=& \left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2}\left(\sum_i g_i^2 D_i \partial_{H_u} \partial_{H_d} D_i - V_{D,0} Z\right)\,.
\label{BmuKD}
\end{eqnarray}
Motivated by the fact that we are at the singular regime, we take $Z$ of the same form as the matter metric (\ref{mattermetric})
with $f_\alpha(U,S)$ replaced by a different unknown function of $S$ and $U$ which we denote $\gamma(U,S)$.
We stress that $Z=\gamma(U,S)\tilde{K}$ is just the simplest ansatz for $Z$ given our present knowledge
but its form could in general be different from $\tilde{K}_\alpha$.\footnote{However in models with a shift-symmetric Higgs sector $f_{H_u}=f_{H_d}=\gamma$ \cite{LopesCardoso:1994is,Antoniadis:1994hg,Brignole:1995fb,Brignole:1996xb,Hebecker:2012qp}.}

Let us compute the leading expressions (in an expansion in ${V}^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_s$) for both $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$
in the local and ultra-local limit.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit we find
\begin{equation}
\hat\mu  =  \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u } f_{H_d}}} \left[\frac{6}{3 \omega'_S} \left(c_s-\frac 13\right)
- s \partial_{s,u} \ln\gamma \right] M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\,,
\label{mu11}
\end{equation}
where again there is a cancellation at ${O}({V}^{-1})$ between the term proportional to $m_{3/2}$ in (\ref{muK})
and the leading order contribution from $\overline{F}^{\overline{T}_b}\partial_{\overline{T}_b}Z$.
The dominant contributions to (\ref{mu11}) come from the F-terms of $T_b$, $S$ and $U$.
On the other hand, the $B\hat\mu$-term behaves as the soft scalar masses since both F- and D-term contributions can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\left.B\hat{\mu}\right|_{F,D} = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u} f_{H_d}}}\, \left.m_0^2\right|_{F,D}\,.
\label{bmu11}
\end{equation}
Recalling our results for $m_0^2$, we realise that in the local limit the leading contribution to $B\hat\mu$ comes from F-terms
and scales as $\left.m_0^2\right|_F$ in (\ref{localscalar}). Hence the final result for $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{equation}
B\hat{\mu} = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{f_{H_u} f_{H_d}}}\, \frac{5\left(c_s-\frac 13\right)}{\omega'_S} m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}}{{V}}\right)\,.
\label{bmu11local}
\end{equation}

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: Similarly to the ultra-local limit for $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ defined by (\ref{ul}), we can define also an ultra-local limit
for $Z=\gamma(U,S)\tilde{K}$ as $Z\equiv z(U,S)\,e^{K/3}$ which implies
\begin{equation}
\label{fdef2}
\gamma(U,S) = \frac{z(U,S)\,e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2s)^{1/3}}\qquad \text{and}\qquad c_s=c_\dS=\frac 13\,.
\end{equation}
In this limit the F-term of $T_b$ does not contribute to $\hat\mu$ whose expression simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\label{mu2}
\hat\mu  =  - \frac{z\,s\partial_{s,u} \ln\gamma}{\sqrt{h_{H_u } h_{H_d}}}\,M_{1/2}\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}\right)\, .
\end{equation}
In this ultra-local case the expression (\ref{BmuKF}) for $\left.B\hat\mu\right|_F$ gives
\begin{equation}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_F = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u } h_{H_d}}}\left[\sigma(U,S) \,M_{1/2}^2-\frac 13 V_{F,0}\right]\,,
\label{Bmu2}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma(U,S)$ is a complicated ${O}(1)$ function of $S$ and $U$ which looks like
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma(U,S) &=& \frac 19 \left(1-s\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i}K_{\rm cs} \right)
\left[1 - 3 s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(h_{H_u} h_{H_d}\right)\right] \nonumber \\
&+& s \partial_{s,u} \ln \left(h_{H_u} h_{H_d}\right) s \partial_{s,u}\ln z- s^2\left[\partial_s \ln z \,\partial_{s,u} \ln \partial_s z
+\beta^{U_i} \partial_{u_i} \ln z \,\partial_{s,u} \ln \partial_{u_i} z\right]\,. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Recalling that $V_0 = V_{F,0} + V_{D,0}=0$, $V_{F,0}$ can be traded for $V_{D,0}$,
and so we shall include it in our analysis of D-term contributions to $B\hat\mu$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the dS case 1 of Sec.~\ref{matteruplift}, the D-term generated $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{equation}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_D = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\left.m_0^2\right|_D
= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\frac{6\epsilon_s}{\omega'_S}m_{3/2}M_{1/2}\sim  {O}\left(m_{3/2}^2\frac{\sqrt{\ln{V}}}{{V}}\right)\,,
\label{bmu2dS1}
\end{equation}
where we used the result in (\ref{sc1}). This term dominates over the F-term contribution given in (\ref{Bmu2}).

\item In the dS case 2 of Sec.~\ref{dilatonuplift}, the D-term generated $B\hat\mu$ is vanishing since
\begin{equation}
\left.B\hat\mu\right|_D = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\left.m_0^2\right|_D
= \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,2\left(c_\dS-\frac 13\right)V_{D,0}=0 \quad\text{for}\quad c_\dS=\frac 13\,,
\label{bmu2dS2}
\end{equation}
where we used the result in (\ref{Vds2}). Thus in this case $B\hat\mu$ is generated purely by F-terms and it is given by (\ref{Bmu2})
without the term proportional to $V_{F,0}$ that we included in the D-term contribution. Hence the final result for $B\hat\mu$ is
\begin{equation}
B\hat\mu = \frac{z}{\sqrt{h_{H_u} h_{H_d}}}\,\sigma(U,S) \,M_{1/2}^2\sim{O}\left(M_{1/2}^2\right)\,.
\label{Bmu22}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Superpotential contributions}\medskip\\
Let us discuss the contributions to $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ from $\mu\neq 0$ in $W_{\rm matter}$ given by (\ref{Wmatter}).
Their general expression in gravity mediation reads \cite{Brignole:1993dj}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{muW}
\hat{\mu} &=& \mu\,e^{K/2} \left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2}\,, \\
\label{BmuW}
B\hat{\mu} &=& \mu\,e^{K/2} \left[F^I \left(K_I + \partial_I \ln\mu - \partial_I \ln\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)\right) - m_{3/2}\right]\left(\tilde{K}_{H_u} \tilde{K}_{H_d}\right)^{-1/2}\,.
\end{eqnarray}

\medskip
\emph{Non-perturbative effects}: Non-perturbative effects can generate in the low-energy action an effective $\mu$-term of the form (up to prefactors)
\begin{equation}
W\supset e^{-a T} H_u H_d\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mu_{\rm eff} = e^{-a T}\,,
\label{Wnpmu}
\end{equation}
if the cycle $\tau={\rm Re}(T)$ is in the geometric regime \cite{Ibanez:2007tu} or
\begin{equation}
W\supset e^{-b \left(S+\kappa T\right)} H_u H_d\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mu_{\rm eff} = e^{-b\left(S+\kappa T\right)}\,,
\label{Wnpmu2}
\end{equation}
if the cycle $\tau={\rm Re}(T)$ is in the singular regime, i.e. $\tau\to 0$ \cite{Berenstein:2005xa}. Note that there are two distinct classes of non-perturbative contributions leading to the above EFT coupling: if the Higgs bi-linear is forbidden by anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries, charged instanton contributions for instance via ED3 can realise such a coupling~\cite{Ibanez:2007tu,Berenstein:2005xa}. Alternatively, if the Higgs-bilinear is forbidden by an approximate global symmetry of the local model, this global symmetry is broken by compactification effects. For the latter case, ref.~\cite{Berg:2012aq} studied the topological conditions under which non-perturbative effects of the form (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2})
contribute to the effective action. If $T$ is a bulk cycle, the coupling (\ref{Wnpmu}) is always generated but in our case it would be negligible since this effect would be proportional to $e^{-{V}^{2/3}}$. On the other hand, if $T$ is the blow-up of a local singularity, the couplings (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2})
get generated only if this divisor shares a homologous two-cycle with the blow-up mode $T_\SM$ of the MSSM singularity.
This condition is not satisfied if either $T$ or $T_\SM$ is a very simple divisor like a dP$_0$ which has been used in the explicit global models of \cite{Cicoli:2012vw} and \cite{Cicoli:2013cha}.

If in both cases the appropriate conditions are satisfied, both (\ref{Wnpmu}) and (\ref{Wnpmu2}) would lead to a non-vanishing contribution which can be parameterised as follows
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mu} \simeq \frac{c_\mu(U,S)}{{V}^{n+\frac 13}}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
B \hat{\mu} \simeq \frac{c_B(U,S)}{{V}^{n+ \frac 43}}\,,
\label{mumag}
\end{equation}
where in (\ref{Wnpmu}) we have set $T=T_s$ and $a=n a_s$ with $n>0$, while in (\ref{Wnpmu2}) we have parameterised $b=n a_s$
recalling that $s\simeq \tau_s$ from (\ref{tausms}). $c_{\mu}$ and $c_B$ are constants which absorb the dependence on the prefactor of the instanton contribution, the complex structure moduli and the dilaton. Note that for different values of $n$ non-perturbative effects could generate $\hat{\mu}$ and $B \hat{\mu}$ in the complete range interesting for MSSM phenomenology regardless of the size of the other soft-terms.
However these effects can be in competition with K\"ahler potential contributions for $n \geq 5/3$.\\

\emph{Background fluxes}: Primitive $(1,2)$ IASD fluxes
can generate $\hat\mu$ for D3-branes at singularities \cite{Grana:2002nq,Camara:2003ku,Grana:2003ek}.
However, given that their contribution is proportional to the F-terms of the complex structure moduli,
this effect has already been included in the contributions from the K\"ahler potential. In other words, direct computations of soft terms
by reducing the D3-brane action in a fluxed background show that $\mu=0$ \cite{Grana:2003ek}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries}\medskip\\
A term proportional to $H_u H_d$ in $K$ or $W$ could be forbidden in the presence of an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry.
In this case, the only way to generate a Higgs bilinear would be to multiply this term by an operator involving a $U(1)$-charged field
which makes the whole contribution gauge invariant. As already discussed above, the only closed string moduli that can lead to such an effect are K\"ahler moduli.

Alternatively, the $U(1)$-charged field could be an open string mode $\Phi$ appearing in $K$ and $W$
in a gauge invariant combination of the form ($\Lambda$ denotes the appropriate moduli-dependent cut-off)
\begin{equation}
K\supset \left(\frac{\Phi}{\Lambda}\right)^n H_u H_d\,,\quad \quad W\supset\frac{\Phi^n}{\Lambda^{n-1}} H_u H_d\,.
\label{KWphi}
\end{equation}
Thus the field $\Phi$ has to be an MSSM singlet since a Higgs bilinear gets generated only when $\Phi$ develops a non-zero VEV breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry.
However, as can be seen from eqs. (\ref{dtermpot}) and (\ref{xiSM}), D-term stabilisation fixes the VEV of $\Phi$
in terms of $\tau_\SM$: $|\Phi|^2 \propto \tau_\SM/{V}$,
and so the couplings in (\ref{KWphi}) would give rise to effective $\mu$ and $Z$-terms which depend only on closed string moduli
\begin{equation}
Z_{\rm eff}\propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^n}\left(\frac{\tau_\SM}{{V}}\right)^{n/2}\,,
\quad \quad\mu_{\rm eff}\propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^{n-1}}\left(\frac{\tau_\SM}{{V}}\right)^{n/2}\,.
\label{Eff}
\end{equation}
Once the cut-off $\Lambda$ is explicitly written in terms of $T$-moduli, one could plug (\ref{Eff})
into the standard supergravity formulae to work out the final contribution to $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$.
The result will depend on the VEV and the F-term of $T_\SM$. As discussed in \cite{Cicoli:2013cha},
$\Phi$ needs to receive tachyonic contribution from soft terms in order for $T_\SM$ to develop a non-zero VEV.
If this condition is satisfied, $\tau_\SM \sim {V}^{-1}$ implying $F^{T_\SM}\sim {V}^{-2}$ for the local case
and $\tau_\SM \sim {V}^{-3}$ implying $F^{T_\SM}\sim {V}^{-4}$ for the ultra-local case.
This effect corresponds to switching on an FI-term, and so to breaking the anomalous $U(1)$ by moving slightly away from the singularity.
However in both cases the VEV of $\tau_\SM$ is smaller than unity, and so we are still consistently in the singular regime.

Given that all these results are clearly model-dependent and require physics beyond the MSSM,
at this stage we do not pursue these options in more detail and leave them for future work.
Let us just mention that the only case where the effective $\mu$-term in (\ref{Eff}) does not
depend on $\Lambda$ is for $n=1$. In this situation $\hat\mu$ would scale as ${V}^{-4/3}$ in the local case and as ${V}^{-7/3}$ in the ultra-local case.
If instead $\Phi$ does not receive tachyonic contributions from soft terms,
another option would be to consider models where $\Phi$ develops a non-zero VEV because of radiative effects.

\subsection{Summary of soft-terms}

Let us summarise our results for the soft-terms in the two cases to obtain dS vacua (see also Table \ref{Table1}).
Given that in each case the gaugino masses turn out to have the same value,
we will use $M_{1/2}$ as a useful parameter which can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2} = c_{1/2} m_{3/2} \frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}\left[\ln\left(\frac{M_P}{m_{3/2}}\right)\right]^{3/2}\ll m_{3/2}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $c_{1/2}$ is a flux-dependent tunable coefficient.
We will state our results for the model-independent case where $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ are generated
from moduli induced K\"ahler potential contributions. If these contributions are absent (for example if these terms are forbidden by anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries), then $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ can take different values because of model-dependent contributions from either $K$ or $W$
as discussed in Sec.~\ref{bmusection}. Let us discuss the local and ultra-local limits separately.

\medskip
\emph{Local limit}: In the local limit, the soft-terms turn out to be the same in both dS mechanisms
(all the $c$'s are flux-dependent parameters)
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = c_0\,m_{3/2} M_{1/2}\,,\quad A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,,
\quad\hat\mu= c_\mu\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad B\hat\mu = c_B m_0^2\,.
\end{equation}

\medskip
\emph{Ultra-local limit}: In the ultra-local limit, the soft-terms take different forms in the two dS cases
(again all the $c$'s are flux-dependent coefficients which are distinct in different scenarios)
\begin{enumerate}
\item dS vacua from hidden matter fields
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = c_{0}\,\frac{m_{3/2}M_{1/2}}{\ln\left(M_P/m_{3/2}\right)}\,,\quad A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,,
\quad\hat\mu= c_\mu\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad B\hat\mu = c_{B} m_0^2\,;
\end{equation}
\item dS vacua from non-perturbative effects at singularities
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha = (c_{0})_\alpha\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,,
\quad\hat\mu= c_\mu\,M_{1/2}\,,\quad B\hat\mu = c_{B} M_{1/2}^2\,.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
Clearly, the local limit and the dS case 1 for the ultra-local limit correspond to typical (mini) split SUSY scenarios whereas
the dS case 2 for the ultra-local limit reproduces a standard MSSM picture with universal gaugino masses and soft masses all of the same order. If the flux dependent coefficients for the scalar masses are universal $(c_0)_\alpha=c_0,$ a standard CMSSM scenario emerges. Non-universalities in the flux dependent coefficients can lead to interesting soft-term patterns such as in NUHM or natural SUSY scenarios. We will study in detail the LHC phenomenology
of these different scenarios in a subsequent paper~\cite{us}.

\end{table}

For illustrative purposes, we just mention here two simple benchmark models for the dS case 2 in the ultra-local limit.
Setting all the $\beta$'s to zero, we find

\medskip
\emph{Benchmark model 1: $h_\alpha=z=1$}
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha \simeq 0\,\,\,\forall\alpha\,,\quad A_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = (c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\,M_{1/2}\,,
\quad\hat\mu= \frac{M_{1/2}}{3} \,,\quad B\hat\mu = \hat\mu^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $(c_A)_{\alpha\beta\gamma}=s\partial_s \ln Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$.
This reproduces a typical gaugino mediation scenario \cite{Schmaltz:2000gy,Yanagida:2013ah}.

\medskip
\emph{Benchmark model 2: $f_\alpha=\gamma=1$}
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha = m_0 = \frac{M_{1/2}}{\sqrt{3}}\,\,\,\forall\alpha\,,\quad A = -\sqrt{3}\,m_0\,,
\quad\hat\mu \simeq \frac{m_0}{\ln\left(M_P/m_{3/2}\right)}\,,\quad B\hat\mu = m_0^2\,,
\end{equation}
if the holomorphic Yukawas do not depend on $S$.
This leads to a typical natural SUSY scenario for example
if we allow $m_{H_u}$ to be slightly larger than $m_0$ together with a light third generation~\cite{Baer:2012uy}.
This can be done by considering the more general case with non-zero
$\beta$'s and allowing for a $U$-dependence in $f_\alpha$. The $\ln\left(M_P/m_{3/2}\right)$ suppression of $\hat\mu$ with respect to $m_0$ comes from subleading contributions to $\hat\mu$ from $F^{T_s}$.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we have analysed soft-terms for LVS sequestered models with dS moduli stabilisation.
These models are particularly attractive for phenomenological reasons: the string scale is
around the GUT scale, soft masses are at the TeV scale and the lightest modulus is much heavier than the bound imposed by the cosmological moduli problem.
The volume of the compactification is of order ${V}\sim 10^7$ in string units and the visible sector can be localised on D3-branes at a singularity.

The pattern of soft terms for these models has been previously studied in \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk}. In this paper we have deepened the analysis of \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk} by studying the effect on soft terms of the sector responsible to realise a dS vacuum, and by classifying in a systematic way any possible correction to the leading no-scale structure of soft terms. In particular, given that soft terms depend on the moduli-dependence of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields $\tilde{K}_\alpha$, we defined two possible limits for $\tilde{K}_\alpha$: \emph{Local scenarios} where $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ is such that the visible sector Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ do not depend on ${V}$ only at leading order in an inverse volume expansion, and \emph{Ultra-local scenarios} where $Y_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ are exactly independent on ${V}$ at all orders.\footnote{Evidence in favour of ultralocality has been obtained from explicit string computations in toroidal orbifolds \cite{Conlon:2011jq}.
The case of realistic CY compactifications remains to be explored.} Moreover, due to the present lack of explicit string computations of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$, we parameterised its dependence on the dilaton and complex structure moduli as an unknown function $f_\alpha(U,S)$.

The computation of soft terms has produced a wide range of phenomenological possibilities depending on the exact moduli-dependence of the matter K\"ahler metric and the way to achieve a dS vacuum. We considered two dS realisations based on supersymmetric effective actions: \emph{dS case 1} where hidden sector matter fields living on a bulk cycle develop non-vanishing F-terms because of D-term fixing, and \emph{dS case 2} where the blow-up mode of a singularity different from the visible sector one develops non-zero F-terms due to non-perturbative effects.
Broadly speaking, we found two classes of models:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Split SUSY}: Local models and ultra-local models in the dS case 1 yield gaugino masses and A-terms which are suppressed with respect to scalar masses: $M_{1/2} \sim m_{3/2}\epsilon\ll m_0 \sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}\ll m_{3/2}$
    for $\epsilon \sim m_{3/2}/M_P\ll 1$. For volumes of order of $10^7$ in string units these models provide a version of the split SUSY scenario with a `largish' splitting between gauginos and scalars (according to current experimental bounds). Non-universalities are present but suppressed by inverse powers of the volume.

\item \emph{Standard MSSM}: For ultra-local models in the dS case 2, all soft-terms are of the same order: $M_{1/2} \sim m_0 \sim m_{3/2}\epsilon\ll m_{3/2}$.
Therefore these models include the CMSSM parameter space and its possible generalisations since each soft-term comes along with a tunable flux-dependent coefficient. Moreover, depending on the exact functional dependence of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields, these models can also feature non-universalities which are constrained by the experimental bounds on flavour changing neutral currents.
\end{enumerate}

Let us stress again that the exact numerical coefficients of the soft terms are functions of the dilaton and complex structure moduli which are fixed in terms of flux quanta. Hence soft terms vary as one scans through the string landscape. This crucial property of our scenarios gives supersymmetric models the freedom to perform any tuning which is needed for phenomenological reasons. In particular, it is low energy SUSY that addresses the hierarchy problem by stabilising the Higgs mass at the weak scale, while scanning through the landscape provides small variations in the size of soft terms as necessary to reproduce all the detailed features of experimental data. This tuning at low energies can be viewed as a choice of parameters in the high scale theory. There is a large freedom of choice in the high scale theory which is however not arbitrary since this freedom is provided by the theory itself (by having a computable landscape of vacua).

Note that in the ultra-local case the two ways to achieve a dS vacuum give rise to a different pattern of soft terms. This can intuitively be understood as follows: the depth of the LVS AdS vacuum is of order $m_{3/2}^2\epsilon$, and so any extra term which yields a dS solution has to be of this order of magnitude. In turn, if the field $\phi$ responsible for dS uplifting is not decoupled from the visible sector, scalar masses of order $m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}$ are expected to arise because of this new contribution to the scalar potential. This is actually what happens in the dS case 1 since $\phi$ lives on a bulk cycle, and so it is not decoupled from the visible sector. On the other hand, in the dS case 2 $\phi$ lives on a singularity which is geometrically separated from the one supporting the visible sector. This gives rise to an effective decoupling between $\phi$ and the visible sector, resulting in suppressed scalar masses.

We would also like to emphasise that our analysis for the dS case 1, together with~\cite{Cicoli:2012vw}
(which provided visible sector models embedded in moduli stabilised compact CYs),
provides a very comprehensive study of SUSY breaking in string theory.

The soft terms which are more complicated to estimate are the $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms since they receive contributions from both the K\"ahler potential and the superpotential. Moreover, these contributions could generically be forbidden in models with branes at singularities because of the presence of anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries. In this case, effective $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms could still be generated due to non-perturbative corrections (e.g. D-brane instantons) or matter fields which develop non-vanishing VEVs. However in this last case, besides the need to go beyond the MSSM by including additional matter fields, any prediction for $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms would necessarily be model-dependent.

Overall, we are living exciting times with plenty of feedback from experiments. A detailed study of the phenomenology of the general sequestered scenarios mentioned above will be presented in a follow-up article \cite{us}.

\appendix


\section{Subleading corrections to F-terms}
\label{App}

In this appendix we first describe the shift of the LVS minimum after including an extra term responsible to achieve a dS vacuum,
and then provide subleading corrections to F-terms. As described in Sec.~\ref{dsv}, the mechanism which realises a dS vacuum gives rise effectively to an extra term of the form
\begin{equation}
V_\dS=\frac{r}{{V}^m}\qquad\text{with}\quad r>0\quad\text{and}\quad m<3\,.
\end{equation}
We are interested in minimising the combined system
\begin{equation}
V=V_{{O}({V}^{-3})}+V_\dS\,,
\end{equation}
with the additional constraint of vanishing vacuum energy. This constraint relates the coefficient $r$ with the tunable flux parameters in the LVS potential such as $W_0$ or $g_s$. A concrete dS scenario, such as the ones in Sec.~\ref{dsv}, typically fixes $r$ by construction with only moderate tuning. However the real tuning can be achieved by simply tuning the flux superpotential and the string coupling in agreement with the flux landscape.

The expressions for the moduli VEVs are largely independent on the way to get dS vacua.
In fact, the relation (\ref{eataus}) is generic whereas the expression (\ref{tausms}) for the VEV of $\tau_s$
depends on the way to get a dS vacuum. The exact minimum for $\tau_s$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\tau_s^{3/2}=\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\, \frac{(1-\epsilon_s)^2}{(1-4\epsilon_s)}\, \frac{1}{1+\frac{2m}{m-3} \epsilon_s}
=\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}\left[1+f_\dS(\epsilon_s)\right]\,,
\label{eq:shiftds}
\end{equation}
and so the function $f_\dS$ is $f_\dS= 18 \epsilon_s+297 \epsilon_s^2$ in the case of dS vacua from hidden matter fields ($m=8/3$),
while $f_\dS=3 \epsilon_s+12 \epsilon_s^2$ for the case of non-perturbative effects at singularities ($m=1$).
Note that as a consequence of the shift in $\tau_s$, also the overall volume in (\ref{eataus}) is shifted and, as the shift is in the exponential,
this shift can be parametrically large.

Equipped with the minimum, we can evaluate the F-terms. To simplify the notation we factor out an overall factor of the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ which is given by (\ref{expandm32}). The F-terms turn out to have the following expressions:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{F^{T_b}}{\tau_b}&=&-2 m_{3/2}\left[1+\frac{9 \hat{\xi} \epsilon_s}{4 {V}} \frac{m-1}{m-3+2m\epsilon_s} +{O}\left(\frac{1}{{V}^2}\right)\right]\,, \\
\frac{F^{T_s}}{\tau_s}&=& -2 m_{3/2}\left[\frac{3\epsilon_s}{(1-\epsilon_s)}-\frac{\hat{\xi}}{2{V}}
\left(1-\frac{9\epsilon_s}{2}\frac{m-1}{m-3}+{O}\left(\epsilon_s^2\right)\right)\right]\,, \\
\frac{F^S}{s}&=& \frac{3 \omega'_S }{8 a_s^{3/2}}  \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}\epsilon_s^{3/2}}\left[1+{O}\left(\epsilon_s\right)\right]\,, \\
F^U&=& - \frac{K^{U_i \overline{U}_{\overline{j}}}}{2 s^2}\frac{\omega_{\overline{U}_{\overline{j}}}}{\omega'_S}F^S\equiv \beta^{U_i}\,F^S\,, \\
F^{\phi_\dS} &=& \phi_\dS m_{3/2}\left[1+ {O}\left(\frac{1}{{V}}\right)\right] \,, \\
F^{T_{\dS}}&=& \frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}a_s^{3/4}}\frac{m_{3/2}}{\epsilon_s^{1/4}}\left[1+{O}\left(\epsilon_s\right)\right]\,.
\end{eqnarray}


\section{Possible sources of desequestering}
\label{sec:deseq}

There is a general belief that in any supergravity theory once SUSY is broken all sparticles should get a mass at least of the order of the scale determined by the split in the gravity multiplet. In particular, all soft masses are expected to be of order the gravitino mass. Furthermore, if for some reason some of the sparticle masses are found to be smaller than $m_{3/2}$ at tree level, since SUSY no longer protects these masses against quantum corrections, they should be lifted to a loop factor times $m_{3/2}$. So soft masses are expected to be at most one order of magnitude lighter than the gravitino mass but not much smaller.\footnote{This separation between $m_{3/2}$ and soft masses occurs for example in the case of mirage (mixed moduli and anomaly) mediation~\cite{LoaizaBrito:2005fa}.}
Effects which tend to push the soft masses to the scale of the gravitino mass are referred to as sources of desequestering.
In this appendix we will argue that our models can be stable against desequestering effects.

\subsection{Loop corrections}

For sequestered string scenarios, it is natural to expect that loop corrections bring soft masses to a magnitude of order a loop factor times $m_{3/2}$. However there can be exceptions since the couplings can be Planck suppressed. A detailed calculation of loop corrections to the mass of bulk scalars like the volume modulus (its tree level mass $m_{V} \sim m_{3/2}/{V}^{1/2}$ is hierarchically smaller than $m_{3/2}$) was presented in~\cite{Burgess:2010sy}.

The size of loop corrections can be estimated by realising that, if SUSY is broken,
loop corrections to the mass should be given by the heaviest particles circulating in the loop
(or the cut-off scale) which is the Kaluza-Klein scale $M_\KK\sim M_P/{V}^{2/3}$.
In the absence of SUSY there is a need of a SUSY breaking insertion (a spurion field representing the relevant F-term)
in the loop and the correction to the mass is at most
\begin{equation}
\delta m=\alpha_\lp \frac{M_\KK m_{3/2}}{M_P}\sim \alpha_\lp\frac{W_0}{{V}^{5/3}}\ll \alpha_\lp m_{3/2}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\alpha_\lp\sim g^2/(16\pi^2)$ a loop factor. Note that the ratio $\delta m/m\sim \alpha_\lp {V}^{-1/6}$ is very small
and therefore the volume modulus mass is stable against loop corrections.

For matter fields located at the SM brane, loop corrections should be even further suppressed.
The effective field theory on the brane is supersymmetric and feels the effects of SUSY breaking in the bulk only via Planck suppressed couplings.
Therefore masses as small as $M_{\rm soft}\sim W_0/{V}^2$ are still stable under standard loop corrections
(since volume suppressed brane-bulk couplings imply $\delta M_{\rm soft}\ll \delta m$).

Over the years explicit calculations have been performed estimating loop corrections to soft masses in no-scale
and general gravity mediated models. See for example \cite{Ellis:1986nr,Antoniadis:1997ic}
in which loop corrections to scalar and gaugino masses were estimated in supergravity and M-theory frameworks with results of order
$\delta m \sim \alpha_\lp m_{3/2}^2/M_P\sim \alpha_\lp M_P/{V}^2$. More recently, explicit calculations for gravitino loop contributions to gaugino masses was performed in \cite{Lee:2013aia}. The diagrams are quadratically divergent and proportional to the gravitino mass:
\begin{equation}
\delta M_{1/2} = \frac{m_{3/2}}{16\pi^2}\left(\frac{\Lambda^2}{M_P^2}+\dots\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the cut-off scale and the dots represent subleading logarithmically divergent terms.
In string theory we expect that $\Lambda\leq M_s\sim M_P/{V}^{1/2}$ which then corrects the gaugino masses to order
$\delta M_{1/2}\leq \alpha_\lp M_P/{V}^2$ which is smaller than the sequestered gaugino masses $M_{1/2}\sim M_P/{V}^2$.

This behaviour of sequestered models motivated the work of Randall and Sundrum to introduce anomaly mediation.
However, as we will illustrate below, the approximate no-scale structure of LVS makes anomaly mediated corrections
to soft-terms subleading (they vanish identically for no-scale models) in generic points of parameter space.


\subsection{Anomaly mediated contributions}
\label{anosec}

In this appendix we examine anomaly mediated contributions to soft-terms and compute their strength
in the dS constructions discussed in Sec.~\ref{dsv}. The anomaly mediated gaugino masses~\cite{Bagger:1999rd} are given by\footnote{Note that there is a certain discussion on the validity of this formula~\cite{deAlwis:2008aq}. For the purpose of this paper we assume that the standard derivation from field theory or string theory~\cite{Conlon:2010qy} is valid.}
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}=\frac{g^2}{16 \pi^2}\left[\left(T_R-3T_G\right)m_{3/2}+\left(T_G-T_R\right)F^I\partial_I K
+\frac{2T_R}{d_R}F^I\partial_I\ln\det \tilde{K}_{\alpha\beta}\right],
\label{eq:anomalygauginomasses}
\end{equation}
where $T_{G,R}$ are the Dynkin indices of the adjoint representation
and the matter representation $R$ of dimension $d_R$ (summation over all matter representations is understood).
Assuming that the K\"ahler metric for matter fields can be written as $\tilde{K}_{\alpha\beta}=\delta_{\alpha\beta} f_\alpha\tilde{K}$,
the expression (\ref{eq:anomalygauginomasses}) reduces to
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}=\frac{g^2}{16 \pi^2}\left[\left(T_R-3T_G\right)m_{3/2}+\left(T_G-T_R\right)F^I\partial_I K
+\frac{2T_R}{\tilde{K}} F^I\partial_I\tilde{K}+\frac{2T_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} F^I\partial_I\ln f_\alpha\right].
\label{eq:anomalygauginomasses2}
\end{equation}
In the local case, we find that the leading order anomaly mediated contribution can be written in terms
of the modulus dominated gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ given in (\ref{ggmm})
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom} = \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} \left[\left(T_R - T_G\right)\left(1-s\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i} K_{\rm cs}\right)
- \frac{4 T_R}{\omega_S'} \left(c_s-\frac 13 \right)+\frac{2sT_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} \partial_{s,u}\ln f_\alpha\right] M_{1/2},
\label{anorel}
\end{equation}
with $\omega_S'$ as defined below (\ref{ds}). For the ultra-local case we find instead
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}^{\rm anom} = \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} \left[\left(\frac{T_R}{3} - T_G\right)\left(1-s\beta^{U_i}\partial_{u_i} K_{\rm cs}\right)
+\frac{2sT_R}{d_R}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{d_R} \partial_{s,u}\ln h_\alpha\right] M_{1/2}\, .
\label{anorel2}
\end{equation}
Therefore in both cases the anomaly mediated contribution is loop suppressed with respect to the moduli mediated one.
This result is the consequence of the approximate no-scale structure of LVS models.

A more careful analysis is needed for a very particular point in the underlying parameter space:
$\omega_S' \to 0$, i.e. in the very tuned situation where the F-term of the dilaton is vanishing at leading order because of a special compensation between the contribution to $F^S$ from $D_S W$ and $D_{T_b} W$. In this case the leading contribution to gaugino masses given in (\ref{ggmm}) is zero and the first non-vanishing moduli mediated contribution can be estimated to scale as $M_{1/2}^{\rm new}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\ln{V}}/{V} $. On the other hand, the anomaly mediated contribution scales as $M_{1/2}^{\rm anom}\sim c \,M_{1/2}^{\rm new}$ where $c = c' \left(\frac{g^2}{16\pi^2}\right) \ln{V}$ and $c'$ denotes a numerical factor arising from evaluating~\eqref{anorel2} exactly.
For $g\simeq 0.1$ and ${V} \simeq 5\cdot 10^6$ (the value needed to get $M_{1/2}^{\rm new}$ approximately around the TeV-scale), $c$ is roughly of order $c'\times10^{-3}.$ Depending on the exact value of $c',$ which is beyond the scope of this analysis, we can achieve competing contributions from moduli mediation and anomaly mediation.


\subsection{Moduli redefinitions}

Desequestering can also potentially occur due to moduli redefinitions which might be necessary
order by order in perturbation theory. This desequestering effect can for example arise due to a shift of the local cycle $\tau_\SM\rightarrow \tau_\SM+\alpha\ln{V}$ which has the effect of making the soft-terms of the same order as the gravitino mass~\cite{Conlon:2010ji,Choi:2010gm}.

Such moduli redefinitions depend on the structure of the D-brane configuration. In particular, it has been argued that redefinitions are absent for configurations involving only D3-branes at orbifold singularities but are present for D3-branes at orientifold singularities
and in cases with both D3- and D7-branes (see~\cite{Conlon:2010ji}).

We emphasise that desequestering occurs only if the moduli redefinition leads to a change in the functional form of the K\"ahler potential. Arguments suggesting a change in the functional form were presented in \cite{Conlon:2010ji} but an explicit computation of such a change is still not available in the
literature. Some recent explicit computations of the K\"ahler potential \cite{Grimm:2013bha, Junghans:2014zla} have shown that perturbative corrections can be such that, along with a field redefinition, there is also an additional term generated in the K\"ahler potential. In these cases, however,
the two effects conspire to leave the functional form of the K\"ahler potential invariant.
More detailed studies of perturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential are crucial to get a comprehensive understanding  of the relationship between moduli redefinitions and desequestering.

\subsection{Superpotential desequestering}

Apart from potentially destroying the hierarchy between soft masses and $m_{3/2}$,
various subleading effects can have important phenomenological consequences.
Interesting constraints arise from non-perturbative terms in the
superpotential involving visible sector fields \cite{Berg:2010ha}. Superpotential terms of the type
\begin{equation}
\label{sud}
\hat{W} = \left( \hat{\mu} H_u H_d + \hat {\lambda}^u_{ij} Q^i u^j H_u
+ \hat {\lambda}^d_{ij}  Q^i d^j H_d + \hat {\lambda}^u_{ij} L^i e^j H_d \right) e^{-a_s T_s}\,,
\end{equation}
would lead to flavour violation and CP-violation via A-terms with a strength sensitive to the hierarchy between soft masses and $m_{3/2}$.
For $M_{\rm soft}^2 \sim m_{3/2}^2/{V}^n$ the strength of CP and flavour violation induced by A-terms would be
\begin{equation}
\label{flav}
\delta \sim  {V}^n   10^{-16} \left( {v \over 100 \phantom{.} {\rm GeV}} \right)\,,
\end{equation}
with $v$ equal to the Higgs VEV. CP violation and FCNC bounds then require
${V} < 10^5$. This gives a slight tension with our results but there can be several ways around this
issue. The estimate~(\ref{flav}) is based on effective field theory arguments; it assumes generic order one coefficients for the superpotential terms in (\ref{sud}).  A  string computation
of  the coefficients was done in \cite{Berg:2012aq}. This indicates that the coefficients are suppressed unless
the SM cycle and the cycle on which the instanton is supported share a homologous two-cycle. The presence of flavour symmetries \cite{1106.6039,1002.1790,1111.3047, 0810.5660} in the visible sector can also alleviate
this tension.

\section{Introduction}

\textit{Dark Matter} (DM) constitutes around $\sim 25\%$ of the current energy density of our Universe~\cite{Bertone:2016nfn}. 
Yet, we understand very few of its properties -- it  interacts very weakly with standard matter and most of it cannot be relativistic. Its fundamental nature remains unknown.
The mass range of the currently proposed DM constituents varies from the $10^{-20} \, \text{eV}$ of ultra-light axions~\cite{Hu:2000ke, Amendola:2005ad, Hui:2016ltb} to the tens of solar masses of the heaviest \textit{Primordial Black Holes} (PBHs)~\cite{zel1967hypothesis, Hawking:1971ei, Carr:1974nx, Carr:1975qj, Chapline:1975ojl}. PBHs, in particular, represent an appealing candidate as this scenario may not require any particle beyond the Standard Model. 


 A necessary ingredient for PBHs to constitute DM is the existence of sizeable small-scale perturbations in the early Universe.
In the standard PBH formation model, the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced by some mechanism operating during inflation (see, for example, Ref.~\cite{Sasaki:2018dmp} for a review). 
Explicit examples include: 
double inflation~\cite{Silk:1986vc, Kawasaki:1997ju, Kannike:2017bxn,Ashoorioon:2020hln}, inflection points in the inflationary potential~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:1996mdl, Alabidi:2009bk, Clesse:2015wea, Garcia-Bellido:2017mdw, Ballesteros:2017fsr, Hertzberg:2017dkh, Motohashi:2017kbs, Ballesteros:2020qam}, 
curvaton models~\cite{Kawasaki:2012wr, Carr:2017edp}, 
axion inflation models~\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw, Domcke:2017fix,Ozsoy:2018flq}. 
Other non-standard scenarios invoke, for instance, 
preheating effects~\cite{Green:2000he, Bassett:2000ha, Martin:2019nuw, Muia:2019coe, Cotner:2019ykd, Nazari:2020fmk}, 
early matter-domination~\cite{Green:1997pr, Harada:2016mhb, Krippendorf:2018tei, deJong:2021bbo, Padilla:2021zgm, DeLuca:2021pls, Das:2021wad}, collapse of cosmic strings~\cite{Polnarev:1988dh, Garriga:1993gj, Caldwell:1995fu, MacGibbon:1997pu, Helfer:2018qgv, Jenkins:2020ctp}
and late-forming PBHs \cite{Chakraborty:2022mwu}. 
As modes are stretched on super-horizon scales during inflation, curvature perturbations 
freeze-out until they re-enter the horizon during the post-inflationary epoch. At this point, if the amplitude of perturbations is larger than the threshold~\cite{Musco:2004ak, Polnarev:2006aa, Musco:2008hv, Musco:2012au, Musco:2018rwt, Kehagias:2019eil, Musco:2020jjb, Musco:2021sva}, they can collapse forming a population of PBHs with masses controlled by the energy contained in a Hubble volume. 
Various observations already constrain the fraction of DM composed of PBHs (usually denoted $f_{\text{\tiny PBH}} \equiv \Omega_\text{\tiny PBH}/\Omega_\text{\tiny DM}$). The bounds cover a wide spectrum of phenomenologically interesting range of PBH masses. We provide a summary of these in Fig.~\ref{fig: Constraints}, see  Ref.~\cite{Carr:2020gox} for a detailed recent review. 
The possibility of DM being constituted fully by PBHs is still allowed only in the so-called \textit{asteroidal} mass range $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \subset(10^{-16}\div 10^{-10}) \, M_\odot$~\cite{Katz:2018zrn, Montero-Camacho:2019jte},
where $M_{\odot} \simeq 2 \times 10^{33} \, {\rm g}$ denotes the mass of the Sun.
However, one should  keep in mind that many of the constraints in Fig.~\ref{fig: Constraints} are derived under specific assumptions, hence it is important to provide complementary and independent probes of potential light PBH populations.

\end{figure}


The recent detection of \textit{Gravitational Waves} (GWs) by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2014jea,TheVirgo:2014hva} has turned out to be a novel powerful tool for the investigation of PBHs as DM. 
Soon after the very first GW detections, it was shown that PBHs could explain the observed GW signals while complying with the cosmological bound requiring them to be at most as abundant as the entirety of the DM~\cite{Bird:2016dcv,Clesse:2016vqa,Sasaki:2016jop}. 
By now, results from the various runs of observations set the most stringent constraints on $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$ in the solar mass range~\cite{Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Raidal:2018bbj,Vaskonen:2019jpv,DeLuca:2020bjf, Hall:2020daa,DeLuca:2020sae,Wong:2020yig,Hutsi:2020sol,DeLuca:2021wjr}, 
while they may still account for a fraction of the GW events~\cite{Franciolini:2021tla,Franciolini:2021xbq,Franciolini:2022iaa}. 


The frequency of GWs emitted from BH mergers is tied to the \textit{Innermost Stable Circular Orbit} (ISCO) frequency
 \begin{equation}
\label{eq:fISCO}
f_\text{\tiny ISCO} \simeq  4.4 \times 10^3 \, {\rm Hz} \lp \frac{M_{\odot}}{m_1 + m_2} \rp,
\end{equation} 
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two BHs.\footnote{The top frame of Fig.~\ref{fig: Constraints} reports the ISCO frequency that corresponds to a given BH mass (taking $m_1 = m_2$ for simplicity).}
Given Eq.~\eqref{eq:fISCO}, it is clear that ground-based interferometers such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA can only probe the final phase of mergers with masses slightly above the stellar mass.
One sees from Fig.~\ref{fig: Constraints} that high-frequency GW experiments extending beyond the kHz range are best suited to search for light PBHs
characterized by masses below $1 \, M_{\odot}$ corresponding to ISCO frequencies in the \textit{Ultra-High-Frequency} (UHF) band, i.e. to $f_\text{\tiny ISCO} > 10^3 \, \rm{Hz}$. 
In particular, the asteroidal mass window where PBHs are currently allowed to be the entirety of the DM corresponds to a maximum frequency above $f\gtrsim 10^{15} {\rm Hz}$.
Therefore, it is of great importance to extend our experimental capabilities beyond the $\rm{kHz}$. 


Furthermore, there is no known astrophysical object that can produce GWs at a frequency higher than $\mathcal{O}(10) \, \rm{kHz}$. The absence of astrophysical contaminations implies that UHF-GW detectors can
potentially serve as  clean probes of new physics~\cite{Maggiore:1999vm, Aggarwal:2020olq}. Note that beyond the \textit{Stochastic GW Background} (SGWB) produced by unresolved PBH mergers, there are  a plethora of early Universe GW production mechanisms that can give rise to a stochastic signal in the UHF-GW band. All of these would  imply physics beyond the  \textit{ Standard Model} (SM) of particle physics.

The experimental status of UHF-GW searches is currently in a very preliminary stage. 
Several proposals exist, planning to cover the frequency range $(10^4 \div 10^{15}) \, \text{Hz}$ almost entirely. 
Some of the proposals have already been implemented in the form of prototypes or actual detectors, see Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors} and Ref.~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq} for more details. Yet, none of these are able to reach the required sensitivity to detect a cosmologically motivated GW signal. 
One of the goals of this paper is to critically assess the possibility of detecting GWs produced by a population of light PBHs potentially explaining a large fraction of the DM.

The paper is structured as follows. 
%
In Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers} we review the theory of PBH mergers, 
including a discussion on the computation of the merger rate of binaries formed in the early Universe as well as an estimate of the maximum theoretical merger rate that may be attained in strongly clustered PBH scenarios. 
We include the enhancement due to the local (i.e. galactic) DM overdensity and recap how to estimate expected signal strain and duration. 
Then, we review the properties of the SGWB produced by unresolved PBH mergers, while also computing the memory effect and light boson superradiance.
%
In Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors}, we review the current status of the experimental efforts to detect GWs at high-frequencies, including already operating detectors and various recent proposals, discussing which effort may be more promising for probing light PBHs.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}, we provide some future outlook and conclude.

\section{Gravitational wave signatures of Primordial Black Holes}
\label{sec:PBHmergers}

A population of PBHs formed in the early Universe is expected to produce a variety of GW signals, see Refs.~\cite{Green:2020jor,Carr:2020xqk,Franciolini:2021nvv} for recent reviews. 
In this section we summarise the main predictions of the PBH model, providing a derivation for the benchmark quantities used in the upcoming section where 
an assessment of the detectability of GW signals produced by light PBHs is presented. 

\subsection{Gravitational waves from PBH formation and evaporation}

PBHs may form at very high redshift \cite{zel1967hypothesis,Hawking:1974rv,Chapline:1975ojl,Carr:1975qj,Ivanov:1994pa,GarciaBellido:1996qt,Ivanov:1997ia,Blinnikov:2016bxu} if the density perturbations overcome the threshold for collapse \cite{Musco:2020jjb,Escriva:2021aeh}. 
Their mass $m_\text{\tiny PBH}$ is comparable to the mass contained in the cosmological horizon at the time of formation.
In particular, the scaling law relating $m_\text{\tiny PBH}$ to the horizon mass $m_\text{\tiny H}$ for overdensities close to the critical threshold for collapse is \cite{Choptuik:1992jv, Evans:1994pj, Niemeyer:1997mt}
\begin{equation}
m_\text{\tiny PBH} = \kappa \, m_\text{\tiny H} (\delta - \delta_c)^{\gamma_c},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = 3.3$ and $\gamma_c = 0.36$ in a radiation-dominated Universe \cite{Musco:2004ak,Musco:2008hv,Musco:2012au,Kalaja:2019uju,Escriva:2019nsa}.
Effectively, accounting for the statistical properties of curvature perturbations in the early Universe, the typical PBH mass is found to be around $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \simeq 0.7 m_\text{\tiny H}$ \cite{Germani:2018jgr,Biagetti:2021eep}.
Thus, introducing the horizon scaling with redshift in the standard cosmological scenario, one finds a characteristic formation redshift of $z_\text{\tiny f} \approx  2 \times 10^{17} \lp {m_\text{\tiny PBH}}/{10^{-12} M_\odot}\rp ^{-1/2}$ \cite{Sasaki:2018dmp}.
Finally, as the scale of inflation is bounded to be $H<6\times 10^{13}$ GeV by CMB observations \cite{Planck:2018jri}, the minimum PBH mass that can be formed in the early Universe is around $m_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny min} \simeq 10^{-33} M_\odot \approx 2 {\rm g}$.
 
It is interesting to notice that the same scalar perturbations generating PBHs are also responsible for the emission of GW at second order in perturbation theory \cite{Acquaviva:2002ud, Mollerach:2003nq, Ananda:2006af, Baumann:2007zm,Cai:2018dig,Bartolo:2018rku, Bartolo:2018evs,Unal:2018yaa,Bartolo:2019zvb,Wang:2019kaf,Cai:2019elf, DeLuca:2019ufz, Inomata:2019yww,Yuan:2019fwv,Pi:2020otn,Yuan:2020iwf,Romero-Rodriguez:2021aws,Balaji:2022rsy} (see Refs.~\cite{Yuan:2021qgz,Domenech:2021ztg} for reviews). 
As the horizon mass $m_\text{\tiny H}$ is related to the characteristic comoving frequency of perturbations by the relation \cite{Saito:2009jt}
\begin{equation}
f \simeq 5\, {\rm kHz} \lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny H}}{10^{-24} M_\odot}\rp ^{-1/2},
\end{equation}
one can immediately find that the formation of ultra-light PBHs may be associated with the emission of GW above the kHz frequency. 
Two comments, however, are in order at this point. 
Firstly, PBHs with masses below around $\lesssim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ evaporate within a timescale comparable to the age of the Universe due to the Hawking emission~\cite{Hawking:1976de, 1976PhRvD..13..198P}, and cannot account for a significant fraction of the dark matter.
This is because the evaporation timescale of a PBH with mass $m_\text{\tiny PBH}$ is 
\begin{equation} 
\tau_\text{\tiny PBH} = \frac{10240\,\pi}{N^\text{\tiny evap}_\text{\tiny eff}}\, \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}^3}{m_\text{\tiny Pl}^4}
\simeq 
10 \, {\rm Gyr } \lp \frac{N^\text{\tiny evap}_\text{\tiny eff}}{100}\rp^{-1}
\lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{3 \times 10^{-19} M_\odot}\rp^{3},
\label{tau-BH}
\end{equation}
where $m_\text{\tiny Pl} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ is the Planck mass and
$N^\text{\tiny evap}_\text{\tiny eff}$ is the number of particle species lighter than the BH temperature 
\begin{equation}
	T_\text{\tiny PBH}=\frac{m_\text{\tiny Pl}^2}{8\pi m_\text{\tiny PBH}} 
	\simeq 2 \times 10^{13}\, {\rm GHz} 
	\lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{3\times 10^{-19} M_\odot}\rp^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, it is clear that UHF experiments could only probe GWs emitted by the formation mechanism of PBHs with masses so small that would have already evaporated in the early Universe. 
%
Such light PBHs are also expected to emit gravitons through Hawking evaporation, producing a SGWB from the early Universe~\cite{Dolgov:2011cq}. 
However, PBHs that can survive until the late-time Universe are expected to emit a negligible fraction of their mass in the form of GWs and, therefore, are not able to generate a detectable GW signature through this mechanism. 
We will not discuss further details of such a potential GW signature in this draft and we will focus on GW emission from {\it relatively} heavier (and stable) PBHs in the mass range $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-18} M_\odot$. 
It suffices to say that the emission of GWs from either PBH formation or evaporation would necessarily take place at a very high redshift and the maximum amplitude of such a SGWB is required to fall below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis bound $\Omega_\text{\tiny GW} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Caprini:2018mtu}).



\subsection{Binary formation and merger rate}
\label{sec:MergerRate}

In the standard formation scenario, i.e. collapse in the radiation-dominated early Universe of Gaussian perturbations imprinted by the inflationary era, PBHs are expected to follow a Poisson spatial distribution at formation~\cite{Ali-Haimoud:2018dau,Desjacques:2018wuu,Ballesteros:2018swv,MoradinezhadDizgah:2019wjf,Inman:2019wvr}. 
We adopt this initial condition to derive the PBH merger rate, and present a discussion on the effect of initial clustering in Sec.~\ref{sec:clustering}.

PBH binaries decouple from the Hubble flow before matter-radiation equality if the distance $x$
separating two PBHs is smaller than the comoving distance~\cite{Nakamura:1997sm, Ioka:1998nz}
\begin{equation}
{x} = \lp \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{m_1+m_2}{a_\text{\tiny eq}^3\rho_\text{\tiny eq}} \rp^{1/3},
\end{equation}
written in terms of the scale factor $a_\text{\tiny eq}$ and energy density $\rho_\text{\tiny eq}$ at matter-radiation equality.
The initial PBH spatial distribution dictates both the probability of decoupling as well as the properties of the PBH binaries. In particular, accounting for the distribution of binaries' semi-major axis and eccentricity \cite{Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Kavanagh:2018ggo,Liu:2018ess,Franciolini:2021xbq}, which determines the time it takes for a binary to harden and merge under the emission of GWs, one can derive a formula for the merger rate at time $t$ as~(e.g. \cite{Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Raidal:2018bbj}) 
\begin{align}
\frac{\d^2 R_\text{\tiny PBH} }{\d m_1 \d m_2}= 
\frac{3.8  \times 10^{-2}}{\rm kpc^3 \, yr}
f_\text{\tiny PBH}^{\frac{53}{37}} \,
\lp \frac{t}{t_0} \rp^{-\frac{34}{37}}   
 \lp \frac{M_\text{\tiny tot}}{10^{-12}M_\odot} \rp^{-\frac{32}{37}}  
 \eta^{-\frac{34}{37}} 
S\lp M_\text{\tiny tot}, f_\text{\tiny PBH},\psi  \rp
\psi(m_1) \psi (m_2).
\label{PBHrate}
\end{align}
In Eq.~\eqref{PBHrate}, we introduced the current age of the Universe $t_0 = 13.8\,  {\rm Gyr}$, the
total mass of the binary $M_\text{\tiny tot}= m_1+m_2$, the symmetric mass ratio $\eta=m_1 m_2/M_\text{\tiny tot}^2$ and the PBH mass distribution $\psi (m)$ normalised such that $\int \d m \psi (m) = 1$.

We highlight the presence of the suppression factor $S\lp M_\text{\tiny tot}, f_\text{\tiny PBH},\psi  \rp \equiv S_1 \times S_2$
in Eq.~\eqref{PBHrate}, which corrects  the merger rate by 
introducing the effect of binary interactions with the surrounding environment in both the early- and late-time Universe. 
Specifically, the first contribution can be parameterized as~\cite{Hutsi:2020sol}
\begin{align}
	S_1 (M_\text{\tiny tot}, f_\text{\tiny PBH}, \psi)& \thickapprox 1.42 \llp \frac{\langle m^2 \rangle/\langle m\rangle^2}{\bar N +C} + \frac{\sigma ^2_\text{\tiny M}}{f^2_\text{\tiny PBH}}\rrp ^{-21/74} \exp \llp -  \bar N \rrp 
		\label{S1}
\end{align}
and reduces the PBH merger rate 
as a consequence of interactions close to the formation epoch between the forming binary and both the surrounding DM inhomogeneities with characteristic variance $\sigma_\text{\tiny M}^2 \simeq 3.6 \times 10^{-5}$
 as well as neighboring PBHs~\cite{Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Raidal:2018bbj,Liu:2018ess}, whose characteristic is
 \begin{equation}
\bar N \equiv \frac{M_\text{\tiny tot}}{\langle m \rangle } \frac{f_\text{\tiny PBH}}{f_\text{\tiny PBH}+ \sigma_\text{\tiny M}}.
\end{equation}
The explicit expression for the constant $C$ entering in Eq.~\eqref{S1} can be found in Ref.~\cite{Hutsi:2020sol}.
For a narrow mass function peaked at the mass scale $m_\text{\tiny PBH}$, the expectation values simplify to become $\langle m \rangle \simeq  \langle m^2 \rangle^{1/2} \simeq  m_\text{\tiny PBH}$, $M_\text{\tiny tot} \simeq 2 m_\text{\tiny PBH}$, and $S_1$ is independent of the PBH mass. 
The second term $S_2$ includes the effect of successive disruption of binaries that populate PBH clusters formed from the initial Poisson inhomogeneities~\cite{Vaskonen:2019jpv,Jedamzik:2020ypm,Young:2020scc,Jedamzik:2020omx,DeLuca:2020jug,Trashorras:2020mwn,Tkachev:2020uin,Hutsi:2020sol}.
This is conservatively estimated assuming that the entire fraction of binaries included in dense environments is disrupted and reads \cite{Hutsi:2020sol}
\begin{align}\label{eq:supS2}
	S_2 (x) & \thickapprox 
	\text{min} 
	\llp 1\, ,\, 9.6 \times 10^{-3} x ^{-0.65} \exp \lp 0.03 \ln^2 x \rp  \rrp ,
\end{align}
with $x \equiv (t(z)/t_0)^{0.44} f_\text{\tiny PBH}$. 
Recent numerical results on PBH clustering confirm the suppression factor we adopt in this work, 
provided one correctly accounts for the fraction of PBH binaries surviving outside dense PBH clusters~\cite{link}.
The suppression due to disruption in PBH sub-structures $S_2$ is at most ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ for large $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$, 
while it becomes negligible for small enough values of PBH abundance, i.e. $f_\text{\tiny PBH} \lesssim 0.003$.
This estimate is compatible with the cosmological N-body simulations of Ref.~\cite{Inman:2019wvr}, where it was found that PBHs remain effectively isolated for sufficiently small $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$.


\subsubsection{The role of late-time Universe dynamical capture for light PBHs}
We remark that other PBH binary formation mechanisms, taking place in the late-time Universe, may exist. 
For example, an alternative channel assumes PBH binary formation is induced by GW capture \cite{1989ApJ...343..725Q,Mouri:2002mc} in the present age dense DM environments. 
For initially Poisson distributed PBHs, the merger rate of binaries produced in the late-time Universe is subdominant with respect to the early Universe ones discussed above. 
This was explicitly shown for PBH binaries of masses around $m_\text{\tiny PBH}\simeq 30 M_\odot$~\cite{Ali-Haimoud:2017rtz,Raidal:2017mfl,Korol:2019jud,Vaskonen:2019jpv,DeLuca:2020jug,link}. 


Let us offer here a back-of-the-envelope computation showing why this conclusion would be even stronger for lighter PBHs. 
The cross-section for PBH capture, assuming equal mass objects, is 
$\Gamma_\text{\tiny cap} \simeq 44 \, m_\text{\tiny PBH}^2  v_\text{\tiny rel}^{{-11/7}}$ \cite{1989ApJ...343..725Q,Mouri:2002mc}, 
while the binary formation rate in a PBH cluster takes the form $R_\text{\tiny env} \simeq r^3_\text{\tiny cl} n_\text{\tiny cl}^2 \langle  \Gamma_\text{\tiny cap} v_\text{\tiny rel}\rangle$. 
In the previous equations, we introduced the PBH characteristic relative velocity $v_\text{\tiny rel}$, the PBH cluster size $r_\text{\tiny cl}$ and local PBH number density $n_\text{\tiny cl}$ in the PBH cluster.
The merger rate of binaries produced by this channel is mostly dominated by small clusters, characterized by smaller virial velocities, that are able to survive dynamical evaporation until low redshift. 
The small scale structure, in a PBH DM scenario, is expected to be induced by the PBH initial Poisson noise (see, for example, Ref.~\cite{DeLuca:2020jug} for a more thorough discussion on PBH clustering evolution and Ref.~\cite{Inman:2019wvr} for a cosmological N-body simulation involving solar mass PBHs). Assuming the number density of such environments scales proportionally to the PBH number density, as is the case in the Press-Schechter theory \cite{1974ApJ...187..425P}, one finds that the PBH binary merger rate from PBH capture scales as
\begin{equation}
R_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny cap} \sim m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{-11/21}.
\end{equation}
This derivation also assumes the collapsed PBH clusters are characterized by a density roughly $200$ times the mean density in the Universe at cluster formation (which does not depend on PBH masses), the size of clusters scales like $r_\text{\tiny cl} \sim  (M_\text{\tiny cl} / \rho_\text{\tiny cl})^{1/3}\sim m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{1/3}$ and the virial velocity (i.e. approximately the characteristic PBH relative velocity) is $v_\text{\tiny rel} \sim (M_\text{\tiny cl}/r_\text{\tiny cl})^{1/2} \sim m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{1/3}$.
Therefore, taking the ratio between the merger rate for early-  and late-time Universe PBH binaries, that is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{R_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny cap} }{R_\text{\tiny PBH}}  \sim m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{265/777},
\end{equation}
one concludes  that capture is increasingly less relevant for light PBHs and can be safely neglected, at least in the standard PBH formation scenario discussed in this section. 


\subsubsection{The role of disruptions in PBH clusters for light PBHs}
In the previous derivation of the merger rate, we included the suppression factor due to interactions with neighboring PBHs in clusters.\footnote{
The estimate of $S_2$ does not account for potential interactions with  astrophysical objects in the late-time Universe  (such as stars and astrophysically formed BHs). 
However, this phenomenon is not expected to significantly affect the PBH merger rate as the astrophysical environments are characterized by smaller densities and a larger velocity dispersion when compared to PBH small-scale clusters, reducing the probability of PBH binary disruption.} 
Let us show here that scaling the result in Eq.~\eqref{eq:supS2} obtained in the solar mass range to smaller masses leads to a consistent estimate for the merger rate at the present epoch. 
Indeed, one can show that the characteristic interaction time-scale $t_\text{\tiny p}$ in PBH clusters is only weakly dependent on the PBH mass.
In particular, we can define~\cite{Vaskonen:2019jpv}
\begin{equation}
	1/t_\text{\tiny p}  = n_\text{\tiny cl} \langle \sigma_\text{\tiny p} v_\text{\tiny rel}\rangle
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\text{\tiny p}$ is the cross-section for scattering events that are able to increase the angular momentum of the binary by an amount comparable to its initial value. 
As the merger timescale is given by $\tau \simeq 3 a^4 j^7 / 170 m_\text{\tiny PBH}^3$ \cite{Peters:1963ux,Peters:1964zz}, where the angular momentum is defined as $j\simeq \sqrt{1-e^2}$ in terms of the binary eccentricity $e$
and $a$ is the semi-major axis, such interactions may enhance merger time-delays, reducing the fraction of binaries that are able to merge within the age of the Universe.  
The disruptive interaction cross-section is $\sigma_\text{\tiny p} \approx 28 m^{7/4} \tau^{1/4}/v_\text{\tiny rel}^2 j^{29/12}$, and therefore one obtains
\begin{equation}
	t_\text{\tiny p} \sim  m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{-10/111},
\end{equation}
which is only weakly dependent on PBH masses.
Additionally, the time-scale for dynamical relaxation potentially bringing PBH binaries in the cluster centers and enhancing PBH interactions is independent of the PBH mass \cite{binn,Vaskonen:2019jpv,DeLuca:2020jug}.
Based upon these considerations, we conclude that one can safely extrapolate the suppression factor computed for solar-mass PBH binaries to lower masses.

In order to bracket uncertainties on potentially modified PBH initial conditions, 
in the next section we are going to present an estimate for the maximum merger rate potentially attained in initially clustered PBH scenarios, where the binary formation rate is boosted. 
This will serve as an upper bound for the PBH merger rate used in the following sections. 


\subsubsection{The effect of accretion on the PBH merger rate}
PBH binaries may experience efficient phases of accretion impacting individual masses, spins and the binary's orbital geometry \cite{DeLuca:2020bjf,DeLuca:2020fpg,DeLuca:2020qqa}. 
In this subsection, we provide an estimate showing why this potential effect is not expected to modify the merger rate of light PBHs. 

Due to the long characteristic time-scale for the accretion process compared to the characteristic binary period, one can assume that PBH masses vary adiabatically. 
Therefore, one can compute the modification of semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$ assuming 
the adiabatic invariants for the Keplerian two-body problem $I_\phi$ and $I_r $ are kept fixed, i.e.~\cite{landau1976mechanics}
\begin{align}
	I_\phi &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} p_\phi \d \phi = L_z \simeq \text{const.}  \\
	I_r &=  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{r_{\rm min}}^{r_{\rm max}} p_r \d r  = - L_z + \sqrt{M_\text{\tiny tot} \mu^2 a} \simeq \text{const.},
\end{align}
where we introduced the notation for the reduced mass $\mu = \eta M_\text{\tiny tot}$.
One obtains that the eccentricity $e$ is an adiabatic invariant while the semi-major axis evolves following
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dot a}{a} + 3\frac{\dot m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{m_\text{\tiny PBH}} =0\,,
\end{equation}
assuming equal mass binaries with $m_1 \simeq m_2 \simeq m_\text{\tiny PBH}$. 
This shows that mass accretion shrinks binary orbits. 
Including this effect in the computation of the merger rate, Eq.~\eqref{PBHrate}, leads to an enhancement factor scaling as  \cite{DeLuca:2020qqa}
\begin{equation}\label{rateaccretionPBHbin}
R_\text{\tiny PBH} \propto
\lp 1 + \int \d t \frac{\dot m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{m_\text{\tiny PBH}} \rp^{9/37} 
\exp\llp \frac{36}{37} \int \d t \frac{\dot m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}
\rrp.
\end{equation}
At this point, the crucial ingredient is the efficiency of accretion for light PBHs. 
We are going to assume that the impact of secondary DM halos accumulating around PBHs (e.g. \cite{Ricotti:2007au,Ricotti:2007jk,Adamek:2019gns,DeLuca:2020qqa}) is small, 
which is inevitably the case when PBHs are a dominant component of the DM.\footnote{We note that much larger accretion rates may be obtained when the secondary DM halo becomes relevant. 
This has important consequences for PBH binary properties, and in particular the spin distribution when $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \gtrsim M_\odot$ \cite{DeLuca:2020bjf,Franciolini:2021xbq,Franciolini:2022iaa} and comparison with constraints on the PBH abundance \cite{DeLuca:2020fpg,DeLuca:2020sae}.
We do not expect, however, this effect to be able to qualitatively change the results of this section as far as light (i.e. sub-solar) PBHs are concerned.
}
One can compute the accretion rate in a cosmological setting starting from high redshift (soon after binary formation epoch) using the Bondi-Hoyle formula.
As shown in Ref.~\cite{DeLuca:2020qqa}, the relevant effective velocity is modulated by the orbital evolution while the baryonic gas density $\rho$ is enhanced by the binary attracting matter on its center of mass. One finds that 
\begin{align}
\dot m_{\text{\tiny PBH},1} = \dot M_\text{\tiny bin}  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 (1+q)}}, 
	\qquad
\dot m_{\text{\tiny PBH},2} = \dot M_\text{\tiny bin}  \frac{\sqrt{q} }{\sqrt{2 (1+q)}}, 
\label{M1M2dotFIN}
\end{align}
which simplifies to $\dot m_{\text{\tiny PBH},1,2} 
\sim \dot M_\text{\tiny bin}/2 $ 
for equal mass binaries, where the binary gas accretion rate is
%%%
\begin{equation} \label{R1bin}
\dot M_\text{\tiny bin} = 4 \pi \lambda \rho_\text{\tiny gas} v^{-3}_\text{\tiny eff} M^2_\text{\tiny tot}\,,
\end{equation}
in terms of the effective velocity $v_\text{\tiny eff}$ and the accretion eigenvalue $\lambda$ (see Ref.~\cite{Ricotti:2007au} for more details).
Without the effect of a DM halo, this rate was estimated in Ref.~\cite{Ali-Haimoud:2016mbv} to be
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dot M_\text{\tiny bin}}{\dot M_\text{\tiny Edd}} \sim 10^{-5} \lp \frac{M_\text{\tiny tot}}{M_{\odot}}\rp,
\end{equation}
when normalised to the Eddington rate $\dot{M}_\text{\tiny Edd} \equiv L_\text{\tiny Edd} \approx 2 m_\text{\tiny PBH} / \text{Gyr}$ and for redshift below $z\simeq 10^2$, where the mass accretion integrals in Eq.~\eqref{rateaccretionPBHbin} are dominated.
Therefore, even conservatively assuming a prolonged accretion phase lasting until well within the reionization and structure formation epochs, one finds that
\begin{equation}
\int dt \frac{\dot{m}_\text{\tiny PBH}}{{m}_\text{\tiny PBH}} \sim 3 \times 10^{-4}  \lp \frac{{m}_\text{\tiny PBH}}{M_{\odot}} \rp,	
\end{equation}
showing accretion on light PBH binaries is irrelevant and cannot affect the merger rate through the corrections shown in Eq.~\eqref{rateaccretionPBHbin}. 


\subsubsection{Maximum theoretical merger rate}\label{sec:clustering}

The description of the merger rate in the previous section is based 
on the standard scenario of PBH formation where binaries are assembled from an initially Poisson distributed population of PBHs. 
In this section we explore whether changing this initial condition may give rise to larger PBH merger rates. 


It is known that local non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations can modify the initial distribution of PBHs and make them clustered directly at the formation time \cite{Tada:2015noa,Young:2015kda,Young:2019gfc,Atal:2020igj,DeLuca:2021hcf}.\footnote{The clustering of PBHs with masses $\gtrsim M_\odot$ could be significantly constrained in the future through CMB distortion observations, probing the scales corresponding to the average PBH distance at formation \cite{DeLuca:2021hcf}. 
However, the clustering scales corresponding to lighter PBHs considered in this work are much smaller and not observable with this technique.} 
%
In this scenario, since the PBHs are closer to each other on average, the binary formation rate is enhanced due to a larger probability of decoupling from the Hubble flow. 
However, it is fair to say that little is known about the cosmological evolution of binaries in PBH halos produced in such a clustered scenario. On the one hand, the presence of dense PBH halos would likely enhance the rate of binary-PBH gravitational interaction, leading to binary disruptions and an effective suppression of the merger rate at late time. On the other hand, dense PBH clusters tend to evaporate due to the gravitational relaxation process \cite{binn,DeLuca:2020jug}, limiting the potential extent of this suppression. These dynamical processes are still poorly modeled for clustered scenarios and, therefore, we will purposely neglect potential suppression factors and adopt this as the maximum theoretical PBH merger rate. 
We will also neglect the contribution to the merger rate from disrupted binaries which are still merging within the age of the Universe and may potentially become relevant for large $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$ \cite{Vaskonen:2019jpv}. 

Clustered PBH scenarios may also boost the merger rate of binaries dynamically formed in the late-time Universe (e.g. through capture \cite{1989ApJ...343..725Q,Mouri:2002mc} or three-body interactions \cite{Ivanova:2005mi,2010ApJ...717..948I,Rodriguez:2021qhl,Kritos:2020wcl}).\footnote{We note that hyperbolic encounters \cite{Garcia-Bellido:2017knh,Garcia-Bellido:2021jlq,Morras:2021atg} give rise to very fast burst of GW radiation, which may be hard to detect with UHF GW experiments. Additionally, they give a small contribution to the SGWB compared to binary PBHs \cite{Garcia-Bellido:2021jlq}. We will therefore neglect this GW source in our considerations. }
This holds, however, provided PBH clusters are able to survive dynamical relaxation until late times \cite{binn}.
Since a proper assessment of the merger rate in such scenarios is still lacking in the literature, 
we neglect such effect and only discuss the maximum theoretical merger rate attainable from early Universe binary formation from clustered PBHs~\cite{Raidal:2017mfl}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/maxrate.pdf}
\caption{
Ratio between the maximum attainable merger rate in clustered scenarios and the merger rate in the standard PBH formation scenario. The ratio scales non-linearly with $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$ and grows again as $\propto 1/f_\text{\tiny PBH}$ for small enough values of the abundance. 
%
}\label{fig: max rate}
\end{figure}

Following the notation introduced in Ref.~\cite{Raidal:2017mfl},
we define the local PBH overdensity in the early Universe  $\delta_\text{\tiny dc}$ in terms of the PBH correlation function $\xi_\text{\tiny  PBH}$ at formation, assuming it is constant up to the binary scale $\tilde{x}$ at the decoupling epoch~\cite{Tada:2015noa, Raidal:2017mfl, Suyama:2019cst, Atal:2020yic, DeLuca:2021hcf}, that is $\delta_\text{\tiny dc} \approx 1 + \xi_\text{\tiny  PBH}  (x)$ when $x < \tilde{x}$.
In the limit in which the local fraction of PBHs is large,
 i.e. $\delta_\text{\tiny dc} f_\text{\tiny PBH} \gg 1$, the merger rate in the clustered scenario can be written as \cite{DeLuca:2021hde}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PBHrateclu}
R^\text{\tiny max}_\text{\tiny PBH}
	&\simeq 
	\frac{57}{{\rm kpc}^3 {\rm yr}}
	\,
	 f_\text{\tiny PBH} 	\lp \frac{t}{t_0}\rp^{-1}  \lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} M_\odot}\rp^{-1}  \lp 1 + 1.7 \times 10^{-4} \Delta_\text{\tiny dc} \rp \exp\llp- 9.5 \times 10^{-5} \Delta_\text{\tiny dc}\rrp,
\end{align}
where we defined 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:critdc}
\Delta_\text{\tiny dc} =  
6 \times 10^{-5}\,
\delta_\text{\tiny dc} f_\text{\tiny PBH} 	\lp \frac{t}{t_0}\rp^{3/16}  \lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} M_\odot}\rp^{5/16}.
\end{equation}
In Fig.~\ref{fig: max rate} we plot the ratio between the maximum attainable merger rate in clustered scenario and the merger rate in the standard PBH formation scenario. 
One finds that the rate can never be enhanced by more than six orders of magnitude in the mass range of our interest.
As we will see in the following, this extreme scenario would correspond to a reduction of the average distance of a
PBH merger from us in one year of observations of {\it at most} two orders of magnitude.

In the extreme scenarios where the PBH merger rate is drastically enhanced by some clustering mechanism, 
the rate of conversion of PBH binaries to freely propagating GWs would be high and could possibly be constrained from dark matter to dark radiation conversion bounds (see e.g. \cite{DES:2020mpv}).
We leave a proper study of this possibility to future work. 
On the other hand, even though $\Omega_\text{\tiny GW}$ could  become larger than around $\approx 10^{-5}$, the BBN bound would not apply, as most of the GW energy density 
would only be produced at late times. 



\subsection{Impact of local DM enhancement}
\label{sec:DMenhancement}

For sources that are closer to the Earth than ${\cal O}(100)$ kpc, a correction due to the local DM overdensity needs to be taken into account. 
Following Ref.~\cite{Pujolas:2021yaw}, we model the Milky Way DM halo 
as a Navarro-Frenk-White density profile~\cite{Navarro:1995iw,Navarro:1996gj},
\begin{equation}
	\rho_\text{\tiny{DM}}(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_0} \left(1+\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{\!2}} \,.
\end{equation}
We fix the reference energy density $\rho_0$ 
such that the local DM density is 
$\rho_\text{\tiny DM}(r=r_\odot) = 7.9\times 10^{-3}M_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$~\cite{Cautun:2019eaf}, 
while the reference scale is $r_0 = 15.6\, { kpc}$ and the solar system location is $r_\odot \simeq  8.0\,{ kpc}$. 
As we will compute the number density of sources within a volume centered at the solar system location, the average overdensity within a volume of radius $r$ around $\hat r \simeq  r_\odot$ can be estimated by
effectively cutting the density profile at $r_\odot$
\begin{align}
	\rho(r-\hat r)=
\begin{cases}
		\rho_\text{\tiny DM}(r_\odot)   &,   \quad   r-\hat r < r_\odot,	
\\
		\rho_\text{\tiny DM}( r-\hat r)         &,   \quad   r-\hat r \gtrsim  r_\odot,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
see Ref.~\cite{Pujolas:2021yaw} for more details.
\textcolor{black}{As the volume average of the dark matter overdensity around an observer located on the earth when $r \ll r_\odot$ is dominated by the value 
of the local density $\rho_\text{\tiny DM}(r_\odot)$, it follows that our estimates are not much sensitive to deviations from the NFW profile at small scales towards the galactic center (e.g. cored DM profiles). }
As we expect the distribution of binaries to follow the large/galactic scales, 
the local DM overdensity enhances the merger rate in Eq.~\eqref{PBHrate} by an overall factor of 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Rlocal}
	R_\text{\tiny PBH} ^\text{\tiny local} (r) = \delta (r) R_\text{\tiny PBH} \,,
\end{equation}
where we defined the overdensity factor $\delta(r) \equiv \rho_\text{\tiny DM}(r)/\bar \rho_\text{\tiny DM}$. 
Therefore, one finds that this correction falls within the range
$
	\delta(r) \subset(1 \div 2 \times 10^5) \,	
$.

Accounting for this local enhancement factor, we compute the volume $V_\text{\tiny yr}$, 
or equivalently the distance $d_\text{\tiny yr}  \equiv  \lp 3 V_\text{\tiny yr}/ 4 \pi  \rp ^{1/3}$, 
enclosing the region where one expects at least one merger per year, on average. 
We will neglect the effect of cosmological redshift as it is irrelevant for the small distances with which we are concerned.
We define the number of events per year $N_\text{\tiny yr}$ within the volume $V_\text{\tiny yr}$ as 
\begin{equation}
N_\text{\tiny yr} \equiv 
\Delta t \int^{d_\text{\tiny yr}}_0 \d r 4 \pi r^2 R^\text{\tiny local}_\text{\tiny PBH}(r)
\,,
\end{equation}
where we set $\Delta t = 1\,{\rm yr}$.
In Fig.~\ref{fig: dist}, we show the distance $d_\text{\tiny yr}$ as a function of PBH masses and abundance for $N_\text{\tiny yr} = 1$ and assuming a narrow PBH mass distribution. It is interesting to notice that when the characteristic merger distance becomes larger than ${\cal O}(10)$ kpc, the galactic overdensity decreases significantly and $d_\text{\tiny yr}$ changes slope, leading to steeper dependence on PBH mass. Once $\delta(r) \sim {\cal O}(1) $, the slope goes back to the one expected from the volume factor and a constant merger rate per unit volume.

\subsection{Gravitational wave strain and signal duration}
\label{sec:SignalDuration}


As we will see in the following, two crucial properties of PBH mergers affect the binary detectability.
These are the characteristic GW strain and the GW signal duration. 
The leading-order GW signal from a BH inspiral for the two polarizations $h_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}$ in the stationary phase approximation (assuming that the frequency varies slowly) can be written as \cite{Maggiore:1900zz}
\begin{equation}
h_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(t) = h_0 \, F_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(\theta) \, G_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(t) \,,
\end{equation}
where $F_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(\theta)$ is a function that depends on the binary orientation angle $\theta$, $G_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(t)$ corresponds to the binary oscillation phase, and
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GWamplitude}
h_0 &= 
\frac{4}{d_L} 
\left(G m_c \right)^{5/3} 
\left(\pi f \right)^{2/3} 
\nonumber \\
&\simeq 9.77 \times 10^{-34} \left(\frac{f}{1 \, \text{GHz}}\right)^{2/3} \left(\frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} \, M_\odot}\right)^{5/3} \left(\frac{d_L}{1 \, \text{kpc}}\right)^{-1} \,,
\end{align}
where $m_c = {(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}/{(m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}}$ is the chirp mass for two BHs with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ (in the last step we have used $m_1 = m_2 = m_\text{\tiny PBH}$), 
and $d_\text{\tiny L}$ is the distance from the observer.
Adopting the stationary phase approximation, the GW signal in Fourier space is~\cite{Sathyaprakash:2009xs}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spawaveform}
\tilde{h}_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(f) = {\mathcal A}_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}} e^{i \Psi_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(f)}, 
\end{equation}
where the explicit expressions for $\Psi_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}(f)$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\scriptscriptstyle{+,\times}}$ are given e.g. in~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}. 
Assuming equal mass binaries, the characteristic strain $h_c (f)\equiv 2 f | \tilde h(f) | $ is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spawaveform2}
|h_c (f) | \simeq 4.54 \times 10^{-28} \lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} M_\odot }\rp^{5/6} \lp \frac{d_\text{\tiny L}}{\rm kpc} \rp^{-1} \lp \frac{f}{\rm GHz}\rp ^{-1/6} \,,
\end{equation}
where we have used that ignoring the angular dependence one has $|\tilde{h}(f)| \approx |\tilde{h}_{\scriptscriptstyle{+}}(f)| \approx |\tilde{h}_{\scriptscriptstyle{\times}}(f)|$.
This modeling of the GW signal only includes the inspiral phase of the binary up to the ISCO frequency in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fISCO}, before the objects plunge, merge and the ringdown signal is emitted by the remnant BH reaching its stationary configuration. 
This is, however, sufficient for our purposes as only the GW signal produced during the inspiral phase can last for a sufficiently long time to allow for potential detection (see more details in Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors}). 
We also observe from Fig.~\ref{fig: dist} that for binaries at the edge of the galactic DM enhancement (e.g. $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-6} M_\odot$ and high $f_\text{\tiny PBH} $), the characteristic distance grows roughly as $d_\text{\tiny yr}\propto m_\text{\tiny PBH}$. On the other hand, the characteristic strain scales as $h_c \propto m_\text{\tiny PBH}^{5/6}$. 
This means that one expects a similar strain from characteristic inspiraling sources within such a mass range, unless $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$.


An important property of inspiraling sources is the GW signal duration. If we consider an equal mass PBH binary with $m_1 = m_2 = m_\text{\tiny PBH}$, the coalescence time can be written as~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CoalescenceTime}
\tau(f) \approx 83 \, {\rm{sec}} \, \left(\frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} M_\odot}\right)^{-5/3} \left(\frac{f}{\rm{GHz}}\right)^{-8/3} \,.
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}, one can find the time spent by the inspiral phase to span a given frequency interval.
This quantity will be crucial when computing the detector sensitivities in Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors}.
In Fig.~\ref{fig: dist}, we show the time it takes for an equal-mass binary to span at least half a decade of frequencies. 
We warn the reader, however, that the time spent spanning a very narrow resonant frequency band could be much smaller than what is estimated in Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}. We will discuss this in detail in the next section.



\subsubsection{GW amplitude vs characteristic strain}

The variation of the GW frequency plays a crucial role in the definition of the characteristic strain for coherent GW signals. Let us consider for instance  two BHs in the inspiral phase: as they emit GWs, they get closer and closer to each other and eventually merge. As they are approaching, the GW frequency, which is twice the orbital frequency, grows. The number of cycles that the binary spends at a given frequency $f$ is determined by~\cite{Moore:2014lga},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ncycles}
N_\text{\tiny cycles} = \frac{f^2}{\dot{f}} \simeq 2.16 \times 10^6 \, \left(\frac{f}{10^9 \, \text{Hz}}\right)^{-5/3} \left(\frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-9} \, M_\odot}\right)^{-5/3} \,.
\end{equation}
$N_\text{\tiny cycles}$ is an important quantity because it determines whether the signal can be considered to be approximately monochromatic, if $N_\text{\tiny cycles} \gg 1$. 
In the stationary phase approximation, a GW signal with an approximately constant amplitude $h_0$ as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWamplitude} produces a characteristic strain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:StrainInspirals}
h_c(f) = \sqrt{\frac{2 f^2}{\dot{f}}} h_0 \,,
\end{equation}
where $\dot{f}$ can be explicitly written as~\cite{Maggiore:1900zz}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dotf}
\dot{f} = \frac{96}{5} \pi^{8/3} m_c^{5/3} f^{11/3} \simeq 4.62 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Hz}^2 \left(\frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-9} M_\odot}\right)^{5/3} \left(\frac{f}{\text{GHz}}\right)^{11/3}\,,
\end{equation}
and  we considered two equal mass PBHs $m_1 = m_2 = m_\text{\tiny PBH}$.
Note that only close to the ISCO frequency, 
namely at the final phase of the merger, 
the prefactor $f^2/\dot{f} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, and then $h_c (f)$ is of the same order of magnitude as the GW amplitude $h_0$.\\

When comparing a GW signal with a detector sensitivity curve, one has to compare the observation time $t_\text{\tiny obs}$ with the characteristic time of variation of the frequency $t_\text{\tiny f} = f/\dot{f}$. If $t_\text{\tiny obs} \ll t_\text{\tiny f}$, the observation time sets an upper bound on $N_\text{\tiny cycles}^{\text{\tiny obs}} < N_\text{\tiny cycles}$ and the characteristic strain is mainly determined by $h_0$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:StrainMonochromatic}
h_c(f) \simeq \sqrt{N_\text{\tiny cycles}^{\text{\tiny obs}}} \, h_0 \,, \quad \text{for} \quad t_\text{\tiny obs} \ll t_\text{\tiny f} \,.
\end{equation}
In the opposite limit, when $t_\text{\tiny obs} \gg t_\text{\tiny f}$, then one can observe the signal for its entire duration and the characteristic strain is enhanced by a factor $\sqrt{N_\text{\tiny cycles}}$ with respect to the GW amplitude
\begin{equation}
h_c(f) \simeq \sqrt{N_\text{\tiny cycles}} \, h_0 \,, \quad \text{for} \quad t_\text{\tiny obs} \gg t_\text{\tiny f} \,.
\end{equation}
Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:StrainMonochromatic} is also  valid for strictly monochromatic sources, for which the prefactor $f^2/\dot{f}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:StrainInspirals} is not well-defined and the condition $t_\text{\tiny obs} \ll t_\text{\tiny f}$ is always satisfied.\\

In other words, for a coherent GW signal, $h_c(f)$ represents the maximum signal that can be observed at a given frequency, as it takes into account the maximum enhancement due to the intrinsic number of cycles spent by the binary at that frequency. If the observation time is smaller than the characteristic time of variation of the GW frequency, then the GW signal is suppressed by a factor $(N_\text{\tiny cycles}^\text{\tiny obs}/N_\text{\tiny cycles})^{1/2}$ with respect to $h_c$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single} we plot the detector sensitivity curves against the characteristic strain $h_c$, which is an upper bound on the observable signal,
for a binary located at a distance $d_\text{\tiny yr}$ under various assumptions on $m_\text{\tiny PBH}$ and $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$.\footnote{Note that in Figs.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single},~\ref{fig: PBH hc SGWB} and \ref{fig: PBH hc supperradiance} we report the detectors as displayed in~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq}, with the addition of some recent proposals~\cite{Berlin:2021txa, Domcke:2022rgu, Berlin:2022hfx}. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors}, we will discuss in details the various detectors as well as the detection prospects.} 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors} we will discuss explicitly which quantity should be compared with the sensitivity curves of each detector.
For comparison, we also summarise the sensitivities of GW experiments, see Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors} for more details. 
It is important to stress at this stage that even though various experiments may be able to reach strain sensitivities comparable to the one expected from light PBH binaries, due to the short duration of the signal individual binary emission may still deceive detection.
We will discuss this point in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors}.
One promising attempt to evade this problem is to focus on the SGWB produced by unresolved mergers building up across the evolution of the Universe. 
This signal is stationary and not limited in time duration. 
As we will see in the next section, however, there is a trade-off to be paid,  as such a signal it is typically associated with a smaller characteristic strain, being dominated by sources at much further distances from the earth.  


\subsection{Stochastic gravitational wave background}
\label{sec:SGWB}

Unresolved PBH mergers also contribute to a SGWB, whose spectrum at frequency $\nu$ can be computed as
\begin{equation}\label{stocOmega}
\Omega_\text{\tiny GW} (\nu)= 
 \frac{\nu}{\rho_0} 
 \iint \d m_1 \d m_2 
  \int_0^{{\nu_\text{\tiny cut}}/{\nu}-1}
  \frac{ \d z }{(1+z)H(z)} 
  \frac{\d R_\text{\tiny PBH} }{\d m_1 \d m_2} 
   \frac{\d E_\text{\tiny GW} (\nu_s)}{\d \nu_s},
\end{equation}
in terms of the redshifted source frequency $\nu_s =\nu (1+z)$, the present energy density $\rho_0 = 3 H_0^2/8\pi$ in terms of the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the energy spectrum of GWs. 
In this expression, the redshift upper integration limit corresponds to the
maximum $z$ up to which the energy spectrum can contribute to the given frequency of $\Omega_\text{\tiny GW}(\nu)$ 
while $\nu_\text{\tiny cut}$ is the maximum frequency of the GW emitted by  the binary. 
To compute the integral over the distribution of masses, we assume a log-normal PBH mass distribution 
\begin{equation}\label{lognormal mass function}
    \psi(m | M_c, \sigma ) = 
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma  m}
    \exp 
    \llp 
    -\frac{\log ^2 (m/M_c)}{2 \sigma^2} 
    \rrp,
\end{equation}
characterised by a central mass scale $M_c$ (not to be confused with the chirp mass $m_c$ above) and a given width $\sigma$.
This model-independent parametrization of the mass function can describe
a population arising from a symmetric peak in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in a wide variety of formation models (see e.g. Refs.~\cite{Dolgov:1992pu,Carr:2017jsz}) and is often used in the literature to
set constraints on the PBH abundance from GW measurements 
\cite{Garcia-Bellido:2017fdg,Raidal:2018bbj,DeLuca:2020sae,Wong:2020yig,Gow:2019pok,Hall:2020daa,Hutsi:2020sol,DeLuca:2021wjr,Franciolini:2021tla}. 



We describe the GW energy spectrum emitted by coalescing binary BHs using the phenomenological model presented in Ref.~\cite{Ajith:2009bn}. 
The GW emission can be divided into three distinct parts, corresponding to the inspiral, merger and ringdown, respectively. 
Each stage is related to a different frequency range $\nu$, which depends on the binary BH component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and non-precessing spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$. 
Assuming circular orbits, one can write \cite{Zhu:2011bd}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}\nu} = \frac{(G \pi)^{2/3} \mathcal{M}^{5/3}}{3} 
    \begin{cases}
     \nu^{-1/3} f_1^2  & \nu < \nu_\text{\tiny merger},
     \\
     \omega_1 \nu^{2/3} f_2^2 & \nu_\text{\tiny merger} \leq \nu < \nu_\text{\tiny ringdown},
      \\
     \omega_2 f_3^2 & \nu_\text{\tiny ringdown} \leq \nu < \nu_\text{\tiny cut}. 
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:dEdnu}
\end{equation}
We report in Appendix~\ref{app_GW_energy} the exact expressions for the factors entering in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dEdnu}.

Translating the SGWB abundance computed in Eq.~\eqref{stocOmega} in terms of a characteristic strain, we find\footnote{
Our definition of characteristic strain $h_c$ follows Eq.~(4b) of Ref.~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq}.
Notice a difference of a factor $\sqrt{2}$ in the definition of $h_c$ compared to \cite{Ringwald:2020ist} (see their Eq.~(2.28)). }
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:StochasticStrain}
	h_c(f) \approx \left[ \frac{3}{4 \pi^2 } \left ( \frac{H_0^2}{f^2}\right) \Omega_\text{\tiny GW} (f) \right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where the current Hubble rate is $H_0 = 2.18 \times 10^{-18}\,$Hz. Therefore, the characteristic strain can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{strain SGWB}
h_c \approx 2 \times 10^{-31} \left ( \frac{f}{{\rm GHz}} \right)^{-1} \left ( \frac{\Omega_\text{\tiny GW} }{10^{-7}} \right)^{1/2} .
\end{equation}
The tail at low-frequency of a SGWB produced by inspiraling binaries is characterized by a scaling $\Omega_\text{\tiny GW}(f) \sim f^{2/3}$ \cite{Moore:2014lga}. This corresponds to a characteristic strain scaling as $h_c (f) \sim f^{-2/3}$. Note that in the case of a SGWB we do not have the same issues that we addressed in Sec.~\ref{sec:SignalDuration} for individual inspiral sources: the characteristic strain is uniquely determined by the energy density in GWs. Furthermore, a SGWB signal is stationary, implying that there is no issue related to the duration of the signal.

\begin{figure}[t!]

We warn the reader that some of the sensitivities reported in this plot were not derived assuming a SGWB signal, and may degrade w.r.t. what is shown in the plot.
Also, the actual performance of sub-kHz detectors at observing a SGWB is typically described in terms of "power-law integrated" sensitivity curves, see for example App. C of Ref.~\cite{Bavera:2021wmw}.
We do not discuss sub-kHz detections with such details but we refer the interested reader to Refs.~\cite{DeLuca:2021hde,Pujolas:2021yaw}. 
}\label{fig: PBH hc SGWB}
\end{figure}



In Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc SGWB} we show the spectrum of characteristic SGWB strain produced by a narrow PBH population (whose mass distribution is described by Eq.~\eqref{lognormal mass function}) for various values of $f_\text{\tiny PBH}$. 
In order to set an upper bound to such a contribution, we also show the result assuming the maximum merger rate {\it potentially} obtained in clustered scenarios $R_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny max}$.
It is interesting to notice that the SGWB tail at low frequencies is expected to possess a natural cut-off due to the minimum (red-shifted) frequency emitted by the binaries at the formation epoch. 
We do not model such a drop of the signal as it would fall, in any case, below the sensitivity reach of sub-kHz interferometric GW detectors such as ET and LISA. 


As we indicate with thin black dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc SGWB}, unless the maximum rate is achieved and one considers masses above $M_c\gtrsim 10^{-8} M_\odot$, 
the low-frequency tail of the signal would be, in any case, too faint to be visible by sub-kHz GW interferometers such as ET and LISA at lower frequencies. This result was already pointed out in 
Ref.~\cite{DeLuca:2021hde},  see their Fig.~4 and related discussion.
This confirms the necessity of UHF experiments to search and constrain the SGWB of light PBH mergers. 





\subsection{Gravitational wave memory}
\label{sec:Memory}

The GW memory is a permanent displacement between freely falling test masses that is induced by the passage of a GW \cite{Christodoulou:1991cr,PhysRevD.44.R2945,Blanchet:1992br,Favata:2008ti,Favata:2009ii,Pollney:2010hs,Lasky:2016knh,Hubner:2019sly,Ebersold:2020zah,Zhao:2021hmx}. 
For GW experiments based on interferometry, it was shown 
the non-linear memory could be directly detectable if a sufficient portion of the memory is induced on a timescale $\tau \approx 1/f_\text{opt}$ where $f_\text{opt}$ is the frequency of the detector's peak sensitivity \cite{PhysRevD.45.520} (see Ref.~\cite{Johnson:2018xly} for a summary of the future detection prospects at sub-kHz experiments). 
Following Ref.~\cite{Johnson:2018xly} and Refs. therein, 
we model the $h_c$ signal as a step function $\Theta $ with an UV cut-off at the ISCO frequency, i.e.
\begin{equation}
h_c (f)	\simeq h_c^\text{\tiny mem} \Theta (f_\text{\tiny ISCO} -f ).
\end{equation}
The value of the strain amplitude, averaged over source orientations and sky positions, can be estimated to be a fraction of the GW signal at peak frequency~\cite{PhysRevLett.118.181103} as
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{\langle h_\text{\tiny mem}^2\rangle}{\langle h_\text{\tiny osc}^2 \rangle}} \simeq 1/20 \,. 	
\end{equation}


As the GW memory signal extends to much smaller frequencies with respect to $f_\text{\tiny ISCO}$, it was recently shown in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevLett.118.181103} that one could significantly outperform some UHF-GW experiments in the search for signals in the MHz frequency range by looking for the corresponding GW memory at ground-based detectors (see also Refs.~\cite{Domenech:2021odz,Lasky:2021naa}). 
Following the same logic, we check whether a population of PBH mergers shown in Figs.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single} and \ref{fig: PBH hc SGWB}
 would leave a detectable GW memory signal at GW interferometric searches at lower frequencies. 
The GW strain signals turns out to be 
\begin{equation}
h_c^\text{\tiny mem} \sim 4.8 \times 10^{-31} 
\lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-12} M_\odot } \rp
\lp \frac{d_\text{\tiny L}}{\rm kpc} \rp ^{-1} \,.
\end{equation}
As one can see, the strain induced by the memory effects of PBH of mergers with masses $m \lesssim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ at a distance $d_\text{\tiny yr}$ (indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig: dist})  would fall much below the forecasted sensitivity curves of both LISA and 3G detectors. Also, we notice that the early inspiral phase shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single} would be associated with larger strain signals (scaling as $h_c \sim f^{-1/7}$) in the sub-kHz range. 
Therefore, we conclude that the memory signature persisting at lower frequency even for light PBH mergers may not allow for a detection at sub-kHz interferometric detectors.
We conclude this section by mentioning that the memory strain would still cross some of the sensitivity bands of UHF-GW detectors (such as GB and JURA, see Sec.~\ref{sec:Detectors} for more details on these detectors). The nature of the signal, however, is very different from the one assumed to derive sensitivity curves for these detectors (that is a plane monochromatic wave). 
Therefore, a dedicated study on the feasibility of measuring such a signature is still required.

\subsection{Black hole superradiance}
\label{sec:Superradiance}

In this section we discuss the possible interplay between a light PBH population and a light scalar field. The possible coexistence of the two would give rise to GW signatures that may be used to constrain both sectors. 
It is fair to admit, however, that such a scenario assumes the existence of two distinct extensions of the current standard model of particle physics and cosmology. Nevertheless, it is worth understanding how such a scenario could be constrained by searching for UHF-GWs. 
The existence of light pseudo-scalars that would trigger the superradiance mechanism, such as \textit{axions}, is very well motivated from the UV perspective. The QCD axion for instance is one of the most promising proposals to solve the strong CP problem~\cite{Peccei:1977hh, Wilczek:1977pj, Weinberg:1977ma}. Furthermore, other types of axions (sometimes called \textit{axion-like particles}) are very common in string theory, arising from the existence of extra-dimensions as the Kaluza-Klein zero-modes of form fields~\cite{Arvanitaki:2009fg}.


GW emission can arise from clouds of light bosons in rotating BH backgrounds as a result of gravitational superradiance~\cite{Ternov:1978gq,Zouros:1979iw,Arvanitaki:2009fg,Arvanitaki:2010sy, Arvanitaki:2012cn, arXiv:2010.13157, Detweiler:1980uk,Yoshino:2013ofa,Arvanitaki:2014wva,Brito:2014wla,Brito:2015oca}. 
We note PBHs are expected to be produced with a very small spin in the standard scenario, i.e. from the collapse of large radiation overdensities \cite{DeLuca:2019buf,Mirbabayi:2019uph}. 
However, in alternative scenarios, such as the formation from an assembly of matter-like objects (particles, Q-balls, oscillons, etc.), domain walls and heavy quarks of a confining gauge theory, larger PBH spins at formation are predicted~\cite{Harada:2017fjm,Flores:2021tmc,Dvali:2021byy,Eroshenko:2021sez,DeLuca:2021pls,Chongchitnan:2021ehn,deFreitasPacheco:2020wdg}.
In case PBHs possessed a non-vanishing spin, one would expect superradiant instabilities to take place already in the early Universe and remove most of the angular momentum, leaving a population of slowly rotating PBHs. 
However, each PBH merger generates a spinning remnant with $\chi\simeq 0.68$~\cite{Barausse:2009uz} (assuming spin-less progenitors) and a mass around $m_f \simeq 2 \, m_\text{\tiny PBH}$. 
This process may trigger superradiant instabilities of light scalar fields in the present epoch, potentially leading to the emission of observable UHF-GW signatures~\cite{Aggarwal:2020umq}.
     
When the  Compton wavelength
of a boson (${\bf b}$) is  of the size of the BH, i.e
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:maMBH} 
m_{\bf b} \sim 10^{-4}\, \text{eV} \, \left( \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH} }{ 10^{-6}M_\odot} \right)^{-1}   
\,,
\end{equation}
the boson  accumulates outside the BH event horizon efficiently. The characteristic  timescale for the growth of the boson cloud for the dominant $\ell = m =1$ mode is \cite{Brito:2015oca}
\begin{equation}
\tau \sim 3 \times 10^{-5}\, {\rm sec} \lp\frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-6} M_\odot} \rp .
\end{equation}
The primary process  for the production of UHF-GWs is  annihilation of bosons, e.g. (pseudo-) scalars $\bf{b}$ into gravitons $h$. The associated GW frequency is
twice the Compton frequency of the boson, i.e.  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsprannihilation}
f \sim  2 \times  10^{6} \, \text{Hz} \left( \frac{m_b}{10^{-9} \, \text{eV}} \right) 
\sim
2 \times 10^2\,  {\rm GHz}\, \lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-6} M_\odot } \rp^{-1}
\, ,
\end{equation}
which corresponds to frequencies above 200 kHz for $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \lesssim M_\odot$. 
Note that this GW signal is  monochromatic and coherent~\cite{Arvanitaki:2014wva}, making it distinct from  other astrophysical or cosmological sources.  The expected characteristic GW amplitude for this process is\cite{Arvanitaki:2012cn} 
\begin{align}
    h_0 &
\simeq 5 \times 10^{-30}\,  
\frac{1}{\ell}
    \lp \frac{\alpha}{0.1}\rp 
        \lp \frac{\epsilon}{10^{-3}}\rp 
\lp \frac{d_\text{\tiny L}}{{\rm kpc}}\rp ^{-1} 
\lp \frac{m_\text{\tiny PBH}}{10^{-6} M_\odot}\rp,
\label{eq:strain_axion_annihilation}
\end{align}
where $\alpha = G m_\text{\tiny PBH} \, m_b$, $\ell$ is the orbital angular momentum number of the decaying  bosons and $\epsilon < 10^{-3}$ denotes the fraction the PBH mass accumulated in the  cloud. {The superradiance condition constrains $\alpha/\ell < 0.5$~\cite{Arvanitaki:2010sy}.} See Refs. \cite{Brito:2014wla, arXiv:2010.13157} for more recent calculations of the strain.

where $\chi^{i}$ and $\chi^{f}$ are the dimensionless
BH spin at the beginning and end of the superradiant growth.
We compare the expected GW signal amplitude from a source located at a distance $d_\text{\tiny yr}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc supperradiance} along with UHF-GW detector proposals.


Note that, despite restricting ourselves to the case of a (pseudo-) scalar, a similar phenomenon can occur in the presence of vector and tensor fields. In such cases though, the duration of the signal is much shorter than what is reported in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SuperradianceDuration},
making extremely challenging to detect PBH masses $m_{\text{\tiny PBH}} \lesssim 10^{-5} \, M_\odot$ (see Ref.~\cite{Brito:2015oca} for more details).\footnote{As reported in Ref.~\cite{Brito:2015oca}, the signal duration for vector and tensor superradiant instabilities as a function of the mass of the BH scales as
$\tau \sim 5 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{yr} \, \left({m_{\text{\tiny{PBH}}}}/{10^{-6} \, M_\odot}\right)$.}





\section{Reach of planned and future ultra-high frequency GW experiments}
\label{sec:Detectors}

In this section we discuss the detectability of the GW signals that are produced in the various scenarios discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHmergers} with current and planned technologies.

First, let us point out that
the detection of GWs becomes more difficult as their frequency increases. This is the case both for single events and for stochastic backgrounds of GWs. For instance, the amplitude of GWs at the ISCO frequency (that coincides with the characteristic strain, see Sec.~\ref{sec:SignalDuration}) for a BH merger is (see also Eq.~\eqref{eq:spawaveform2})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:StrainMergers}
h_0^{\text{\tiny ISCO}} \sim h_c^{\text{\tiny ISCO}} \simeq 
%1.82
2
 \times 10^{-23} \left(\frac{f}{{\rm GHz}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{d_\text{\tiny L}}{{\rm kpc}}\right)^{-1} \,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, for a SGWB characterised by a given GW energy density $\Omega_\text{\tiny GW}$, the GW strain scales as (see Eq.~\eqref{strain SGWB})
\begin{equation}\label{strain SGWB rep}
h_c^{\text{\tiny SGWB}} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-31} \left ( \frac{f}{{\rm GHz}} \right)^{-1} \left ( \frac{\Omega_\text{\tiny GW} }{10^{-7}} \right)^{1/2} .
\end{equation}
In both Eq.~\eqref{eq:StrainMergers} and Eq.~\eqref{strain SGWB} the strain decreases as $\propto 1/f$, showing that it is increasingly difficult to detect both types of signal (e.g. coming from the chirp phase of a binary PBH merger or from a cosmic accumulation of events that produce a copious amount of energy density in GWs).

Currently, there are various proposals for detectors operating at frequencies higher than the range currently explored at LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, that is $(10 \div 10^3) \, \text{Hz}$. These can be divided into four broad categories, as we summmarise in the following.
%
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Mechanical resonators}
%

\item[2)] Resonant electromagnetic antennas, see~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau}, operating in the frequency range $(1 \div 10^3) \, \text{MHz}$, see Sec.~\ref{sec:Discussion} for more details;\footnote{Note that the concept of resonant antennas is very similar to SRFCs. However, the authors of~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau} suggest a way to extract the detector sensitivity that is sensitive to the GW amplitude at linear order, contrary to the case of SRFC, where the effect is at second order in $h_0$. As the proposal of~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau} does not account for noise sources yet, we do not include it in the plots. See also Sec.~\ref{sec:Discussion} for more comments on this concept.}

Note that not all the detectors mentioned above may be used to probe the various signals discussed in this work. 
Consider, for example, the SGWB produced by PBH mergers. 
As most of its contribution is emitted in the late-time Universe, it cannot be detected using data from radio telescopes, that can only probe the re-ionization epoch. 
In the next sections, we will provide other examples of detectors that may not be suitable to probe some of the GW signals produced by PBHs.

\subsection{Levitated Sensor Detectors}
\label{sec:lsd}
Levitated Sensor Detectors (LSDs) are mechanical resonators that operate as GW detectors in the frequency range $(10 \div 300) \, \text{kHz}$, with a bandwidth of $\Delta f \sim f/10$. These were initially proposed in~\cite{Arvanitaki:2012cn} and more recently developed further in~\cite{Aggarwal:2020umq}. In the simplest version~\cite{Arvanitaki:2012cn}, an LSD consists of a laser standing wave that propagates between two mirrors in a cavity. A dielectric nanoparticle placed close to an anti-node of the standing wave will experience a force that pulls the nanoparticle back to the anti-node, which is then an equililbrium position of the \textit{optical potential}: the dielectric nanoparticle is \textit{optically trapped}. The position of the anti-nodes and the intensity of the restoring force (i.e. the optical potential) depend on the intensity of the laser and on the dielectric constant of the nanoparticle, and can be tuned by varying these external parameters. A second laser, whose intensity is much lower compared to the one used to build the optical trap, can be used to read out the position of the nanoparticle. If a GW goes through the detector\footnote{Only the component of the GW that propagates orthogonally to the axis of the cavity is relevant here.}, it modifies the proper distance between the mirrors of the cavity as well as the distance between the mirrors and the nanoparticle. This causes a nanoparticle initially at rest in an equilibrium position to move, subject to the optical potential. If the GW frequency matches the optical frequency, a resonance in the oscillation of the nanoparticle is triggered: this can be observed using the second, weaker, laser. The sensitivity of LSDs depends crucially on various factors: it improves using longer cavities, more massive nanoparticles and cooler environments. At the moment, a one-meter prototype is under construction at Northwestern University, while different possible improvements have been suggested. The best design sensitivity proposed so far could be achieved with a $100$-meter cryogenic setup, which would reach a power spectral density sensitivity of $\sqrt{S_n} \simeq 10^{-23} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at $f \gtrsim 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$~\cite{Aggarwal:2020umq}. Such an instrument would employ various technical upgrades with respect to the simplest version~\cite{Aggarwal:2020umq}, including for instance a Michelson interferometer configuration to remove common noise, and the use of a multi-layered stack of dielectric discs, to make the suspended object more massive. We will use this theoretically designed detector as a benchmark for our estimates of the sensitivity, assuming a power spectral density sensitivity of $\sqrt{S_n} = 10^{-23} \, \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$, a frequency band of $(1 \div 1.1) \times 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$, where we are using that $\Delta f = f/10 \sim 10^4 \, \text{Hz}$. We can then compute the sensitivity to the amplitude of GWs produced by a BH binary with mass $m_{\rm PBH}$. In order to convert between power spectral density $\sqrt{S_n}$ and characteristic strain $h_c$, we recall that
\begin{equation}
h_c = \sqrt{\frac{f^2}{\Delta f} S_n} \,.
\end{equation}
Once we have the characteristic strain $h_c$, we can use Eq.~\eqref{eq:StrainMonochromatic} to compute the GW amplitude $h_0$, employing Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ncycles} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:dotf} to evaluate the number of cycles spent by the signal in the detector bandwidth. The final expression for a GW signal coming from a BH binary with mass $m_{\rm PBH}$ is
\begin{equation}
h_0 = 2.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \left(\frac{m_{\rm PBH}}{M_\odot}\right)^{5/6} \,.
\end{equation}
}

\subsection{Conversion in an external static magnetic field}
\label{sec:GertEffect}

One of the most promising classes of detectors is based on the conversion of GWs into electromagnetic radiation, known as inverse Gertsenshtein effect~\cite{gertsenshtein1962wave, Boccaletti1970ConversionOP}. In its simplest implementation, a detector that exploits the inverse Gertsenshtein effect consists of a conversion region of length $L$ and area $A$ (e.g. let us assume that it is a cylinder) that hosts a static magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder (say $\hat{z}$). A plane wave GW traveling along the axis of the conversion region generates an electromagnetic wave traveling in the same direction,\footnote{Note that there is also an electromagnetic component parallel to the static magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$~\cite{Berlin:2021txa}.} whose amplitude is proportional to the square of the GW amplitude $h_c$ (or $h_0$, for coherent GW signals), to the square of the length of the conversion region $L$ and to the square of the strength of the static magnetic field $|\mathbf{B}| \equiv B$. Therefore, the electromagnetic power that is produced in the presence of a SGWB whose amplitude is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:StochasticStrain} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EMpower}
P_\text{\tiny EM}(f) = \frac{\pi^2}{4 \mu_0 c} A B^2 L^2 f^2 |h_c(f)|^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant. In the case of an inspiral or a monochromatic source, such as superradiance, $h_c$ should be replaced by $h_0$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:EMpower}, see also Eq.~\eqref{eq:StrainInspirals}. This electromagnetic power can then be revealed at the end of the conversion region through appropriate detectors whose properties depend on the frequency of interest.

In order for this effect to be efficient, it is important that the phase coherence between the GW and the produced electromagnetic wave is mantained~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}, namely that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PhaseCoherence}
f \gg \frac{0.45}{\pi} \frac{L}{A} \simeq 4.3 \times 10^7 \, {\rm Hz} \, \left(\frac{L}{{1 \, \text{m}}}\right) \left(\frac{{1 \, \text{m}}}{\sqrt{A}}\right)^2 \,.
\end{equation}
For instance a hypothetical cylindrical detector with $L = 1 \, \text{m}$ and area $A = 0.785 \, \text{m}^2$ (corresponding to a radius of $0.5$ m) can operate at $f \gg 4.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{Hz}$. It is interesting to notice that the idea behind these detectors is similar to the one underpinning various axion experiments, including telescopes such as CAST~\cite{Zioutas:1998cc, GraciaGarza:2015sos} (decommissioned) and IAXO~\cite{Ruz:2018omp} (planned) and ‘light-shining-through-a-wall’ experiments such as OSQAR~\cite{OSQAR:2015qdv, OSQAR:2013jqp} (decommissioned), ALPS~\cite{ALPS:2009des, Ehret:2010mh} (decommissioned), ALPS II~\cite{Bahre:2013ywa, Albrecht:2020ntd} (under construction) and JURA~\cite{Beacham:2019nyx} (proposal).
Using data already collected in axion experiments such as OSQAR and CAST, it is possible to place bounds on the presence of a stochastic background of GWs at the frequency at which these detectors naturally operate~\cite{Ejlli:2019bqj}, which is extremely high: $f \sim 10^{15} \, {\rm Hz}$ and $f \sim 10^{18} \, {\rm Hz}$. It is, on the other hand, possible to adapt the photon receivers of such detectors in order to be sensitive to GWs at lower frequencies, see e.g.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist}, where two options for receivers that operate around the $\mathcal{O}(10) \, {\rm GHz}$ were considered. In the following, we will only use the most promising proposal which entails the use of Single Photon Detectors
 (SPDs) to reveal the electromagnetic wave induced by the GW. For this proposal the sensitivity reported in Ref.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} is\footnote{Note a $\sqrt{2}$ difference with respect to~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} due to the different definition of the characteristic strain in Eq.~\eqref{eq:StochasticStrain}.}
\begin{align}
h_c^{\text{\tiny SPD}} \simeq \,\,
&2.64 \times 10^{-24} \left(\frac{S/N}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{{1 \,\rm yr}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}} \left(\frac{\Delta f}{10^{11} \, {\rm Hz}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \nonumber \\
& \times \epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}} \left(\frac{\Gamma_D}{10^{-3} \, {\rm Hz}}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \left(\frac{B}{1 \, \text{T}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{L}{1 \, \text{m}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{A}{1 \, \text{m}^2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \,,
\label{eq:SPDsensitivity}
\end{align}
where $S/N$ is the signal-to-noise ratio that one wants to achieve, $\Delta t$ is the measurement time, $f$ is the frequency of the GW, $\Delta \omega = 2 \pi \Delta f$, $\epsilon$ is the single photon detection efficiency, $\Delta f$ is the bandwidth of the receiver, and $\Gamma_D$ is the dark count rate. We invite the reader to check Ref.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} for more comments on the experimental feasibility of the benchmark values used in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SPDsensitivity}. Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:SPDsensitivity} is actually the expression for $h_0^\text{\tiny SPD}$ instead of $h_c^\text{\tiny SPD}$ when it refers to coherent sources, such as inspirals and superradiance.


We stress that, while in principle it is possible to tune the central frequency of the detector, it is always necessary to be in the regime where Eq.~\eqref{eq:PhaseCoherence} is satisfied. Given the specifics of the experiments ALPS II ($B = 5.3 \,\text{T}$, $L = 210 \, \text{m}$, $A \simeq 0.02 \, \text{m}^2$), IAXO ($B = 2.5 \,\text{T}$, $L = 20 \, \text{m}$, IAXO will use $8$ tubes, each of which has area $A \simeq 0.4 \, \text{m}^2$) and MADMAX ($B = 4.83 \,\text{T}$, $L = 6 \, \text{m}$, $A \simeq 1.23 \, \text{m}^2$) using Eq.~\eqref{eq:PhaseCoherence} we can compute the minimum frequency that can be probed by these experiments:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CutoffFrequency}
f_\text{\tiny min}^{\text{\tiny ALPS}} 
\gg 4.6 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm Hz} \,, 
\qquad 
f_\text{\tiny min}^{\text{\tiny  IAXO}} 
\gg 2.2 \times 10^{9} \, {\rm Hz} \,, \qquad f_\text{\tiny min}^{\text{\tiny  MADMAX}} 
\gg 2.1 \times 10^{8} \, {\rm Hz} \,.
\end{equation}
Given that the amplitude of the signal drops at higher frequencies, IAXO and MADMAX appear to be the most suitable experiment to probe the signals that we are interested in.

From Eq.~\eqref{eq:SPDsensitivity}, it is clear that the sensitivity depends crucially on the combination $B L A^{1/2}$ and on the measurement time $\Delta t$. 
In particular, the dependence $\left({\Delta t}/{\rm yr }\right)^{-1/4}$ proves that the sensitivity gets better when the signal remains for a sufficiently long time 
in the observable frequency band of the detector. 
This excludes immediately the possibility of detecting the chirp phase of light PBH mergers with these types of detectors.
Indeed, combining Eqs.~\eqref{eq:fISCO} and \eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}, one finds that the final phase of a PBH merger would only last for 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta t \sim {\cal O}(1) \times \frac{1}{f_\text{\tiny ISCO}} 
	\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-8}) \, {\rm sec},
\end{equation} 
where the frequencies must be $f \gtrsim 10^{8} \, {\rm Hz}$ to satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:PhaseCoherence}. 
An ideal candidate signal would be the one coming from superradiant bosonic fields, that gives monochromatic GWs
with a long coherence time.

However, it is also possible to detect the early inspiral phase of single light PBH mergers: 
as the PBH binary gets closer to merging, the frequency of the produced GW grows, spanning the detector sensitivity range from low to high frequencies. 
If the change in frequency is slow enough, the signal remains in the detector sensitivity band for a sufficient time interval, potentially allowing for detection. 
Of course, this type of detector is well suited for the probe of SGWB signals, given that the integration time is not an issue in that case. 

Given that the graviton-to-photon conversion is sensitive to the GW amplitude propagating along the direction of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, one should account 
for the effective contribution of the GW amplitude along the 
detector principal axis. 
As the photon emission depends quadratically on the GW strain, in the case of SGWBs we may consider the average over all the orientations, which amounts to a factor $\langle \cos^2(\theta)  \rangle \simeq 1/2$. 
In the case of single event mergers we should keep in mind that the sensitivities reported here are maximum values: the signal would be suppressed by a factor ${\cal O}(1)$ depending on the orientation and specific details of the experimental apparatus.

In the analyses of Sec.~\ref{sec:Comparison} we will always assume that the detectors have $S/N = 2$, $\Gamma_D = 10^{-3}$ and $\epsilon = 1$. In particular, we will consider three possibilities: \textit{i)} a hypothetical SPD detector (HSPD) that spans a frequency range of $\Delta f = 5 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz}$ with minimum frequency $f_\text{\tiny min} = 5 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz}$ and parameters equal to the benchmark values of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SPDsensitivity} ($B = 1 \, \text{T}$, $L = 1 \, \text{m}$, $A = 0.785 \, \text{m}^2$ (corresponding to a radius of $0.5 \, \text{m}$); \textit{ii)} MADMAX, with the specifics above and spanning the frequency range $f \subset(2 \div 4) \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}$; \textit{iii)} IAXO, with the specifics above and spanning the frequency range $f \subset(2.8 \div 5.1) \times 10^{10} \, \text{Hz}$.
\footnote{Note that, in this section, we are assuming that the scaling of sensitivity as a function of observation time given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SPDsensitivity} remains valid.
If the number of photons expected in the photon detector is smaller than one, the sensitivity might degrade further and would need a dedicated analysis.}

\subsection{Experiments based on a Gaussian beam}
\label{sec:GB}

A different design~\cite{Li:2000du, Li:2003tv, Li:2004df, Li:2006sx, Li:2008qr, Tong:2008rz, Stephenson:2009zz, Li:2009zzy, Li:2011zzl, Li:2013fna, Li:2014bma, Li:2015nti} that still makes use of the graviton-to-photon conversions entails the use of an additional ingredient: a \textit{Gaussian beam} (GB) with frequency $f_0$ placed in the same direction of the conversion volume axis. A GW traveling along the same $z$-axis can give rise to an induced electromagnetic wave in the direction orthogonal both to the GB and to the static magnetic field. The induced electromagnetic wave is generated at first order in the amplitude of the GW, leading to a potentially large gain in sensitivity with respect to the detectors described above. 
In turn, however, the noise due to the GB photons can be quite large. 
To mitigate this issue, it was proposed to use reflectors in order to focus the induced electromagnetic wave in the direction of the receivers~\cite{Li:2008qr, PhysRevLett.89.223901, doi:10.1063/1.1553993, Hou:05, Woods:2012upj, Ringwald:2020ist}. 
The sensitivity reported in Ref.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:GBsensitivity}
&
h_c^{\text{\tiny  GB} }
\simeq 
2.8
\times 10^{-29} \, \eta^{-1} \left(\frac{S/N}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\Delta t}{10^4 \, {\rm sec}}\right)^{-1/2} \left(\frac{\Delta f_0/f_0}{10^{-6}}\right)^{-1} \nonumber \\
&\times \epsilon^{-1} \left(\frac{\Gamma_D}{10^{-3} \, {}\rm Hz}\right)^{1/2} \left(\frac{E_0}{5 \times 10^5 \, {\rm V}/{\rm m}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{B}{10 \, {\rm T}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{L}{5 \, {\rm m}}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{\Delta A}{0.01 \, {\rm m}^2}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{\mathcal{F}}{10^{-5}}\right)^{-1} \,,
\end{align}
where $0 < \eta < 1$ is the reflectivity of the reflectors, $\Delta t$ is the measurement time, $\Delta f_0$ is the bandwidth of the detector, $E_0$ is the amplitude of the electric field of the GB, $\Delta A$ is the surface of the electromagnetic wave detector and $\mathcal{F}$ is a function that depends on the geometry of the experimental setup, see Ref.~\cite{Ringwald:2020ist} for more details.
The benchmark values for the various experimental quantities represent the state-of-the-art values that can in principle be achieved in the laboratory.

Note that this detector works at resonance: the orthogonal electromagnetic wave is produced efficiently only if the frequency of the GW matches exactly the frequency of the GB, $f_0$. For this reason, such a detector is not suitable for the detection of coherent signals from PBH inspirals, see the discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect}. However, this concept can in principle be used to detect monochromatic signals such as superradiance, as long as the GW frequency matches the GB frequency to a very good accuracy ($\Delta f/f \sim 10^{-6}$), or SGWBs. 
In the former case, assuming that it is possible to tune the frequency of the detector to match the GW frequency of the source, the GB detector would be able to observe/exclude superradiance from PBHs in the mass range $(10^{-6} \div 10^{-5}) \, M_\odot$, which would correspond to a (pseudo-) scalar mass of $\sim 10^{-4} \, \text{eV}$. In that case, the sensitivity in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GBsensitivity} would refer to the GW amplitude, $h_0$.

It is necessary to emphasize that the feasibility of the experimental apparatus including the reflectors, maintaining the exceptional sensitivity that is reported in the original theoretical papers, has been questioned multiple times and seems extremely difficult to be achieved. Beyond the issues related to diffraction effects caused by the reflectors~\cite{Woods:2012upj}, the original papers do not take into account the noise due to the fact that the laser cannot be exactly linearly polarized in one direction, which would likely dominate the noise budget.\footnote{We thank Sebastian Ellis for pointing out this issue.} More studies to explore the feasibility of such a concept are a necessary step to be taken in the future, in order to assess all the possible noise sources that might deteriorate the sensitivity.

\subsection{Resonant LC circuits}
\label{sec:Haloscopes}

It has recently been shown that axion haloscopes results can be reinterpreted as limits on GWs in the UHF band~\cite{Domcke:2022rgu}. This is the case because, similarly to what happens if axions are present, a passing GW produces an effective current in Maxwell's equations, that causes the existence of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.\footnote{This class of experiments (as well as that described in Sec.~\ref{sec:MicrowaveCavities}) also makes use of the inverse Gertsenshtein effect. The main differences with respect to the type of detectors described in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect} are the geometry of the setup and the way in which the electromagnetic wave generated by the passing GW is measured: while in the case of Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect} the detector counts the photons in the generated electromagnetic wave, resonant LC circuit detectors measure the generated magnetic flux.} In particular, data from experiments like ABRACADABRA~\cite{Kahn:2016aff, Ouellet:2018beu, Ouellet:2019tlz, Salemi:2021gck} and SHAFT~\cite{Gramolin:2020ict} already put bounds on UHF-GWs, despite their sensitivity is not yet competitive with other bounds in the same frequency range. In Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2022rgu}, the authors show that in a setup geometry similar to the ABRACADABRA one, with a toroidal static magnetic field, a passing GW produces a magnetic flux at the center of the toroid. This flux can be detected using a pickup loop for which it is demonstrated that the most efficient geometry is a figure $8$ shape.

Interestingly, this type of detector can probe very short signals. In fact, in the case of axions, a signal coherent for a time of order $\mathcal{O}(\mu\text{sec})$ can be probed, corresponding to an axion mass of order $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \text{neV}$. Such a coherence time, which can be written in terms of the quality factor of the signal $Q$: $\tau = Q/f$, corresponds exactly to that of a PBH merger in the chirp phase at $f \sim 1 \, \text{MHz}$, namely $\tau \sim 1/f_\text{\tiny ISCO} \sim \text{MHz}^{-1} \sim 1 \, \mu\text{sec}$. For such a signal one has $Q \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, from Eq.~\eqref{eq:fISCO}, with resonant LC circuit detectors it is possible to probe the chirp phase of PBHs with masses around $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \simeq 10^{-3} \, M_\odot$. Better sensitivities can be achieved if the signal is coherent on longer timescales, i.e. when $Q \gg 1$, as it is the case for superradiance for instance: the sensitivity scales as $Q^{-1/4}$. Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2022rgu} shows that major progress can be achieved in the future, as the sensitivity scales with the volume of the region containing a static magnetic field as $V^{7/6}$. Therefore, experiments like DMRadio~\cite{Chaudhuri:2014dla, Silva-Feaver:2016qhh} and improvements thereof will be able to probe an interesting region of the parameter space. 
For DMR detectors, the curves that we plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} refer to the best case future scenario: DMradio with a magnetic field volume of $100 \, \text{m}^3$ and figure 8 pick-up loop to detect the magnetic field flux. 

\subsection{Microwave cavities}
\label{sec:MicrowaveCavities}

Another class of experiments that have been developed in the context of axion searches but turn out to be equally useful for the detection of UHF-GWs is given by microwave cavity experiments, see e.g.~\cite{Berlin:2021txa, Berlin:2022hfx}. As for the concept described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Haloscopes}, a GW passing through a cavity containing a static magnetic field produces an effective current in Maxwell's equations. This, in turn, gives rise to an electromagnetic field that oscillates at the same frequency of the GW. Such induced electromagnetic field might be detected using resonant detectors such as microwave cavities. In particular, data from axion experiments can be used to place bounds on UHF-GWs, as shown in Ref.~\cite{Berlin:2021txa} where the authors computed the projected sensitivity of ADMX~\cite{ADMX:2021nhd, ADMX:2019uok, ADMX:2018ogs}, HAYSTAC~\cite{HAYSTAC:2018rwy}, CAPP~\cite{Lee:2020cfj} and ORGAN~\cite{McAllister:2017lkb}.

Following Ref.~\cite{Berlin:2021txa}, we consider a cylindrical cavity (whose volume is $V_\text{\tiny cav}$) that contains a static magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ whose direction is parallel to the axis of the cavity. Assuming a cavity-GW coupling coefficient $\eta_n$ and system temperature $T_\text{\tiny sys}$, the sensitivity of such a cavity can be estimated as
\begin{align}
h_0 = \,\, &
3 \times 10^{-22}
\left(\frac{0.1}{\eta_n}\right)
\left(\frac{8 \, \text{T}}{|\bf B|}\right) 
\left(\frac{0.1 \, \text{m}^3}{V_\text{\tiny cav}}\right)^{5/6}
\left(\frac{10^5}{Q}\right)^{1/2} 
\nonumber \\
& \times    
\left(\frac{T_\text{\tiny sys}}{1 \, \text{K}}\right)^{1/2} 
\left(\frac{1 \, \text{GHz}}{f}\right)^{3/2}
\left(\frac{\Delta f}{10 \, \text{kHz}}\right)^{1/4} 
\left(\frac{1 \, \text{min}}{\Delta t}\right)^{1/4}
\,,
\end{align}
where the benchmark values are taken from the ADMX experiment.  Ref.~\cite{Berlin:2021txa} shows that a cavity-GW coupling coefficient of order $\eta_n \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ is a reasonable assumption for the modes ($T_{010}$ and $T_{020}$) already used in axion experiments such as ADMX and ORGAN. 
Note that the quality factor $Q$ and the cavity bandwidth $\Delta f$ are linked through the relation $\Delta f \simeq f/Q$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} we plot the sensitivity curves for the two most promising detectors: ADMX and SQMS. For these curves we took the parameters reported in~\cite{Berlin:2021txa} $f \subset(0.65 \div 1.02) \, \text{GHz}$, $Q \sim 8 \times 10^4$, $|\mathbf{B}| = 7.5 \, \text{T}$, $V_\text{\tiny cav} = 136 \, \text{L}$ and $T_\text{\tiny sys} = 0.6 \, \text{K}$, while for SQMS we used $f \subset(1 \div 2) \, \text{GHz}$, $Q \sim 10^6$, $|\mathbf{B}| = 5 \, \text{T}$, $V_\text{\tiny cav} = 100 \, \text{L}$ and $T_\text{\tiny sys} = 1 \, \text{K}$. We also take $\eta_n = 0.1$ in both cases, while the integration time used is given by the intrinsic timescale dictated by the frequency evolution of the inspiraling PBH binary, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}. The duration of the signal has to be longer than the \textit{ring-up time} of the cavity, determined by the inverse of the bandwidth. Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}, this requirement sets an upper limit on the mass of the PBHs whose mergers can be probed by microwave cavities. 
Therefore, as we will show in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents}, the ADMX and SQMS sensitivity curves apply to PBH inspirals with masses  
$m_\text{\tiny PBH} \lesssim 10^{-9} \, M_\odot$ and 
$m_\text{\tiny PBH} \lesssim 10^{-10}\, M_\odot$ , respectively \cite{Berlin:2021txa}.



\subsection{Realistic comparison with GW signals from PBH mergers}
\label{sec:Comparison}

In this section we explore how the assumptions that lie behind the most promising detector curves reported above (e.g. in Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single} and Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc SGWB}) affect the detectability of the GW signals from PBH mergers. 



\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8 \textwidth]{Plots/PlotSingleEvents_3.pdf}
\caption{
We plot characteristic GW amplitude $h_0$ emitted by a PBH binary merger at a distance $d_\text{\tiny L}=d_\text{\tiny yr}$.
Each color reports a different value of $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \subset (10^{-4}\div 10^{-11}) M_\odot$ as indicated in the insets. The highest part of the filled band corresponds to the strain obtained assuming the maximum theoretical merger rate $R_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny max}$ (see Sec.~\ref{sec:clustering}), 
while the lowest curve corresponds to the strain values obtained for $f_\text{\tiny{PBH}} = 1$ in the standard scenario using Eq.~\eqref{eq:Rlocal}. 
For each experimental apparatus, we report four different lines, corresponding to the four integration times allowed by the signal with masses spanning four decades below the heaviest observable merger. 
For example, considering for example the DMR detectors, each line from top to bottom corresponds to different integration times set by the maximum time spent by mergers of masses $m_\text{\tiny PBH}=(10^{-5}, 10^{-6}, 10^{-7},10^{-8}) M_\odot$ around the frequency of $f\simeq 400$ MHz. See the main text for a complete description of the detector specifications.
}\label{fig:PlotSingleEvents}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Detection prospects for PBH mergers (Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents})}

When comparing the signals from coherent sources with the various detectors, we plot the GW amplitude $h_0$ instead of the characteristic strain as the theoretical papers describing detector proposals assume a passing GW plane wave, whose amplitude is $h_0$.
Also, the sensitivity of each detector is computed accounting for the intrinsic GW signal duration, depending on the PBH masses and frequency and using Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} we plot the sensitivity curves corresponding to \textcolor{black}{the LSD detectors described in Sec.~\ref{sec:lsd}}, the SPD detectors described in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect} (HSPD, MADMAX and IAXO), resonant LC circuits described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Haloscopes} (DMR) and microwave cavities, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:MicrowaveCavities} (ADMX and SQMS). Concerning the GW signals, we plot the curves corresponding to PBH inspirals with mass $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \subset (10^{-4} \div 10^{-12}) \, M_\odot$. For each band, the upper curve saturates the maximum theoretical merger rate, see Sec.~\ref{sec:clustering}, while the lower curve corresponds to $f_\text{\tiny PBH} = 1$ in the standard scenario, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:Rlocal}.

\textcolor{black}{For LSD detectors, we used the benchmark values reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:lsd}. The sensitivity curves from top to bottom refer to PBH inspirals with masses
\begin{equation}
m_\text{\tiny PBH}\subset (10^{-4},10^{-5}, 10^{-6}, 10^{-7}) \, M_\odot \qquad \text{LSD}.
\end{equation}}

For the case of the SPD detectors described in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect}, the sensitivity curves from top to bottom refer to PBH inspirals with masses
\begin{equation}
m_\text{\tiny PBH}\subset  
\begin{cases}
(10^{-6}, 10^{-7}, 10^{-8}, 10^{-9}) M_\odot \qquad \,\,\,\,\, \text{HSPD}, \\
(10^{-7}, 10^{-8}, 10^{-9}, 10^{-10})M_\odot \qquad \,\,\text{MADMAX}, \\
(10^{-8}, 10^{-9}, 10^{-10}, 10^{-11})M_\odot \qquad \text{IAXO}, 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
respectively. Note that the short duration of the various signals in these frequency bands makes the sensitivity degrade significantly. 
We do not show smaller masses as the signal amplitude becomes increasingly distant from the detectors' reach.




For DMR detectors, the curves that we plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} are evaluated using the quality factors of the signals corresponding from top to bottom to 
\begin{equation}
m_\text{\tiny PBH}\subset (10^{-5}, 10^{-6}, 10^{-7}, 10^{-8}) \, M_\odot \qquad \text{DMR}.
\end{equation}
Note, therefore, that the top curve is applicable to the signal corresponding to
$M_\text{\tiny PBH} = 10^{-5} \, M_\odot$ PBH inspirals, which are close to the chirp phase ($Q \simeq 1$) at the right end of the DMR frequency band. For this case, which represents the best case scenario in terms of detectability, the gap between the DMR sensitivity curve and the loudest signal from PBH mergers (obtained under the assumption that the signal saturates the maximum merger rate, see Sec.~\ref{sec:clustering}) is only one order of magnitude.

Concerning microwave cavities, the requirement that the time spent by the signal in the detector band is larger than the ring-up time of the cavity implies that the ADMX and SQMS sensitivity curves can only apply to small enough PBHs masses, see the discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec:MicrowaveCavities}.
The sensitivity curves plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} apply to PBH inspirals with masses 
\begin{equation}
m_\text{\tiny PBH}\subset  
\begin{cases}
 (10^{-9}, 10^{-10}, 10^{-11}, 10^{-12})    M_\odot \qquad \,\, \text{ADMX}, \\
(10^{-10}, 10^{-11}, 10^{-12}, 10^{-13}) M_\odot \qquad \text{SQSM}, 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
 respectively. The integration time is given by the merger time of the PBH inspiral at the corresponding frequency of the various detectors. In the best case scenarios, ADMX and SQSM top curves to be compared with the maximum PBH inspiral signal for $M_\text{\tiny PBH} = 10^{-9} \, M_\odot$ and $M_\text{\tiny PBH} = 10^{-10} \, M_\odot$ respectively, there is still a gap of roughly five-six orders of magnitude.


\subsubsection{Detection prospects for a SGWB from PBH mergers (Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotStochastic})}

For a SGWB, we are not limited by the signal duration. In Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotStochastic}, we assume an integration time of one year for HSPD, MADMAX and IAXO. 
We also show the sensitivity of the GB detector, as from Eq.~\eqref{eq:GBsensitivity}, assuming integration times of one day (dashed line) and one year (solid line). To plot these curves, beyond all the benchmark values for $S/N$, $\Gamma_D$, $E_0$, $B$, $L$, $\Delta A$, $\mathcal{F}$, we assume $\eta = \epsilon = 1$ and that $\Delta f/f = 10^{-6}$, so that the frequency dependence disappears. We plot the signal in the range $(10^8 \div 10^{12}) \, \text{Hz}$ because this is the range explored in the literature~\cite{Li:2000du, Li:2003tv, Li:2004df, Li:2006sx, Li:2008qr, Tong:2008rz, Stephenson:2009zz, Li:2009zzy, Li:2011zzl, Li:2013fna, Li:2014bma, Li:2015nti, Hou:05, Woods:2012upj, Ringwald:2020ist, Ringwald:2020ist}.

Assuming that the sensitivity proposed for the GB design can be achieved, such a detector may constrain PBHs in the ultra-light mass range $m_\text{\tiny PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-13} M_\odot$, at least if a boosted merger rate close to $R_\text{\tiny PBH}^\text{\tiny max}$ is achieved. This would already represent a novel constraint on some scenarios for the asteroidal mass PBHs as DM which is notoriously difficult to probe with other means (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Montero-Camacho:2019jte}).

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:Discussion}

As we have seen in the previous sections, it is not possible to detect PBH-related GW signals using already operating detectors. One of the most compelling issues for many detectors is related to the short duration of the signal, which reduces the possibility of detecting transient signals in the UHF band, \textcolor{black}{as we have discussed for magnetic conversion detectors in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect}.}%We have discussed this problem  but it also applies to other UHF detectors. For instance, looking at Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single}, one would naively think that the gap between the largest PBH merger signal and the best LSDs sensitivity is about two orders of magnitude. However, the reported sensitivity for LSDs assumes an integration time of about $\Delta t \sim 10^6 \, \text{sec}$~\cite{Aggarwal:2020umq} in a bandwith $\Delta f \sim f/10$ (i.e. $\Delta f = 10^4 \, \text{Hz}$ for a central frequency of $f = 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$). Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:CoalescenceTime} one immediately realizes that the signal for the merger of $m_\text{\tiny{PBH}} = 10^{-6} \, M_\odot$ PBHs remains in the detector bandwidth $(1\div 1.1) \, 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$ for only $\Delta t \simeq 86 \, \text{sec}$, making the LSD sensitivity curve plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig: PBH hc single} inapplicable to the GW signal from such a PBH merger.

The currently most optimistic future prospects rely on the actual experimental implementation of the theoretical sensitivity of the GB detector, see Sec.~\ref{sec:GB}, whose feasibility has, however, been questioned~\cite{Woods:2012upj}. \textcolor{black}{Despite the benchmark LSD detector that we used for the sensitivity estimates in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} is only theoretically designed at the moment, this type of technology is currently being tested with the construction of a one-meter prototype and hence is likely to make progress in the near future. If the benchmark numbers could be achieved, this detector would be only one or two orders of magnitude away from the most optimistic PBH signal, at $10^5 \, \text{Hz}$, coming from PBH binaries with mass $(10^{-5} \div 10^{-6}) \, M_\odot$.} Furthermore, there are other interesting experimental concepts that have been proposed only very recently and might become the most promising routes forward. For instance, resonant cavities play a central role in a couple of very recent proposals~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau, Berlin:2021txa, Berlin:2022hfx}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotSingleEvents} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotStochastic}, we indicate the corresponding range of frequencies between vertical grid lines.
In Refs.~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau}, the authors suggest the use of resonant cavities to resonantly amplify the electromagnetic waves generated by the passing GW through the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:MicrowaveCavities}. The strain sensitivity for stochastic backgrounds reported in Refs.~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau} is $h_c \sim 10^{-30}$ in the frequency range $(10^6\div10^8) \, \text{Hz}$. If such an instrument could be implemented in the lab, then we would be able to observe the stochastic signal from unresolved PBH mergers, see Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotStochastic}.\footnote{We thank Sebastien Clesse and Nicolas Herman for private discussions on these points.}
The potentially testable parameter space would include large values of the abundance of PBHs in the asteroidal mass range with masses around $m_\text{\tiny{PBH}}\simeq 10^{-11} \, M_\odot$ within the ‘standard’ merger scenario.
However, the proposal of Refs.~\cite{Herman:2020wao, Herman:2022fau} is in a quite preliminary stage, and further studies about the noise sources that could deteriorate the sensitivity are still lacking. On the other hand, other proposals suggest the use of concepts already discussed in the context of axion DM experiments~\cite{Berlin:2019ahk, Berlin:2020vrk}. Preliminary results in this direction indicate that it might be possible to reach a sensitivity for coherent signals of $h_0 \sim 10^{-23}$ in the frequency range $(10^6\div 10^8) \, \text{Hz}$. Further analyses are currently being performed to assess all the possible noise sources present in this type of detector.\footnote{We thank Diego Blas and Raffaele Tito d'Agnolo for private discussions on these points.}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

Gravitational waves in the ultra-high-frequency band represent an interesting and promising avenue for the discovery of new physics. The challenging journey that will hopefully lead to gravitational wave detection in this frequency range has just started. As we have reviewed in this paper, an intense effort is required on the experimental side to reach the required sensitivities that could probe physically interesting gravitational wave strains. From the theoretical point of view, on the other hand, it is necessary to provide precise and physically sound targets, in order to guide the work on detector concepts.

One of the best-motivated sources in the ultra-high-frequency range is light primordial black holes which may be a promising candidate to explain the dark matter in our Universe.
Building upon the recent advancements in the modeling of primordial black hole merger rates, in this paper we have used state-of-the-art techniques to provide a systematic study of the possible gravitational wave signals that can be expected from various phenomena related to primordial black holes. 
Focusing on scenarios in which primordial black holes play a role as dark matter candidates, we have shown that the specific features of transient signals in the ultra-high-frequency band render detection particularly challenging with currently operating and proposed detectors. One of the issues in this context is the short duration of the signal that does not allow for a sizeable conversion of gravitational into electromagnetic waves. This problem prevents the use of some types of detectors, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:GertEffect}, for the detection of coherent signals. Other types of concepts though, such as \textcolor{black}{levitated sensor detectors}, resonant LC circuits and microwave cavities, do not suffer from this type of problem. \textcolor{black}{If the benchmark values  reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:lsd} for levitated sensor detectors could be achieved, then the sensitivity of this type of detector would be only one order of magnitude away from the most optimistic primordial black hole inspiral signals, at $f \sim 10^5 \, \text{Hz}$. Along with levitated sensors,} resonant LC circuits represent the best current prospect in terms of detectability, with their sensitivity missing the loudest gravitational wave signal from primordial black hole inspirals at $f \sim 30 \, \text{MHz}$ for just one order of magnitude.

The issue of the duration of the signal is avoided in the case of stochastic signals or persistent signals such as those coming from superradiance effects, but in these cases the strain is such that achieving detection remains beyond the capabilities of existing proposals. The main exception is represented by the Gaussian beam detector, assuming that the sensitivity reported in the theoretical studies of this concept can be achieved in the laboratories. 
This experiment could set a novel constraint on some scenarios for the asteroidal mass primordial black hole dark matter, which is notoriously difficult to probe with other means (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Montero-Camacho:2019jte}). 
A critical assessment of the feasibility of such detectors is a crucial theoretical and experimental step to be taken. 
Other proposals, especially those involving resonant cavities, might be promising alternative ways forward. There are various groups already involved in the effort of developing these ideas further.

We conclude with an optimistic note: in the last decades we have witnessed how the technological progress and the effort of many researchers have made it possible to overcome experimental difficulties that are similar to those now experienced in the context of ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves. 
Renowned examples are gravitational waves in the sub-$\text{kHz}$ range, where detection was finally achieved after decades of tireless efforts, and the case of axions, for which the most recent proposals would finally 
make it possible to probe almost the entire phenomenologically interesting parameter space. 
This paper provides further motivation to keep exploring ultra-high-frequency gravitational wave physics.\\


{\bf Note added:} During the completion of this work, we learned that the second version of Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2022rgu} was in preparation. 
In particular, in their App. III, the authors address some details of the computation of the merger rate of individual PBH binaries also discussed here. Where they overlap, the results are consistent with the ones presented here.

\section{Introduction}


Cosmic inflation \cite{Guth:1980zm,Starobinsky:1980te,Linde:1981mu,Albrecht:1982wi} is a period of accelerated expansion of the very early Universe that solves several puzzles in the standard hot Big Bang theory and provides an elegant mechanism for the production of the anisotropies observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\cite{Planck:2018vyg}. In the simplest models, the accelerated expansion is driven by a single slowly-rolling scalar field $\phi$, called the \textit{inflaton}. Current constraints \cite{Planck:2018jri} favour plateau-like potentials that open-up away from the minimum where inflation ends, such as the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models \cite{Kallosh:2013hoa,Kallosh:2013yoa}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
V(\phi) = \frac{m^2 \mu^2}{2} \left(1 - e^{\phi/\mu} \right)^2 ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ can vary over a wide range of scales and parameterises whether the potential is small field ($\mu \ll M_{Pl} $) or large field ($\mu \sim M_{Pl} $).
One poorly understood aspect of the early Universe is the period that connects inflation to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In particular, the details of \textit{reheating} \cite{Kofman:1994rk, Kofman:1997yn,Albrecht:1982mp}, the mechanism by which the energy density stored in the inflaton is transferred into the Standard Model (SM) sector, are unclear. The simplest channel is through the perturbative decay of the inflaton $\phi$ to SM particle(s) $\psi$, e.g. mediated by $\propto \phi \bar\psi \psi$ couplings in the Lagrangian.

Overdensities grow rapidly and collapse into stable oscillon-like objects. Movie: \url{https://youtu.be/vTl9agMfPB0}.} 
\label{fig:panel}
\end{figure*}

It is possible that some additional non-perturbative dynamics take place between the end of inflation and reheating, featuring resonances that lead to exponentially growing solutions for $\phi$. This process, known as \textit{preheating} \cite{Amin:2014eta}, has been extensively studied using both analytical and numerical techniques \cite{Amin:2010jq, Amin:2010dc, Amin:2011hj, Amin:2013ika, Felder:2006cc, Lozanov:2014zfa, Antusch:2015ziz, Antusch:2015vna, DeCross:2015uza,DeCross:2016fdz,DeCross:2016cbs,Kim:2017duj,Lozanov:2017hjm, Musoke:2019ima, Niemeyer:2019gab,Nguyen:2019kbm,Martin:2019nuw,Eggemeier:2020zeg,Iarygina:2020dwe,Sang:2020kpd,Martin:2020fgl,vandeVis:2020qcp,Kost:2021rbi,Garcia:2021iag,Eggemeier:2021smj,Kim:2021ipz,Figueroa:2022iho,Mahbub:2023faw}. These large fluctuations in the field can collapse into stable scalar field configurations known as \textit{oscillons}\footnote{We will collectively use the term \textit{oscillon} to denote all real scalar field pseudo-stable compact objects.} \cite{Bogolyubsky:1976nx,Bogolyubsky:1976sc,Gleiser:1993pt,Copeland:1995fq,Kasuya:2002zs,Saffin:2006yk,Hertzberg:2010yz,Salmi:2012ta,Gleiser:2019rvw,Antusch:2019qrr,Ibe:2019vyo,Zhang:2020bec,vanDissel:2023zva} and source a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs) \cite{Caprini:2018mtu,Dufaux:2007pt,Zhou:2013tsa,Antusch:2016con,Figueroa:2016ojl,Antusch:2017vga,Figueroa:2017vfa,Amin:2018xfe,Armendariz-Picon:2019csc,Armendariz-Picon:2020tkc,Hiramatsu:2020obh,Bhoonah:2020oov,Cai:2021gju,Adshead:2019lbr,Sang:2019ndv,Cui:2021are,Cosme:2022htl,Eggemeier:2022gyo,Krajewski:2022ezo,Lozanov:2022yoy}, which could be probed by future detectors targeting the $\mathrm{MHz-GHz}$ frequency band~\cite{Aggarwal:2020olq}. Given that the Universe is opaque to light before the release of the CMB photons, GWs might be the only way to directly probe such early epochs.


Our goal in this paper is to study to what extent gravity plays a role in the formation of (compact) oscillons during preheating, and to quantify the maximum compactness that can be achieved. Our results are summarised in Fig. \ref{fig:oscillon}, where we see that the interplay between the overdensity growth and Hubble rate results in a maximum compactness for each combination $(\mu,\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle)$. We focus on what is (arguably) the minimal case -- when the only field involved is the inflaton -- and investigate scales of the potential $\mu$, with self-consistent fluctuations $\delta\phi(t,\mathbf{x})$ in both the field and momentum that recover values of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio that are allowed by current Planck bounds \cite{Planck:2018jri}\footnote{Preheating could also involve an extra field that is not responsible for inflation, e.g. a string modulus \cite{Antusch:2017vga}, in which case parameters are not dictated by the observational constraints on inflation.}.

Preheating has been extensively studied using lattice field theory simulations \cite{Felder:2000hq,Frolov:2008hy,Figueroa:2020rrl, Figueroa:2021yhd} that evolve the scalar field equations on a homogeneous Friedmann-Lema{\^ i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, and neglect the backreaction of inhomogeneities on the local spacetime metric. These effects become important when overdensities grow large enough for gravity to be of the same order as self interactions in the field. As a first approximation, this can be accounted for by evolving a Newtonian potential with a Poisson equation sourced by the energy density~\cite{Lozanov:2019ylm, Amin:2019ums}.
Recently, a few works \cite{Kou:2019bbc, Giblin:2019nuv, Kou:2021bij} included the effects of the gravitational backreaction at the fully non-linear level of general relativity showing interesting phenomenological effects, that deviated from the evolution in a spatially constant expanding metric background.

In this paper we use numerical relativity to study a simple inflationary model with consistent fluctuations in both the scalar field and conjugate momentum at the end of inflation. In particular, we aim to quantify the compactnesses of the oscillons that are formed for different scales $\mu$ of the potential. For larger $\mu$, gravity enhances the growth of small overdensities during inflationary preheating, which then decouple from the Hubble flow, collapse and virialize, forming stable long-lived oscillon-like stars that reach compactnesses $\mathcal{C}\equiv GM/R \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$.  We find that $\mathcal{C}$ increases with the potential scale $\mu$, until it reaches a maximum value due to a balance between the overdensity growth rate and dilution due to the universe's expansion rate. This maximum compactness depends on the initial amplitude of the fluctuations and for $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle \approx 10^{-8}M_{Pl}^2$ is $\mathrm{max}(\mathcal{C})\approx 10^{-2}$. These compactnesses result in a significant backreaction on the local spacetime metric that may have implications for the amplitude of the gravitational-wave background but they are insufficient to collapse the objects into primordial black holes.\\

The paper is structured as follows: in Sec. \ref{sec:methods} we describe the key points of the methods used to set up and simulate the post-inflationary spacetime and track the evolution of perturbations. In Sec. \ref{sec:results-growth} we characterise the non-linear growth of the overdensities for different initial amplitudes $\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle$ and potential scales $\mu$. In Sec. \ref{sec:results-endpoint} we describe their endpoint as stable gravitationally bound objects and comment on their masses, radii and compactnesses. We conclude and suggest future directions in Sec. \ref{sec:conclusion}. Additional details of the numerics and testing are included in the Appendices \ref{app:numerics}, \ref{app:FLRW} and \ref{app:testing}.

\section{Simulating inflationary preheating}
\label{sec:methods}

The simplest single-field inflationary mechanism can be generated via the action \begin{equation}
    S = \int \dd^4 x \sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{M_{Pl}^2}{2}R - \frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mu}\phi\nabla^{\mu}\phi - V(\phi)\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $M_{Pl} = \sqrt{1/8\pi G}$ is the reduced Planck mass. The evolution of the scalar field is given by the Klein-Gordon equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EKG_cov}
    \nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu \phi - V'(\phi) = 0~,
\end{equation}
where $V(\phi)$ is the inflationary potential. The preheating mechanism can be understood by splitting the inflaton field in a homogeneous component and a perturbation, $\phi(t, \mathbf{x}) = \bar{\phi}(t) + \delta\phi(t, \mathbf{x})$. While the field is oscillating around the minimum of its potential, %after the end of inflation, 
the equation of motion for the perturbation mode $\delta\phi_k(t)$ (in Fourier space) becomes
\begin{equation}
    \delta\ddot\phi_k + \left(k^2 + V''\left(\phi(t)\right)\right) \delta\phi_k(t) = 0  \,,
    \label{eq:PerturbationsEOM}
\end{equation}
where the prime and dot denote differentiation with respect to the field $\phi$ and time, respectively. Here $\mathbf{k}$ is the wavemode considered and $k = |\mathbf{k}|$. Depending on the wavemode and details of $V(\phi)$, the equations of motion can feature resonances that lead to exponentially growing solutions for $\delta\phi$:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item If $\bar{\phi}(t)$ is a periodic function of time, $V(\phi)$ can act as driving force leading to a phenomenon called \textit{parametric resonance}. 
\item If $\bar{\phi}(t)$ repeatedly probes regions of the scalar potential where $V'' < 0$, perturbations can grow exponentially via \textit{tachyonic resonance}. 
\end{itemize}

In this work we will study these resonances within the inflaton field for the $\alpha$-attractor model in Eqn. \eqref{eq:potential}, where $\mu$ can vary over a wide range of scales\footnote{The Starobinsky model is a particular example where the scale $\mu$ and the Planck scale share a common origin $\mu = \sqrt{3/2}M_{Pl}$.} and parameterises whether the potential is small or large field, that is, how far in field space is the inflationary region from the reheating minimum, compared to $M_{Pl}$. Near the reheating minimum
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pot_expansion}
    V(\phi)\approx \frac{m^2\phi^2}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\phi}{\mu} + \frac{7}{12}\frac{\phi^2}{\mu^2}\right) + \mathcal{O}(\phi^5) \,.
\end{equation}
The average field value $\bar\phi(t)$ oscillates around the minimum at $\phi = 0$, giving rise to a matter dominated era. The odd powers of $\phi$ in the expansion in Eqn.~\eqref{eq:pot_expansion} ensure that the potential is shallower than quadratic for $\phi < 0$, so that $\phi$ particles feel an attractive force when the average field value is probing that region of the potential. Such an attractive force can stabilise overdensities in the field against dispersion, allowing the existence of oscillon-like solutions.\\



To describe the metric sector, we decompose the four-dimensional line element into the 3+1D ADM form
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -\alpha^2dt^2 + \gamma_{ij}(dx^i + \beta^i dt)(dx^j + \beta^j dt),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta^i$ are the lapse and shift gauge functions, and $\gamma_{ij}$ is the three-dimensional spatial metric. We also evolve the extrinsic curvature tensor $K_{ij}=\partial_{t} \gamma_{ij} + 2 D_{(i} \beta_{j)}$, which can be decomposed into a trace $K=\gamma^{ij}K_{ij}$  and a traceless part $A_{ij}$. In numerical relativity simulations it is common to decompose the spatial metric $\gamma_{ij}=\chi^{-1}\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$ with a conformally related metric $\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$ that has unit determinant $\tilde{\gamma} = 1$, whilst the traceless part of the extrinsic curvature is similarly rescaled as $\tilde{A}_{ij} = \chi A_{ij}$.  In the FLRW limit, the conformal factor is $\chi^{-1}=a(t)^2$ and the expansion $K$ is related to the Hubble parameter as $K=-3H$. In addition, the traceless part of the extrinsic curvature tensor contains details about the energy density in gravitational waves\footnote{This is equivalent to the energy density of the Isaacson energy momentum tensor $t_{00} = \langle\dot{h}_{\mu\nu} \dot{h}^{\mu\nu}\rangle /32\pi G$ when the perturbations are small and one can average over one period in spacetime \cite{Isaacson:1968hbi}.} as $\rho_\mathrm{GW}\propto \tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij}$.

\subsection{Initial conditions}

We study different $\alpha$-attractor models parameterised by the scale $\mu$. We set the homogeneous value of the scalar field prior to inflation $\phi_\mathrm{inf}=\phi(t_\mathrm{inf})$ by requiring inflation to last $\mathcal{N}=\ln(a) \approx 50$ e-folds. The mass $m$ is fixed such that fluctuations are consistent with the scalar power spectrum observed in the CMB \cite{Planck:2018jri}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_{\mathcal R}^2 = \frac{H_\mathrm{inf}^2}{8\pi^2 M_{Pl}^2 \epsilon(\phi_\mathrm{inf})} \approx 2\times 10^{-9} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the curvature perturbation.
We solve the ODE for the homogeneous equations of motion until the end of inflation (which corresponds to the beginning of reheating $t_\mathrm{reh}$), see Appendix \ref{app:numerics} for more details. We identify $\phi_{reh} = \phi(t_{reh})$ and $\dot{\phi}_{reh}= \dot{\phi}(t_{reh})$, which we use as the background on which to construct the inhomogeneous initial conditions for our scalar field and momentum
\begin{equation}
    \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \phi_{reh} + \delta\phi(\mathbf{x}) \qquad \dot{\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \dot{\phi}_{reh} + \delta\dot{\phi}(\mathbf{x}) ~.
\end{equation}
Assuming a random Gaussian field, the spectrum of sub-horizon scalar perturbations at the end of inflation is determined by quantum vacuum fluctuations, i.e.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PertSpectrum_main}
\mathcal{P}(k) &= \frac{\lambda}{2 a_\mathrm{reh}^2 \omega_k^2} \,, \\
\langle \delta\phi_\mathbf{k} \delta\phi_{\mathbf{k}'} \rangle &= (2\pi)^3 \mathcal{P}(k) \delta(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}') \,,
\end{align}
where $\omega_k = \sqrt{k^2 + a_\mathrm{reh}^2 V''(\phi_{reh})}$, $\lambda = 1$ and we choose the initial scale factor $a_\mathrm{reh}=a(t_\mathrm{reh})=1$. The spectrum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PertSpectrum_main} determines the variance of the field perturbations through the relation
\begin{equation}
\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle = \int d\log k \, \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} \mathcal{P}(k) \,,
\end{equation}
which will be one of the quantities varied in our simulation by considering the three cases $\lambda \in \{1, 10^2, 10^4\}$. Note that we are considering modes that are sub-horizon at the end of inflation and never exited the horizon during the inflationary stage.
These modes correspond to physical scales that are not constrained by CMB observations, but one may expect they have standard quantum vacuum fluctuation amplitudes. See Ref. \cite{Figueroa:2020rrl} and Appendix \ref{app:numerics} for more details about the lattice implementation.\\

The fluctuations source both the energy and momentum density components of the stress-energy tensor measured by the normal observers
\begin{align}
    \rho &= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_i \phi)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)~, \\
    S_i &= -\dot{\phi} \partial_i \phi~.
\end{align}
We solve both the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints to construct valid initial data for the scalar and gravitational sectors. We formulate the coupled system of non-linear elliptic equations using the CTTK method \cite{Aurrekoetxea:2022mpw}, which assumes an initially conformally flat metric $\tilde{\gamma}_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ and chooses an initial conformal (or equivalently, scale) factor. In this case we have chosen $\chi$ = 1 initially (equivalent to choosing $a(t_{reh})=1$ in the homogeneous case). The method then solves the constraints as an algebraic equation\footnote{Note that in the absence of inhomogeneities, this Hamiltonian constraint in the CTTK method reduces to the usual form of the Friedmann constraint $H^2 = \rho/3M_{Pl}^2$, since $K=-3H$.} and a Poisson-like equation that in the case in which initially $\chi=1$, reduce to
\begin{align}
    K^2 = \frac{3\rho}{M_{Pl}^2} + \frac{3}{2}A_{ij}A^{ij} \,,\\
    \delta^{jk}\partial_k A_{ij} = \frac{2}{3} \partial_i K + \frac{S_i}{M_{Pl}^2}~.
\end{align}
In some previous works $\dot{\phi}$ is set to zero in order to simplify the solution of the constraints. We find that including the homogeneous component of the scalar field momentum $\dot{\phi}_{reh}$ is crucial, because it allows the field to explore the tachyonic part of the potential during the first few oscillations, which significantly enhances the growth rate of overdensities. However, including fluctuations in the conjugate momenta of the field perturbations -- whilst technically correct -- does not appear to significantly impact the results.

\subsection{Evolution}

We evolve the BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations of general relativity \cite{Nakamura:1987zz,Shibata:1995we,Baumgarte:1998te} using the publicly available numerical relativity (NR) code \textsc{grchombo} \cite{Andrade:2021rbd, Radia:2021smk,Clough:2015sqa}, together with a modified version of the integrated moving puncture gauge \cite{Campanelli:2005dd,Baker:2005vv,Kou:2019bbc,Giblin:2019nuv}
\begin{equation}
    \partial_t \alpha = \frac{\alpha}{2}\left(K-\overline{K}\right) + \beta^i\partial_i \alpha~,
\end{equation}
where $\overline{K}$ is the proper-volume-averaged trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor. This gauge choice approximately ensures that simulation time is identified with the cosmic time coordinate rather than conformal time. For the latter choice (which has been used in previous works on early universe phenomena e.g. \cite{Aurrekoetxea:2019fhr,deJong:2021bbo,Joana:2020rxm,Joana:2022uwc}), the lapse function grows with the expansion, and as a result the timescale of the oscillation of the field around the reheating minimum becomes under resolved as $d\tau = \alpha dt$. Note that in simulations of strongly inhomogeneous spacetimes, gauge dependence of the physical quantities measured is practically unavoidable, so we need to take care in interpreting our results.

We consider the growth of density perturbations for a range of potential scales $\mu$ summarised in table \ref{fig:table}. We choose the size of our numerical domain to be approximately the Hubble length $L\approx H(t_\mathrm{reh})^{-1}$, which is mostly determined by the homogeneous components of the initial conditions. This choice introduces an infrared cutoff scale $k_\mathrm{IR}=2\pi/L$ of the modes that can be studied. Likewise, we enforce an ultraviolet cutoff $k_\mathrm{UV}=4k_\mathrm{IR}$ to ensure that modes in the lattice have good spatial resolution. We fix $L=64 m^{-1}$ for all simulations\footnote{This value corresponds to the largest Hubble length of the studied models (see table \ref{fig:table}), and is thus the most conservative choice to avoid artificial boundary effects (that is, imposing unwanted periodicity on scales that are in causal contact.}, which includes a range of modes $k/m \subset \{0.1,\, 0.4\}$ that experience parametric resonance. We evolve the perturbations until we see that either they collapse into compact objects and stabilise, or the growth saturates without forming compact structures.

\subsection{Diagnostics}


We focus on diagnostics that give us information about the local behaviour of the perturbations, such as the local density contrast 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{c} \equiv \frac{\rho_{c}}{\bar{\rho}} - 1~,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{c}$ is the central value of the overdensities and $\bar{\rho}$ is the mean energy density across the box, which approximately tracks the evolution of a matter-dominated spacetime $\bar{\rho}\sim a^{-3}$ due to the harmonic oscillations in the averaged field. Note that whilst $\delta_{c}$ can be calculated locally it does have a dependence on the global and local slicing (gauge choice) of the spacetime, since $\rho = \alpha^2 T^{00}$ is defined to be the value measured by the normal observers to the spatial slice (not in any rest frame of the fluid), and the averaging of $\bar{\rho}$ across the slice also depends on the gauge. Whilst one might worry that local measures are more sensitive to gauge dependence, particularly in highly dynamical regions, we have nevertheless found these useful in understanding the behaviour of the locally collapsing regions, especially once they decouple from the Hubble flow. Globally averaged measures do not distinguish between regions that are expanding with the Hubble flow and regions that are decoupled and form stable gravitationally bound objects, where the behaviour differs significantly.

Another local quantity that we will track is the compactness of the formed gravitating objects
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}\equiv \frac{G M}{R}~,
\end{equation}
where the limit $\mathcal{C}=1/2$ corresponds to black holes. Directly measuring the mass and radius of the compact objects is non trivial in our inhomogeneous simulations. We search for maximum densities $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ to identify the oscillons and define their surface as the region for which the energy density is $5\%$ of the central value $\rho^{c}_{osc}$. We then calculate their mass and proper volume as the following integrals over regions $\Omega = \{x^i: \rho/\rho^{c}_{osc}>5\% \}$
\begin{align}
    M &=\int_\Omega \dd^3x\sqrt{\gamma} \,\rho~, \label{eq:M}\\
    V &=\int_\Omega \dd^3x\sqrt{\gamma} ~, \label{eq:V}
\end{align}
where $\sqrt{\gamma}$ corresponds to the volume factor of the spatial metric which can be written solely in terms of the conformal factor $\sqrt{\gamma}=\chi^{-3/2}$. We then approximate the radius of the oscillon in terms of its proper volume (in the $t= \mathrm{constant}$ spatial hypersurface of the simulation) as $R=3V^{1/3}/4\pi $.



\section{Growth of overdensities}
\label{sec:results-growth}

The dynamics of overdensities for smaller field models is well-captured with FLRW, whereas for $\mu\gtrapprox 0.06M_{Pl}$ overdensities do not collapse and form oscillons.}
\label{fig:FRW}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure*}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{murho_comparison.pdf}
\caption{Growth of the maximum density contrast $\delta_{c}\equiv \rho_{c}/\bar{\rho} - 1$ (top panel) and evolution of central densities $\rho_{c}$ (bottom panel) for a range of potential scales $\mu$ and initial amplitude of fluctuations $\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle$. We see that the initial rate of growth of perturbations $\delta_{c}$ is largely insensitive to the initial amplitude of the fluctuations $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle$, with a stronger dependence on the scale of the potential $\mu$. The central value of the overdensities decays until they decouple and turn-around. When they collapse and virialize, oscillons form and the central densities stay at roughly constant values $\rho^{c}_{osc}$. These final central densities are mainly determined by the initial average densities $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$ and the growth rate of perturbations during parameteric resonance.}
\label{fig:murho_comparison}
\end{figure*}


In this section we describe the evolution of the density contrast over time, where we plot $\delta_{c}\left(a(t)\right)$ versus time (as measured by the scale factor $a$, which is obtained from the proper volume averaged conformal factor). In Fig.~\ref{fig:FRW}, we compare the results  -- using the same set of parameters -- from the numerical relativity simulations to those that evolve the initial perturbations on a simple spatially-averaged FLRW background. 
For $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle\approx 10^{-12}M_{Pl}^2$, the disagreement beyond $\mu\gtrapprox 0.06M_{Pl}$ is large enough for FLRW to not capture the collapse of overdensities. 

In the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:murho_comparison} we study the evolution of the density contrast for different scales of the potential $\mu$ using numerical relativity. We parameterise their initial growth as $\delta_{c}\propto a(t)^\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is a numerical factor that we fit from our simulations. In the cases studied, the fast growth of perturbations with $\sigma\gg 1$ is due to a combination of the parametric and tachyonic resonances together with the gravitational interaction. We find that the rate of growth of perturbations  $\sigma$ during the resonant phase most strongly depends on the scale of the potential $\mu$, whilst it seems largely insensitive to the initial amplitude of the perturbations $\delta_\mathrm{reh}=\delta_{c}(t_{reh})$. The values of $\sigma$ are larger for smaller field models (smaller $\mu$), meaning the resonance is stronger and overdensities grow faster. We can relate this to smaller field models exploring more of the tachyonic (concave) part of the potential after inflation. 

We parameterise the evolution of the central values of the overdensity $\rho_{c}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rhoc}
    \rho_{c}\left(a(t)\right) = \frac{\bar{\rho}_\mathrm{reh}}{a^3}\left(\delta_{reh} a^\sigma + 1\right).
\end{equation}
The central density decays as it expands with the background until it decouples from the Hubble flow at the turn-around time $a_{dec}=a(t_\mathrm{dec})$ and starts to collapse. We can estimate $a_{dec}$ as when  $d\rho_{c}/da=0$, which yields
\begin{align}\label{eq:adec}
    \ln a_{dec} &=\frac{1}{\sigma}\left[\ln\left(\frac{3}{\sigma-3}\right) -\ln\delta_{reh} \right].
\end{align}
These two terms show that $a_{dec}$ decreases for larger initial perturbations $\delta_{reh}$ and faster growth rates (larger $\sigma$), confirming the results in the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:murho_comparison}. Note that we only expect this estimate to be accurate in the case in which the overdensities decouple from the Hubble flow before the growth rate $\sigma$ changes. As the universe expands, the Hubble friction damps the amplitude of the homogeneous oscillations, reducing the resonance. This drives $\sigma$ to smaller values, and thus Eqn. \eqref{eq:adec} only provides a lower bound for $a_{dec}$. 

After decoupling, overdensities follow their own field and gravitational dynamics, with a characteristic timescale for the collapse that seems to be mostly dependent on $\rho^{c}_{dec} = \rho_{c}(a_{dec})$ via the free-fall timescale. During the collapse, the central densities $\rho_{c}$ bounce back to larger values until the overdensities virialize and saturate at a roughly constant density $\rho^{c}_{osc}=\rho_{c}(a_\mathrm{osc})$, forming stable scalar field configurations -- oscillons. This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:murho_comparison}, with the central density oscillating about some roughly constant value and giving rise to a density contrast scaling as $\delta_{c}\propto a^3$ due to the matter dominated average density decay $\bar{\rho}\propto a^{-3}$. It should be noted that, while in this paper we have collectively denoted pseudo-stable real scalar field configuration with the term \textit{oscillon}, when the pseudo-stability is due to gravitational effects, these configurations are more properly known as \textit{oscillatons} \cite{Kaup:1968zz,Ruffini:1969qy,Hogan:1988mp,Seidel:1991zh,Liddle:1992fmk,Seidel:1993zk,Kolb:1993zz,Kolb:1993hw,Urena-Lopez:2002ptf,Urena-Lopez:2001zjo,Alcubierre:2003sx,Valdez-Alvarado:2011xnr,Urena-Lopez:2012udq,Krippendorf:2018tei,Ikeda:2017qev}. 


\section{Oscillon formation}
\label{sec:results-endpoint}


We expect that the interplay between the overdensity growth rate and the Hubble expansion rate dictates the final values of the central densities $\rho^{c}_{osc}$, which in turn determine the properties of the oscillons that are formed. These depend on two factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] The central density decays until decoupling at $a_{dec}$: The smaller $a_{dec}$, the larger $\rho^{c}_{osc}$.
    \item[(ii)] Initially, the central density is approximately $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$: The larger $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$, the larger $\rho^{c}_{osc}$.
\end{itemize}


We can check (i) by looking at the results for a given model $\mu$, as those share the same initial density $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$. The bottom panels of Fig. \ref{fig:murho_comparison} confirm that overdensities that decouple the earlier (smaller $a_{dec}$) have larger final densities $\rho^{c}_{osc}$. 



Checking (ii) is more difficult as both $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$ and $a_{dec}$ play a role in a non-trivial manner.  Larger field models start from larger initial densities $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$, but experience weaker resonances with slower growth rates $\sigma$, resulting in longer decoupling times $a_{dec}$. There is therefore competition between these effects, such that larger initial $\bar{\rho}_{reh}$ can balance the extra decay from larger $a_{dec}$, resulting in $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ growing with  $\mu$.\\

Let us assume that the oscillon central density $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ is approximately determined by the densities at decoupling $\rho^{c}_{dec}$, which scale via Eqns. (\ref{eq:rhoc}-\ref{eq:adec}) as
\begin{equation}
    \rho^{c}_{osc}\propto \rho^{c}_{dec}=\bar{\rho}_{reh} \delta_{reh}^{1-x} x^{-x} (1-x)^{-(1-x)} ~,
\end{equation}
where we have defined $x\equiv (\sigma-3)/\sigma$ for convenience. Since $\rho^{c}_{osc}\propto \bar{\rho}_{reh}$, then $\rho^{c}_{osc}\propto m^2\mu^2$. The function $\delta_{reh}^{1-x}x^{-x}(1-x)^{-(1-x)}$ has a strong dependence on $\sigma$, which itself is very sensitive to the scale of the inflationary model $\mu$. We therefore expect that $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ will grow with $\mu$ if $\sigma \gg 3$, whereas the expansion will overtake (and $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ decay with $\mu$) as $\sigma\rightarrow 3$. Based on these arguments, the oscillon density $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ should peak at some value $(\mu,\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle)$. We confirm this in the top panel of  Fig. \ref{fig:MR_comparison}, where an initially increasing trend in the density can be observed up to  a critical $(\mu,\langle \delta\phi^2 \rangle)$, after which $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ decays.

Once the location of final central densities $\rho^{c}_{osc}$ is identified, we can compute other oscillon properties such as their mass and volume using Eqns. (\ref{eq:M}-\ref{eq:V}). The mass is related to the final central density of the oscillon, which depends on the details of the formation process as discussed above. It therefore also shows a peak for each model value $\mu$, as shown in the middle panel of Fig. \ref{fig:MR_comparison}. The radius $R$, on the other hand, is mainly determined by the mass $m$ around the reheating minimum 
%which is related to the period of the oscillation 
as $R\approx 2\pi /m$, bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:MR_comparison}. Hence the peak in the resulting compactnesses shown in Fig. \ref{fig:oscillon}. The values and error bars in Figs. \ref{fig:oscillon} and \ref{fig:MR_comparison} are estimated by computing the average and standard deviation of these properties over the last $0.2$ e-folds of the simulation.

The values and error bars are estimated by computing the average and standard deviation of the evolution of $\rho^{c}_{osc}$, $M$ and $R$ over the last $0.2$ e-foldings of the simulation.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have shown that perturbations from the most minimal preheating scenario -- that of resonance in a single field inflationary model that is consistent with current CMB observations -- can grow and collapse to form oscillons with compactnesses $\mathcal{C}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. In particular, we have observed that the interplay between the overdensity growth and Hubble expansion rates results in a maximum compactness that depends on $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle$ and can reach $\mathcal{C}\approx 10^{-2}$ in the regime we have studied. 


This is not sufficient to drive the oscillons to collapse to black holes, and it seems likely that increasing the initial amplitudes $\langle\delta\phi^2\rangle$ is the only way one could reach black hole formation\footnote{Previous works finding black hole formation \cite{Helfer:2016ljl, Michel:2018nzt, Widdicombe:2018oeo, Muia:2019coe, Nazari:2020fmk} have often started with highly compact initial perturbations, considered a higher degree of symmetry, or used smaller volumes comparable to the size of the overdensity itself, which may have prevented radiation from being efficient during the collapse (due to the use of periodic boundary conditions for example).}. However, that would take us outside of the values expected from our minimal inflationary preheating scenario as $\delta_{reh}\rightarrow 1$. Hence, we conclude that inflationary preheating is not enough to form primordial black holes without an additional enhancement mechanism of the perturbations.

Constraints on the scalar power spectrum fix the mass of the field $m\approx 10^{-5}M_{Pl}$ and set the size and mass of these relics to be $R\approx 10^{-33} \,\mathrm{km}$ and $M\approx 10^{-3} \,\mathrm{g}$. They are not suitable dark matter candidates as they will decay into standard model particles if they have additional couplings\footnote{In the case of coupling to photons, oscillons could decay in electromagnetic radiation \cite{Levkov:2020txo,Chung-Jukko:2023cow}.}. However, they can leave an observational imprint on the stochastic background of gravitational waves during their formation process and subsequent evolution. We have observed that this can appear rather chaotic, with some oscillons fragmenting into multiple objects. Naively, we expect the radiation from such processes to increase with the compactness of oscillons, as was observed in the context of oscillaton collisions \cite{Helfer:2018vtq}, but we leave a systematic study of the precise gravitational-wave spectrum for future work.

\section{A worked example \label{sec:example}}
 
 To illustrate the results obtained so far, we will discuss an explicit parameter example in this section. The most natural scalar potential for an axion is a periodic potential, breaking the shift symmetry of the axion down to a discrete symmetry due to non-perturbative effects,
 \begin{equation}
  V = V_0 \left[1 - \cos\left( \frac{\phi}{f_\phi} \right) \right] \simeq \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4 \,.
  \label{eq:ScalarPotential}
 \end{equation}
In the following we will take $m = 7.5 \times 10^{-6}~M_P$ and $\lambda = 1.1 \times 10^{-13}$ (corresponding to $V_0^{1/4} 
\simeq 8.3 \times 10^{-3}~M_P$ and $f_\phi \simeq 9.2~M_P$). This parameter choice ensures the correct normalization of the scalar power spectrum at CMB scales as well as a tensor-to-scalar ratio in agreement with the Planck data~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}.\footnote{We note that natural inflation, described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalarPotential} is in some tension with the latest Planck data. For our purposes, the precise form of the potential is not relevant, so we stick with Eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalarPotential} for simpicity. For a discussion of the impact of different types of scalar potentials in abelian axion inflation, see Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}.} 
The remaining parameters are then the gauge-field inflaton coupling $\alpha/\Lambda$ which directly controls the size of the parameter $\xi$ and the gauge coupling $e$. In the following we choose $\alpha/\Lambda = 30$ and $e = 5 \times 10^{-3}$. This parameter choice places the matching point between the abelian and the non-abelian regime within the observable last 55 e-folds of inflation while keeping a safe distance from the CMB scales. It serves to illustrate the main results as well as the difficulties encountered in a concrete realization of emerging chromo-natural inflation. A generalization of this setup is briefly discussed at the end of Subsection~\ref{subsec:gaugefluctuations}.
 
 The discussion in this section is organized as follows. In Subsection~\ref{subsec:gaugefluctuations} we will discuss the growth of the gauge field fluctuations with particular emphasis on the tachyonic modes as well as their backreaction on the homogeneous background field. Upon determining the range of validity of our linearized approach, we turn to the scalar and tensor power spectra in Subsection~\ref{subsec:powerspectra}.
 
 \subsection{Growth of gauge field fluctutions \label{subsec:gaugefluctuations}}
 
We first recall some key results about the homogeneous background evolution and the gauge field fluctuations from the previous sections:
\begin{itemize}

\item In single field inflation models, and in particular for the scalar potential considered here, the inflaton velocity $\dot \phi$ and hence the parameter $\xi$ increases during inflation.
 
 \item In the far past, when $\xi<2$, the only stable solution for a classical isotropic gauge field background is the zero solution. General solutions are described by small perturbations around the zero solution.
 
  \item As long as the homogeneous background  is sufficiently small, three of the six gauge field modes are tachyonically enhanced, corresponding to three copies of the abelian limit described in Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:TensorModeEvolution}). In this abelian limit, the variance  $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2}$ grows exponentially with $\xi$ and is well described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}.  

  \item When $\xi > 2$, a stable, non-zero background solution develops (see Sec.~\ref{sec:background}).  We refer to this second solution as the ``$c_2$-solution.'' It becomes possible that at some point, large fluctuations arising from the tachyonically enhanced modes will push the background away from the zero solution and towards the $c_2$-solution. 
 
  \item The transition from an approximately-zero homogeneous background field to the $c_2$-solution occurs once the fluctuations become large enough to trigger the $c_2$-solution, $ e \langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2} \sim \xi / (- \tau)$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:transition-time}.\footnote{Eq.~\eqref{eq:BoundaryOscillatory} marks the boundary to the oscillatory regime, from where $c_i$-type solutions spiral inwards to their asymptotic $c_i$ values. As Fig.~\ref{fig:u0-of-xi} illustrated, for sufficiently large $\xi$ the $c_2$ solution becomes overwhelmingly likely. In the unlikely event that the classical background begins to evolve towards a $c_0$ solution, the gauge field background would be continued to be dominated by $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2}$, growing according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian}. The resulting stochastic initial conditions will eventually trigger a $c_2$-type background. Numerically, the condition $ e \langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2} \sim \xi / (- \tau)$ is basically equivalent to requiring that the magnitude of the fluctuations be of the same order as the $c_2$ solution and very similar to the requirement of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Conditionabelian}. This `matching condition' is conservative in the sense that even smaller fluctuations which reach the  $c_1$ saddle point solution (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:phase-space}) could (classically) evolve towards the $c_2$-solution. This is depicted by the dotted blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:matching}. } This is depicted by the solid black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:matching}.

  \item As the background grows, we enter the non-abelian regime.  In this regime, the background field evolves towards the isotropic $c_2$-solution where only the helicity $+2$-mode is enhanced.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width = 0.6 \textwidth]{matching.pdf}
 \caption{Values of $\xi$ required to match the abelian and non-abelian regime as a function of the gauge coupling $e$. The horizontal and vertical gray lines indicate the parameter point used in this section. {For reference, the dashed gray lines indicate modified matching conditions, $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2} = {\cal N} \xi /(- \tau e)$ with ${\cal N} = \{1/3, 3 \}$ parametrizing the theoretical uncertainties in the matching condition, see text. The dotted blue line indicates where $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2}$ can reach the unstable $c_1$ background solution  (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:phase-space}). }}
 \label{fig:matching}
\end{figure}

Based on these observations, our strategy will be the following: (i) As long as the abelian variance $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2}$ as given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian} is much smaller than $\xi /(- \tau e)$ we work in the abelian limit with $f(\tau) = 0$. (ii) When $\langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2} \simeq \xi /(- \tau e)$ we take $f(\tau)$ to be given by the $c_2$-solution~\eqref{eq:c2solution}. We match $\phi(\tau)$ and $\phi'(\tau)$ at this point, but turning on the term on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion} will cause a discontinuity in $\phi''(\tau)$.\footnote{In the abelian regime, the corresponding term is given by the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_motion} after inserting Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_EB}. For the parameter point discussed in this section, this is about a factor 10 smaller than the non-abelian expression at the matching point.} We ensure that for the parameter point we consider this term is sub-dominant, so as to limit any unphysical effects here. (iii) We compute the evolution of all degrees of freedom in this background, tracking each mode from the sub- to the super-horizon regime. Note that for smaller values of the gauge coupling, the transition from the abelian to the non-abelian regime at $ e \langle A_\text{ab}^2 \rangle^{1/2} = \, \xi/(- \tau)$ requires larger values of $\xi$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:matching}.

Several comments are in order. Firstly, our matching procedure from the abelian to the non-abelian regime should be seen as a rough order-of-magnitude estimate only, and the results for the evolution of the background and of the fluctuations in this transition regime should be treated with care accordingly. Secondly, the linearization we are using is justified~\footnote{Notice that this is the same criterion adopted in~\cite{Adshead:2016omu} . In particular Eq.~\eqref{eq:estimate-variance} is equivalent to Eq.(7.6) of~\cite{Adshead:2016omu} .} as long as $\langle \delta A^2 \rangle^{1/2} \ll f(\tau)$. Once the growth of the $e_{+2}$ mode overcomes the background evolution, a different treatment of the gauge field background becomes necessary, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution}, we depict the evolution of the homogeneous inflaton background in the abelian (solid black curve) and in the non-abelian regime (solid orange curve), obtained by numerically solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground} with $f(\tau)$ set to 0 and to $c_2 \, \xi/(- e \tau)$ in the two regimes, respectively. The matching point $\langle A^2_\text{ab} \rangle^{1/2} = c_2 \, \xi/(- e \tau)$ is indicated by the horizontal and vertical gray lines. For reference, we also show the evolution in the absence of the inflaton - gauge field coupling (dashed blue curve). The x-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution} is labeled in e-folds, $dN = - H dt$, where we use the convention that inflation ends at $N = 0$ and the CMB scales exit the horizon at $N \simeq 55$.




{The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution} shows the velocity of $\phi$, encoded by the parameter $\xi$. After the matching, the velocity drops abruptly, since turning on the background gauge field enhances the gauge-field induced term in the inflaton equation of motion. {The details are sensitive to the matching procedure we invoke, and for our computations of the scalar and tensor power spectra in Sec.~\ref{subsec:powerspectra} we will therefore exclude a few e-folds around this transition regime.}

More importantly, after this transition regime the last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground} in only proportional to $\xi^3$ instead of being  exponentially sensitive to $\xi$ as in the abelian regime (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:rev_EB}). Consequently, the dominant terms in the equation for $\phi$ in this regime are the second and third term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:phibackground}, and, similar to the situation in the absence of the gauge field - inflaton coupling, $\xi \propto \sqrt{\varepsilon} \propto 1/\sqrt{N}$~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh} (see also Sec.~\ref{subsec:dynamical_background}). This in particular implies that in this regime we are not in the `magnetic drift regime' studied in \cite{Adshead:2013nka}, which is characterized by the gauge friction dominating over the Hubble friction. }




Next we consider the evolution of the gauge field fluctuations in this background. From the discussion in the previous section, we know that the helicity $+2$ mode captures the enhancement both in the abelian and in the non-abelian regime. For simplicity, we will restrict our discussion here to this mode, however we have checked numerically that including the full system does not lead to any significant changes. In de Sitter space, any mode with co-moving momentum $k$ exits the horizon at $k = a H = - x/\tau$, where to good approximation $3 H^2 M_P^2 = V(\phi)$. Setting $a = 1$ at the end of inflation, this implies that at e-fold $N$, the mode $k_N = \exp(-N) H$ exits the horizon. In Fig.~\ref{fig:modes-evolution} we show the evolution of six modes which exit the horizon in the abelian regime (left panel) and in the non-abelian regime (right panel). The gradual change within each panel is due to the evolving background, i.e.\ the slow increase of $\xi$.

In both panels, $k$ increases (i.e.\ the value of $N$ labelling the horizon exit decreases) from purple to blue. Parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution}.}
  \label{fig:modes-evolution}
\end{figure}


Since the change of $\xi$ is slow, we can estimate the variance of these fluctuations by {(see Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian})}
{ \begin{equation}
 \langle \delta A^2 \rangle_N = \int \frac{\textrm{d}^3 \vec{k}}{(2 \pi)^3 } \frac{1}{2 k} | w_{+2}^{(e)}\left(k, 
 \tau(N) \right) |^2  \simeq \frac{1}{\left(- \tau(N)\right)^2} \int \frac{x \,  \textrm{d}x}{4 \pi^2} | w_{+2,N}^{(e)}(x) |^2 \,,
 \label{eq:estimate-variance}
\end{equation} 
where $w_{+2,N}$ indicates the mode function of the wave vector $k_N$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:modes-evolution}), which we use to approximate the full mode function at the e-fold $N$. } In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:variance} we show the resulting variance (green dots), together with the homogeneous background solution $f(\tau)$ (solid blue). In the abelian regime, the semi-analytical expression Eq.~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian} (shown as a dashed green line) gives a good approximation over most of this regime. {The deviation at large $N$ simply reflects that our fitting formula~\eqref{eq:variance_abelian} is not optimized for very small values of $\xi$,} 
whereas the deviations a few e-folds before the matching point reflect that the super-horizon parts of these modes are affected by the non-abelian regime, which leads to a suppression of the variance. In the following analysis we will exclude the modes which exit the horizon within 3 e-folds before or after the matching point, so as to minimize artifacts introduced by the specific matching procedure. To illustrate the uncertainties involved, the gray curves indicate the variance we obtain in the transition region with the matching procedure above (dashed gray curve) and by imposing the matching at a later point (dotted gray curve), as indicated by the vertical dashed line.


In the non-abelian regime, the fluctuations are initially suppressed compared to the abelian case, due to a combination of two effects: { Firstly, as is evident from Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution}, the parameter $\xi$, which controls the tachyonic instability in the helicity $+2$ gauge field mode, initially drops after switching on the background gauge field. Secondly, in the non-abelian regime the variance grows more slowly as a function of $\xi$, c.f.\ right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:variance}.} The smallness of $\langle \delta A^2 \rangle$ compared to its counterpart in the abelian regime and compared to the classical background $f(\tau)$ is a crucial ingredient in justifying the ansatz of a linearized analysis around a homogeneous background field in the non-abelian regime. In the parameter example at hand, the non-Abelian fluctuations are at best mildly suppressed compared to the homogeneous background, implying significant uncertainties in our analysis of the non-abelian regime for this parameter point. The situation improves for smaller gauge - inflaton couplings $\alpha/\Lambda$ and for smaller gauge couplings $e$. In particular, we note the gauge friction dominated regime of CNI is free from this problem~\cite{Adshead:2016omu}. However, in these cases the systematic uncertainties associated with the matching procedure tend to be larger. Given these limitations, we refrain from tweaking the parameter point discussed here, emphasizing that its purpose is to illustrate our main line of thought as well as the encountered obstacles, leaving a more detailed investigation of the parameter space to future works. 

Once the fluctuations reach values close to the background field we cannot trust our treatment anymore, since the motion of the background field is now no longer determined by its classical motion.\footnote{We note that the perturbativity criterion employed in~\cite{Caldwell:2017chz} (see also~\cite{Adshead:2016omu,Adshead:2017hnc}), which measures the fluctuations per logarithmic frequency interval, $(\tfrac{\textrm{d} }{\textrm{d} \ln k} \langle \delta A^2 \rangle^{1/2})/f$ is less restrictive. This quantity does not exceed the percent level in the entire regime depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:variance}. This may indicate the possibility of pushing the linearized analysis somewhat further than  the conservative cut-off implemented in this analysis. Moreover, we are somewhat overestimating the variance in Eq.~\eqref{eq:estimate-variance}, since we are integrating over the super-horizon part of the mode $ w_{+2, k_N}^{(e)}(\tau)$, whereas we should be taking the super-horizon contributions of the modes which crossed the horizon accordingly earlier, at correspondingly smaller $\xi$. } 
This regime calls for a dedicated lattice simulation to capture the non-linear effects, which is beyond the scope of this work.

\end{figure}

The results in this section were obtained for the parameter choice given below Eq.~\eqref{eq:ScalarPotential}. The parameters of the scalar potential, $m$ and $\lambda$, are directly related to the CMB observables and do not impact the discussion of this section much. On the other hand, the coupling parameters $\alpha/\Lambda$ and $e$ are crucial for our discussion. Increasing $\alpha/\Lambda$ increases $\xi$ at the CMB scales and consequently leads to an earlier transition to the non-abelian regime. Current observations constrain $\xi_\text{CMB} \lesssim 2.5$ in the contest of abelian axion inflation~\cite{Barnaby:2011qe}. Increasing the gauge coupling $e$ leads to a lower threshold of $\xi$ to trigger the non-vanishing gauge field background, see Fig.~\ref{fig:matching}. Correspondingly, the transition happens earlier and also more smoothly, since the gauge field source term in the inflaton equation of motion~\eqref{eq:phibackground}, proportional to $\xi^3/e^2$ when inserting the $c_2$-solution, is less important.

 

 
\subsection{Scalar and tensor power spectra \label{subsec:powerspectra}}

We now turn to the scalar and tensor power spectra of the benchmark model of the previous subsection, the key observables of any inflation model (for a review, see~\cite{Baumann:2009ds}):
\begin{align}
 \langle \zeta_{\vec k} \zeta_{\vec k}' \rangle & = (2 \pi)^3 \delta (\vec k + \vec k') {\cal P}_\zeta(k)  \,, \\
 \langle h_{\vec k}^\lambda h_{\vec k'}^{\lambda'} \rangle & = (2 \pi)^3 \delta (\vec k + \vec k') \delta_{\lambda \lambda'} {\cal P}_{h^\lambda}(k)  \,.
\end{align}
Identifying the Mukhanov variables which are canonically normalized on far sub-horizon scales as $v^\zeta = (a \, \delta \phi)$ and $v^h = (a \gamma)$ for scalars and tensors, respectively, the power spectra read
\begin{align}
  {\cal P}_\zeta(k) & =  \left( \frac{H}{\dot \phi} \right)^2 \left(\frac{|v^\zeta_k(x)|}{a}\right)^2 \,, \\
  {\cal P}_{h^\lambda}(k) & =  \left( \frac{2}{M_P} \right)^2 \left(\frac{|v^h_k(x)|}{a}\right)^2 \,,
\end{align}
where $\zeta$ denotes the gauge invariant curvature perturbation and $\lambda$ denotes the helicity of the gravitational wave $h^\lambda$.
Due to the freeze-out of $(a \delta \phi)$ and $(a \gamma)$ on super-horizon scales (see Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc}), it suffices to evaluate these power spectra at horizon crossing $(x = 1)$. Since at this point in time the coupling to the gauge fields can be very relevant, we perform this task numerically, solving the mode equations Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullscalar} and \eqref{eq:fulltensor} in the evolving background discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:example}.

Recalling that $ v_k^{\zeta,h}(x)$ is a function of $x$ only, it is convenient to introduce
\begin{equation}
 \Delta_s^2 = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} {\cal P}_\zeta(k) \,, \qquad  (\Delta_t^\lambda)^2 = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} {\cal P}_{h^\lambda}(k) \,,
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align}
 \Delta_s^2 & = \left( \frac{H_*}{2 \pi_*}\right)^2 \left( \frac{H_*}{\dot \phi_*}\right)^2  \left(  x \, |w^{(\phi)}_0(x)| \right)^2 \bigg|_{x \ll 1}  \,, \label{eq:Ds}\\
 (\Delta_t^\pm)^2 & = \left( \frac{H_*}{2 \pi}\right)^2 \left( \frac{2}{M_P}\right)^2  \left(  x \, |w^{(\gamma)}_{\pm2}(x)| \right)^2 \bigg|_{x \ll 1}  \,, \label{eq:Dt}
\end{align}
where $H_*$ and $\dot \phi_*$ denote the Hubble parameter and inflaton velocity at the point in time when the mode in question crosses the horizon $(x = 1)$. To ensure that we are fully in the freeze-out regime, the last parenthesis in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:Ds} and \eqref{eq:Dt} is evaluated at $x = 0.1$. We emphasize that the numerical evaluation of the scalar and tensor power spectrum presented below should be taken with a grain of salt, due to the lack of a clear hierarchy between the gauge field background and its fluctuations in the non-abelian regime for this particular parameter point. In other parts of the parameter space, where this problem does not arise, the analysis below applies without this caveat.  


\subsubsection{Scalar power spectrum \label{subsec:PS}}

The scalar power spectrum computed in this way is subject to the caveat described around Eq.~\eqref{eq:caveat}:  to linear order in $\delta A$, it is sourced only by helicity zero objects, including the helicity zero gauge field fluctuations. However at ${\cal O}(\delta A^2)$, the helicity $+2$ gauge fluctuations contribute too, and due to their strong enhancement, can become the dominant source.
Generalizing the procedure of Ref.~\cite{Linde:2012bt} (see also \cite{Barnaby:2011qe}) to the non-abelian case, we can obtain an estimate for the full scalar power spectrum including this second order contribution. For simplicity, let us consider only the  helicity 0 mode associated with $\delta \phi$, whose coupling to $\langle F \tilde F \rangle$ in the action contains a coupling to two enhanced helicity $+2$ gauge field modes. In real space, the equation of motion for $\delta \phi$ reads,
\begin{equation}
 \ddot{\delta \phi} + 3 H \dot{\delta \phi} - \frac{\nabla^2}{a^2} \delta \phi + m_{\phi \phi}^2 \delta \phi = - \frac{\alpha}{4 \Lambda} \delta(\langle F \tilde F \rangle) \,,
 \label{eq:dphiRealSpace}
\end{equation}
where we have neglected here the couplings to the helicity 0 gauge field modes, which are discussed in depth in Sec.~\ref{sec:AllFluc}. The right-hand side is the variation of the Chern-Simons term with respect to the average value entering in the 0th order equation, taking also into account the $\dot \phi$-dependence of $\langle F \tilde F\rangle$ through the parameter $\xi$,
\begin{align}
 \delta (\langle F \tilde F \rangle ) & = [F \tilde F - \langle F \tilde F \rangle ]_{\delta \phi = 0} + \frac{\partial \langle F \tilde F \rangle }{\partial \dot \phi} \dot{\delta \phi} \,. 
\end{align}
As demonstrated in App.~\ref{app:variance_computation}, this can be re-expressed as 
\begin{align}
 \delta (\langle F \tilde F \rangle ) = \frac{H^4}{ \pi^2} e^{2 \pi(\kappa - \mu)} \left[  \left(\frac{ \tilde T_1 + \tilde T_2}{5} \right)^{1/2} + \frac{  2 \pi \alpha (\kappa - \mu ) }{2 \Lambda  \xi} \,  \tilde T_0  \, \delta \phi\right] \,.
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
\tilde T_1 = 0.0082 \cdot \xi^8   \,, \quad \tilde T_2 = 0.051 \cdot  \xi^6   \,, \quad \tilde T_0 = - 0.24 \cdot  \xi^3\,,
\end{align}
where $\kappa$ and $\mu$ are defined below Eq.~\eqref{eq:whittakeragain}. At horizon crossing the first and third term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphiRealSpace} cancel. Moreover, neglecting the slow-roll suppressed term proportional to $m_{\phi \phi}^2$ and using $\dot{\delta \phi} \simeq H \delta \phi$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
 \delta \phi \simeq - \frac{\alpha}{12 \Lambda H^2} \delta(\langle F \tilde F \rangle) \simeq \frac{- \frac{e^{2 \pi(\kappa - \mu)}}{{12} \pi^2} \frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} H^2 \sqrt{\frac{\tilde T_1 + \tilde T_2}{5}}}{1 + \frac{e^{2 \pi(\kappa - \mu)}}{24 \pi^2} \left(\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda} \right)^2  \frac{2 \pi (\kappa - \mu )}{\xi} H^2 \tilde T_0} \,.
 \label{eq:deltaphi_2nd}
\end{equation}
Note that for sufficiently large $\xi$, when the right-hand side dominates Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphiRealSpace} simply becomes
\begin{equation}
 \delta \phi \simeq \frac{-2 \xi \Lambda}{ 2 \pi \alpha (\kappa - \mu )} \left( \frac{\tilde T_1 + \tilde T_2}{5} \right)^{1/2} \frac{1}{\tilde T_0 } \,.
\end{equation}
More generally, the two limiting cases of Eq.~\eqref{eq:deltaphi_2nd} are
\begin{align}
 \left(\Delta_s^2\right)^\text{2nd} & \sim \left( \frac{H}{\dot \phi} \delta \phi \right)^2   \simeq \begin{cases}
    \left( \frac{\alpha H}{2 \pi \Lambda} \right)^4  \frac{\tilde T_1 + \tilde T_2}{180 \, \xi^2}  e^{4 \pi(\kappa - \mu)}
     &\qquad  \text{for     } \xi^3 e^{2 \pi(\kappa - \mu)} \ll 270  \left( \frac{\Lambda}{\alpha H}\right)^2    \label{eq:Ds_2nd} \\
  \frac{\tilde T_1 + \tilde T_2}{5 \, \tilde T_0^2}   \left[2 \pi (\kappa - \mu )\right]^{-2}   &\qquad \text{for    } \xi^3 e^{2 \pi(\kappa - \mu)} \gg 270  \left( \frac{\Lambda}{\alpha H}\right)^2  
   \end{cases} \,.
\end{align}

\begin{figure}

Same parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution}.}
 \label{fig:spectraPS}
\end{figure}

We note that initially, for small values of $\xi$, this grows as $\exp[4 \pi (\kappa - \mu)] \simeq \exp[4 \pi \xi (2 - \sqrt{2})]$ whereas for large values of $\xi$ we find the same $1/\xi^2$ dependence as in the abelian case~\cite{Linde:2012bt}. The total scalar power spectrum is the sum of the vacuum contribution~\eqref{eq:Ds} and the contribution sourced by the enhanced gauge field mode~\eqref{eq:Ds_2nd}.\footnote{{As this work was being finalized, Refs.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2018xnn,Papageorgiou:2018rfx} appeared, which also consider these nonlinear couplings. The main focus of Ref.~\cite{Dimastrogiovanni:2018xnn} is the three-point correlators between the scalar and tensor perturbations, whereas Ref.~\cite{Papageorgiou:2018rfx} is a dedicated study of the leading nonlinear contribution to the scalar power spectrum.  A direct comparison of our results is difficult due to the different background evolution (see discussion in Sec.~\ref{subsec:dynamical_background}) and due to the fact that in our parameter space we typically encounter larger values of $\xi$ than encountered in \cite{Papageorgiou:2018rfx}. Using a very different methodology than presented here, Ref.~\cite{Papageorgiou:2018rfx} concludes that the non-linear contributions to the scalar power spectrum begin to dominate over the vacuum contributions at  $m_Q \simeq 2.7$, where  $m_Q \simeq c_2 \, \xi$, {and hence $\xi (m_Q = 2.7) \simeq 3$. From Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ds_2nd}, we can estimate that in our analysis, the non-linear term comes to dominate at $\xi \simeq 2.5$.   Moreover, the exponential sensitivity on $\xi$, $\Delta_s^2 \sim e^{2 \pi m_Q}$ in \cite{Papageorgiou:2018rfx}, is similar to what we find here. 
Within the uncertainties inherent to both methods, we consider this a  good agreement.}  For related work in the abelian case see also Refs.~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf,Barnaby:2011vw}.}

} In  Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraPS}, we show the resulting estimate for scalar spectrum in the non-abelian regime (dotted orange). The `strong backreaction regime', where the simplified expression in the second line of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ds_2nd} applies is reached only around $N \simeq 10$. For reference, we show also corresponding estimate in the abelian regime (dashed blue)~\cite{Linde:2012bt},
\begin{align}
 (\Delta_s^2)_\text{ab.}  = (\Delta_s^2)_\text{vac} +  (\Delta_s^2)_\text{gauge} = \left( \frac{H^2}{2 \pi \dot \phi}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{ \alpha \langle \vec E \vec B \rangle}{2 \beta \Lambda H \dot \phi} \right)^2 \,, 
\end{align}
with
\begin{equation}
 \beta = 1 - 2 \pi \xi \frac{\alpha \langle \vec E \vec B \rangle}{3 \Lambda H \dot \phi} \,, \quad  \langle \vec E \vec B \rangle = - 2.0 \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{H^4}{\xi^4} e^{2 \pi \xi} \,,
\end{equation}
as well as  the standard vacuum contribution (solid gray line, obtained by setting the last parenthesis in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ds} to 1), which agrees well with the results obtained from the linearized analysis. The horizontal gray line indicates the observed value at the CMB scales. 


\subsubsection{Gravitational wave spectrum \label{subsec:TS}}
Next we turn to the tensor power spectrum. For the purpose of direct gravitational wave searches (Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and interferometers), it is customary to express the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) as the energy in gravitational waves per logarithmic frequency interval normalized to the critical energy density~$\rho_c$ \cite{Turner:1993vb,Seto:2003kc,Smith:2005mm}, 
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_{\rm GW}(k) = \frac{1}{\rho_c} \frac{\partial \rho_{GW}(k)}{\partial \ln k}  = \frac{(\Delta_t^+)^2 + (\Delta_t^-)^2}{24} \Omega_r \frac{g_*^k}{g_*^0} \left( \frac{g_{*,s}^0}{g_{*,s}^k} \right)^{4/3} \,,
\end{equation}
for modes entering during the radiation dominated epoch of the universe, where $g_*^{k,0}$ ($g_{*,s}^{k,0}$) denotes the effective number of degrees of freedom contributing to the energy (entropy) of the thermal bath at the point in time when the mode $k$ entered the horizon and today, respectively. $\Omega_r = 8.5 \times 10^{-5}$ denotes the fraction of radiation energy today. Neglecting the change in the number of degrees of freedom, this leads to
\begin{align}
 \Omega_{\rm GW}(k) & = \frac{\Omega_r}{24} \left( \frac{H}{2 \pi}\right)^2 \left( \frac{2}{M_P}\right)^2 \left[  \left(  x \, |w^{(\gamma)}_{-2}(x)| \right)^2  +  \left( x \, |w^{(\gamma)}_{+2}(x)| \right)^2 \right]\bigg|_{x = 1}  \\
 & = \frac{\Omega_r}{24} \left( \frac{H}{2 \pi}\right)^2 \left( \frac{2}{M_P}\right)^2 \left[  \left( 1  +  x \, |w^{(\gamma)}_{+2}(x)| \right)^2 \right]\bigg|_{x = 1}  \,,
 \label{eq:OmegaGW} 
\end{align}
where we have made use of the observation that the $w_{-2}^{(\gamma)}$ mode is not enhanced and hence is given by the usual solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, $w_{-2}^{(\gamma)}(x = 1) = 1 $.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{GWs_plot.pdf}
\caption{Stochastic gravitational wave background. Our semi-analytical estimate~\eqref{eq:GWapprox} in the non-abelian regime  is shown as dotted orange line. For reference, we show the standard contribution of the vacuum fluctuations (solid gray)and the (non-linear) contribution in the abelian regime (dashed blue). The results of the linearized analysis are shown as green dots. Same parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi-evolution}.}
 \label{fig:spectraGW}
\end{figure}


In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraGW} we show the resulting  SGWB compared to current and upcoming experimental constraints from pulsar timing arrays~\cite{vanHaasteren:2011ni,Kramer:2004rwa} and from the interferometer experiments LIGO~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016wyq}, LISA~\cite{Audley:2017drz} and the Einstein Telescope~\cite{ET}. For reference, we also show the standard vacuum solution (in gray), obtained by setting $  w^{(\gamma, \phi)}(x = 1) = 1$, as well as the analytical results from the abelian regime (dashed blue line),
\begin{align}
 (\Omega_{\rm GW})_\text{ab.}  = \frac{1}{24} \Omega_r \left( \frac{H}{\pi M_P} \right)^2 \left( 2 + 4.3 \cdot 10^{-7} \frac{2 H^2}{M_P^2} \frac{e^{4 \pi \xi}}{\xi^6}\right) \,.
 \label{eq:GWab}
\end{align}
 {A key feature of the non-abelian regime is that the gravitational waves couple to the enhanced gauge-field mode at the linear level, resulting in the enhanced SGWB at large frequencies~\cite{Adshead:2013nka}. In the abelian regime, such a source term is absent at the linear level and only appears at the non-linear level. This is simply because the energy-momentum tensor, the source term of the GW equation of motion, is bi-linear in the gauge fields and we do not have a background gauge field in the abelian regime. This non-linear term is of course not captured by the linearized analysis performed here, and hence we simply include the non-linear contribution in the abelian regime given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWab} a posteriori. Note that in the non-abelian regime this non-linear contribution is sub-dominant as long as $\delta A \ll f$. For the parameter point studied here, we find the SGWB to be out of reach of the GW interferometers LIGO and LISA, and barely reachable with the Einstein Telescope. However we stress that a different parameter choice, leading e.g.\ to an earlier matching between the abelian and non-abelian regime, could change this picture. A full-fledged study of the parameter space is beyond the scope of the current paper. We note that as in Ref.~\cite{Agrawal:2017awz}, we expect this gravitational wave background to be very non-gaussian, which may be used as a powerful model discriminator in future observations~\cite{Bartolo:2018qqn}.



Combining Eqs.~\eqref{eq:GWanalytical} and \eqref{eq:OmegaGW} we can obtain an analytical estimate of the SGWB in the non-abelian regime,
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq \frac{1}{24} \Omega_r \left( \frac{\xi^3 H}{\pi M_P} \right)^2_{\xi = \xi_\text{cr}}  \left( \frac{2^{7/4} H}{e} \xi^{-1/2} e^{(2 - \sqrt{2}) \pi \xi}  \right)^2_{\xi = \xi_\text{ref}} \,.
 \label{eq:GWapprox}
\end{equation}
Here, to take into account the variation of $\xi$, we evaluate the first parenthesis (related to the GW - gauge field coupling at horizon crossing) at $\xi_\text{cr} = \xi(x = 1)$, whereas we evaluate the second parenthesis (describing the helicity $+2$ gauge field solution) at a the reference value $x = (2 + \sqrt{2}) \xi_\text{cr}$ roughly corresponding to the onset of the instability in the gauge field mode. The resulting estimate for the GW spectrum is depicted by the dotted orange line in  Fig.~\ref{fig:spectraGW}. The discrepancy to the numerical result can be traced back to Eq.~\eqref{eq:GWanalytical}, which overestimates the GW amplitude by about a factor of three.}


In summary, we reproduce the vacuum contribution for both the scalar and tensor power spectrum at large $N$,  thus ensuring agreement with all CMB observations. As we approach smaller scales, we observe an enhancement of both spectra as we pass first through the abelian and then through the non-abelian regime. For the specific parameter point studied in this section, the effects seem out of reach of current and upcoming experiments, though a more careful analysis is required to correctly account for the uncertainties due the lack of hierarchy between the gauge field background and its fluctuations. We generically expect larger signals with increasing $\alpha/\Lambda$ and/or increasing gauge coupling, see discussion at the end of Sec.~\ref{subsec:gaugefluctuations}. This part of the parameter space however comes with even larger gauge field fluctuations, requiring a different computational strategy to even reliably describe the background evolution in this regime.

\begin{abstract}
The shift-symmetric coupling of a pseudo-scalar particle driving inflation to gauge fields provides a unique way of probing cosmic inflation. For the case of an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge group, we suggest a possible mechanism for the development of a classical isotropic background gauge field from the standard quantum mechanical vacuum in the far past. Over the course of inflation, the theory dynamically evolves from an approximately abelian regime into an inherently non-abelian regime, with distinct predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra. The latter regime closely resembles a setup known as chromo-natural inflation, although our main focus here is on a new part of the parameter space which has received little attention so far. For single-field slow-roll inflation models, large scales may exit the horizon in the abelian regime, ensuring agreement with the observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, whereas smaller scales experience the non-abelian effects. This results in a strong enhancement of the stochastic gravitational wave background at small scales,  e.g.\ at frequencies accessible with ground-based interferometers. For the scalar power spectrum, a similar enhancement arises due to non-linear contributions.

The recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by a black hole (BH) binary by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration~\cite{Abbott:2016blz} marked not only the beginning of a new age of GW astronomy but can also be seen as the first direct evidence of BHs. With a lot more data from advanced LIGO/VIRGO and from the future space-mission LISA~\cite{LISA} on the horizon, these are exciting times for considering possible implications for fundamental physics and early universe cosmology. 

Prompted by the LIGO discovery and the lack of positive results in dedicated dark matter searches, the idea that primordial black holes (PBHs) could be (a fraction of) dark matter has recently received a lot of attention~\cite{Bird:2016dcv, Clesse:2016vqa,Sasaki:2016jop,Carr:2016drx,Clesse:2016ajp,Blinnikov:2016bxu,Garcia-Bellido:2017fdg,Georg:2017mqk}. PBHs are formed when local over densities collapse due to their gravitational instability. Here we will focus on the possibility that these local over densities are sourced by the primordial scalar power spectrum of inflation (see e.g.\ Refs.~\cite{Cotner:2016cvr,Davoudiasl:2016mwf } for other recently discussed possibilities). This requires an amplitude of the scalar power spectrum which is much larger than the amplitude observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), i.e.\ a highly blue spectrum. On the other hand, PBHs formed at very small scales are strongly constrained by the traces their decays leave in the CMB and in the extra-galactic gamma ray background~\cite{Carr:2009jm}. A viable model of PBH dark matter thus requires a non-trivial peaked structure of the primordial scalar power spectrum. It has been demonstrated that such spectra can be achieved in multifield models of inflation~\cite{GarciaBellido:1996qt,Lyth:2011kj,Bugaev:2011wy,Clesse:2015wea,Kohri:2012yw,Kawasaki:2012wr,Bugaev:2013vba,Inomata:2017okj,Inomata:2016rbd,Kawasaki:2016pql} or by arranging for the corresponding features in the scalar potential of inflation~\cite{Cheng:2016qzb,Garcia-Bellido:2017mdw,Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw}.

In this paper, we generate PBH dark matter in an inflation model which is based on two simple, generic features: an axion-like inflaton with a non-minimal coupling to gravity which increases towards the end of inflation. Axion-like particles are interesting inflaton candidates for several reasons: (i)~their approximate shift-symmetry protects them from large mass contributions, preserving the required slow-roll phase of inflation. (ii)~they appear abundantly in supergravity as part of complex scalars as well as in string theory~\cite{0605206}, where they typically arise upon compactification of form field gauge potentials. (iii)~they generically couple to the topological Chern-Simons term of any gauge group, leading to a wide range of potentially observable effects~\cite{Turner:1987bw, Garretson:1992vt, Anber:2006xt,Barnaby:2011qe}. These include a non-Gaussian and blue contribution to the scalar spectrum, potentially leading to PBH formation~\cite{Barnaby:2010vf,Linde:2012bt,Lin:2012gs,Meerburg:2012id,Bugaev:2013fya,Garcia-Bellido:2016dkw} as well as a blue, non-Gaussian and highly polarized stochastic GW spectrum, potentially observable by LIGO or LISA~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Anber:2012du,Bartolo:2016ami}.

The predictions for different universality classes of pseudoscalar inflation have recently been studied in Ref.~\cite{Domcke:2016bkh}. Here we extend this work by allowing for a non-minimal coupling to gravity, i.e.\ by considering simple Jordan frame inflation models. In recent years, such a setup was found to be appealing both for deriving the supergravity Lagrangian~\cite{Kallosh:2000ve} and from a phenomenological perspective, driven most notably by the discussion of Higgs inflation~\cite{Bezrukov:2007ep}. Such a non-minimal coupling to gravity is a characteristic feature of supergravity in the Jordan frame~\cite{Kallosh:2013hoa,Kallosh:2013tua,Ferrara:2013rsa,Galante:2014ifa,Broy:2015qna,Das:2016kwz}. The so-called attractor models at strong coupling~\cite{Kallosh:2013tua,Kallosh:2013yoa} are an example of how the non-minimal coupling to gravity can be used to construct classes of models which asymptote to the sweet spot of the Planck data, see also~\cite{Einhorn:2009bh,Ferrara:2010yw,Buchmuller:2013zfa,Giudice:2014toa,Pallis:2013yda,Pallis:2014dma,Pallis:2014boa,Ellis:2013xoa,Kallosh:2013xya,Nakayama:2010ga,Pieroni:2015cma} for other implementations.


Combining these two ingredients, the following picture emerges: at large scales (constrained by CMB observations~\cite{Ade:2015lrj}), i.e.\ early on in the inflationary epoch, both the coupling to the Chern-Simons term and the non-minimal coupling to gravity are suppressed. As inflation proceeds, the former generically induces a tachyonic instability in the equation of motion for the gauge fields, leading to a gauge-field background which in turn acts as an additional, classical source term for scalar and tensor perturbations. This results in a strong increase of both spectra. Once the gauge field production has reached a critical value, the back-reaction of the gauge fields on the inflaton dynamics slows the growth of both spectra~\cite{Anber:2009ua,Barnaby:2011qe,Barnaby:2011vw}. Finally, in the last stage of inflation the non-minimal coupling to gravity becomes relevant and both the scalar and tensor spectrum are suppressed. As a result, a significant fraction of dark matter (for specific parameter choices even all of dark matter) can be contained in PBHs. In part of the parameter space their mergers may be observable by advanced LIGO. We observe a remarkable complementarity between CMB observations, PBH constraints and GW searches in constraining the parameter space of this setup.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After a review of axion inflation in Sec.~\ref{sec:review}, we extend the formalism to account for a non-minimal coupling to gravity in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-minimal}. This in particular includes the computation of the resulting scalar and tensor perturbations, sourced by both the quantum mechanical vacuum contribution and the classical gauge field contribution. In Sec.~\ref{sec:attractors} we apply these results to inflation models described by attractors at strong coupling. We dedicate Sec.~\ref{sec:PBHs} to the production of primordial black holes, discussing different regions of the parameter space based on a handful of benchmark models. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions}. The main results of this paper are supported by three appendices. In App.~\ref{sec:axions} we discuss how the type of axions we consider here arise in the context of field theory, supergravity and string theory. Some of the details of the derivations of the scalar power spectrum are left to App.~\ref{sec:spectrum}. Finally, App.~\ref{app:PBH} analyses how uncertainties related to the PBH formation and evolution impact our results.

\section{Introduction}

According to the cosmological Standard Model (SM), neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium at early times and decoupled at temperatures of order $1$ MeV. This decoupling left behind a cosmic neutrino background which has been emitted much earlier than the analogous cosmic microwave background (CMB). Due to the weakness of the weak interactions, this cosmic neutrino background cannot be detected directly, and so goes under the name of `dark radiation'. Its contribution to the total energy density $\rho_{\rm tot}$ is parameterised in terms of the effective number of neutrino-like species $N_{\rm eff}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm tot} = \rho_{\gamma} \left( 1 + \frac{7}{8}\left( \frac{4}{11} \right)^{4/3} N_{\rm eff} \right).
\end{equation}
The SM predictions for $N_{\rm eff}$ are $N_{\rm eff}=3$ during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and $N_{\rm eff}=3.046$ at CMB times since neutrinos get slightly reheated when electrons and positrons annihilate. Any departure from these values would be a clear signal of physics beyond the SM due to the presence of extra dark radiation controlled by the parameter $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\equiv N_{\rm eff} - N_{\rm eff, SM}$.

Given that $N_{\rm eff}$ is positively correlated with the present value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, the comparison between indirect estimates of $H_0$ from CMB experiments and direct astrophysical measurements of $H_0$ could signal the need for extra dark radiation. The Planck 2013 value of the Hubble constant is $H_0 = (67.3\pm 1.2)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) \cite{Ade:2013zuv} which is in tension at $2.5\sigma$ with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) value $H_0 = (73.8\pm 2.4)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) \cite{Riess:2011yx}. Hence the Planck 2013 estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ with this HST `$H_0$ prior' is $N_{\rm eff} = 3.62^{+0.50}_{-0.48}$ ($95\%$ CL) \cite{Ade:2013zuv} which is more than $2\sigma$ away from the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 1.07$ at $2\sigma$.

However the HST Cepheid data have been reanalysed by \cite{Efstathiou:2013via} who found the different value $H_0 = (70.6\pm 3.3)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) which is within $1\sigma$ of the Planck 2015 estimate $H_0 = (67.3\pm 1.0)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) \cite{Planck:2015xua}. Hence the Planck 2015 collaboration performed a new estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ without using any `$H_0$ prior' and obtaining $N_{\rm eff} = 3.13 \pm 0.32$ ($68\%$ CL) \cite{Planck:2015xua} which is perfectly consistent with the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 0.72$ at around $2\sigma$. This result might seem to imply that extra dark radiation is ruled out but this naive interpretation can be misleading since larger $N_{\rm eff}$ corresponds to larger $H_0$ and there is still an unresolved controversy in the direct measurement of $H_0$. In fact the Planck 2015 paper \cite{Planck:2015xua} analyses also the case with the prior $\Delta N_{\rm eff}=0.39$ obtaining the result $H_0 = (70.6\pm 1.0)$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($68\%$ CL) which is even in better agreement with the new HST estimate of $H_0$ performed in \cite{Efstathiou:2013via}. Thus we stress that trustable direct astrophysical measurements of $H_0$ are crucial in order to obtain reliable bounds on $N_{\rm eff}$. 

$N_{\rm eff}$ is also constrained by measurements of primordial light element abundances. The Planck 2015 estimate of $N_{\rm eff}$ based on the helium primordial abundance and combined with the measurements of \cite{Aver:2013wba} is $N_{\rm eff}= 3.11^{+0.59}_{-0.57}$ ($95\%$ CL) giving $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 0.65$ at $2\sigma$ \cite{Planck:2015xua}. However measurements of light element abundances are difficult and often affected by systematic errors, and so also in this case there is still some controversy in the literature since \cite{Izotov:2014fga} reported a larger helium abundance that, in turn, leads to $N_{\rm eff}= 3.58 \pm 0.50$ ($99\%$ CL) which is $3\sigma$ away from the SM value and gives $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \leq 1.03$ at $3\sigma$. Due to all these experimental considerations, in the rest of this paper we shall consider $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$ as a reference upper bound for the presence of extra dark radiation.

Extra neutrino-like species can be produced in any beyond the SM theory which features hidden sectors with new relativistic degrees of freedom (\textit{dof}). In particular, extra dark radiation is naturally generated when reheating is driven by the decay of a gauge singlet since in this case there is no a priori good reason to suppress the branching ratio into hidden sector light particles \cite{DR1, DR2, AxionProbl}. 

This situation is reproduced in string models of the early universe due to the presence of gravitationally coupled moduli which get displaced from their minimum during inflation, start oscillating when the Hubble scale reaches their mass, quickly come to dominate the energy density of the universe since they redshift as matter and finally reheat the universe when they decay \cite{NTDM, NonThDMinSeqLVS}. In the presence of many moduli, the crucial one is the lightest since its decay dilutes any previous relic produced by the decay of heavier moduli.

Two important cosmological constraints have to be taken into account: (i) the lightest modulus has to decay before BBN in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions for the light element abundances \cite{CMP}; (ii) the modulus decay to gravitini should be suppressed in order to avoid problems of dark matter overproduction because of gravitini annihilation or modifications of BBN predictions \cite{gravProbl}. The first constraint sets a lower bound on the lightest modulus mass of order $m_{\rm mod} \gtrsim 30$ TeV, while a straightforward way to satisfy the second constraint is $m_{\rm mod}< 2 m_{3/2}$. 

However in general in string compactifications the moduli develop a mass because of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking effects which make the gravitino massive via the super Higgs mechanism and generate also soft-terms of order $M_{\rm soft}$. Because of their common origin, one has therefore $m_{\rm mod}\sim m_{3/2}\sim M_{\rm soft}$. The cosmological lower bound $m_{\rm mod}\gtrsim 30$ TeV then pushes the soft-terms well above the TeV-scale ruining the solution of the hierarchy problem based on low-energy SUSY. An intriguing way-out is given by type IIB string compactifications where the visible sector is constructed via fractional D3-branes at singularities \cite{Aldazabal:2000sa, Conlon:2008wa, CYembedding}. In this case the blow-up modulus resolving the singularity is fixed at zero size in a supersymmetric manner, resulting in the absence of local SUSY breaking effects. SUSY is instead broken by bulk moduli far away from the visible sector singularity. Because of this geometric separation, the visible sector is said to be `sequestered' since the soft-terms can be suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass by $\epsilon = \frac{m_{3/2}}{M_P}\ll 1$ \cite{SeqLVS}. 

A concrete example of sequestered SUSY breaking is given by the type IIB LARGE Volume Scenario (LVS) with D3-branes at singularities, which is characterised by the following hierarchy of masses \cite{SeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \epsilon \ll m_{\rm mod} \sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon} \ll m_{3/2}\,.
\label{masses}
\end{equation}
This mass spectrum guarantees the absence of moduli decays to gravitini and allows for gaugino masses $M_{1/2}$ around the TeV-scale for $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^7$ GeV and $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. On the other hand, SUSY scalar masses $m_0$ are more model dependent since their exact $\epsilon$-dependence is determined by the form of the K\"ahler metric for visible sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. The general analysis of \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS} found two possible $\epsilon$-scalings for scalar masses: (i) $m_0\sim M_{1/2}$ corresponding to a typical MSSM-like scenario and (ii) $m_0 \sim m_{\rm mod} \gg M_{1/2}$ resulting in a split SUSY-like case with heavy squarks and sleptons.

Following the cosmological evolution of these scenarios, reheating takes place due to the decay of the volume modulus which produces, together with visible sector particles, also hidden sector \textit{dof} which could behave as extra dark radiation \cite{DR1, DR2}. Some hidden sector \textit{dof} are model dependent whereas others, like bulk closed string axions, are always present, and so give a non-zero contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. In fact, as shown in \cite{DMDRcorr}, the production of axionic dark radiation is unavoidable in any string model where reheating is driven by the moduli decay and some of the moduli are stabilised by perturbative effects which keep the corresponding axions light. Note that light closed string axions can be removed from the low-energy spectrum via the St\"uckelberg mechanism only for cycles collapsed to zero size since in the case of cycles in the geometric regime the combination of axions eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$ is mostly given by open string axions \cite{DMDRcorr}. 

R-parity odd visible sector particles produced from the lightest modulus decay subsequently decay to the lightest SUSY particle, which is one of the main dark matter candidates. Due to their common origin, axionic dark radiation and neutralino dark matter have an interesting correlation \cite{DMDRcorr}. In fact, by combining present bounds on $N_{\rm eff}$ with lower bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$ as a function of the dark matter mass $m_\DM$ from recent Fermi data, one can set interesting constraints on the $(N_{\rm eff}, m_\DM)$-plane. \cite{DMDRcorr} found that standard thermal dark matter is allowed only if $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\to 0$ while the vast majority of the allowed parameter space requires non-thermal scenarios with Higgsino-like dark matter, in agreement with the results of \cite{Aparicio:2015sda} for the MSSM-like case.

Dark radiation production for the MSSM-like case has been studied in \cite{DR1, DR2} which showed that the leading decay channels of the volume modulus are to visible sector Higgses via the Giudice-Masiero (GM) term and to ultra-light bulk closed string axions. The simplest model with two Higgs doublets and a shift-symmetric Higgs sector yields $1.53 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1.60$, where the window has been obtained by varying the reheating temperature between $500$ MeV and $5$ GeV, which are typical values for gravitationally coupled scalars with masses in the range $m_{\rm mod}\simeq (1 \div 5) \cdot 10^7$ GeV. These values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ lead to dark radiation overproduction since they are in tension with current observational bounds.\footnote{Radiative corrections to the modulus coupling to Higgs fields do not give rise to a significant change in the final prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ \cite{DRloop}.} Possible way-outs to reduce $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ involve models with either a larger GM coupling or more than two Higgs doublets.

Due to this tension with dark radiation overproduction, different models have been studied in the literature. \cite{Angus:2014bia} showed how sequestered LVS models where the Calabi-Yau (CY) volume is controlled by more than one divisor are ruled out since they predict huge values of extra dark radiation of order $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\sim 10^4$. On the other hand, \cite{Hebecker:2014gka} focused on non-sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is realised via D7-branes wrapping the large cycle controlling the CY volume.\footnote{Another option involves flavour D7-branes wrapped around the volume divisor and intersecting the visible sector D3-branes localised at a singularity \cite{Hebecker:2014gka}.} In this way, the decay rate of the lightest modulus to visible sector gauge bosons becomes comparable to the decay to bulk axions, and so the prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can become smaller. In fact, the simplest model with a shift-symmetric Higgs sector yields $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq 0.5$ \cite{Hebecker:2014gka}. However this case necessarily requires high-scale SUSY since without sequestering $M_{\rm soft}\sim m_{3/2}$ (up to loop factors), and so from~\eqref{masses} we see that the cosmological bound $m_{\rm mod}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon}\gtrsim 30$ TeV implies $M_{\rm soft} \sim m_{3/2} \gtrsim \left(30\,{\rm TeV}\right)^{2/3} M_P^{1/3}\sim 10^9$ GeV. Moreover in this case the visible sector gauge coupling is set by the CY volume ${V}$, $\alpha_\SM^{-1} \sim {V}^{2/3} \sim 25$, and so it is hard to achieve large values of ${V}$ without introducing a severe fine-tuning of some underlying parameters. A possible way-out could be to consider anisotropic compactifications where the CY volume is controlled by a large divisor and a small cycle which supports the visible sector \cite{Cicoli:2011yy, Anis}.

In this paper we take instead a different point of view and keep focusing on sequestered models as in \cite{DR1, DR2} since they are particularly promising for phenomenological applications: they are compatible with TeV-scale SUSY and gauge coupling unification without suffering from any cosmological moduli and gravitino problem, they can be embedded in globally consistent CY compactifications \cite{CYembedding} and allow for successful inflationary models \cite{KMI} and neutralino non-thermal dark matter phenomenology \cite{Aparicio:2015sda}. Following the general analysis of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the visible sector performed in \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS} for sequestered type IIB LVS models with D3-branes at singularities, we focus on the split-SUSY case where squarks and sleptons acquire a mass of order the lightest modulus mass: $m_0 = c\, m_{\rm mod}$ with $c\sim {O}(1)$. We compute the exact value of the coefficient $c$ for different split-SUSY cases depending on the form of the K\"ahler metric for visible sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. We find that the condition $c\leq 1/2$, which allows the new decay channel to SUSY scalars, can be satisfied only by including string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Berg:2007wt, extendednoscale}. However this relation holds only at the string scale $M_s \sim 10^{15}$ GeV whereas the decay of the lightest modulus takes place at an energy of order its mass $m_{\rm mod}\sim 10^7$ GeV. Hence we consider the Renormalisation Group (RG) running of the SUSY scalar masses from $M_s$ to $m_{\rm mod}$ and then compare their value to $m_{\rm mod}$ whose running is in practice negligible since moduli have only gravitational couplings. Given that also the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible effect in split SUSY-like models, we find that radiative corrections do not alter the parameter space region where the lightest modulus decay to SUSY scalars opens up. 

We then compute the new predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ which gets considerably reduced with respect to the MSSM-like case considered in \cite{DR1, DR2} since the branching ratio to visible sector particles increases due to the new decay to squarks and sleptons and the new contribution to the decay to Higgses from their mass term. We find that the simplest model with a shift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ to values as small as $0.14$ in perfect agreement with current experimental bounds. Depending on the exact value of $m_0$ all values in the range $0.14 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1.6$ are allowed. Interestingly $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can be within the allowed experimental window also in the case of vanishing GM coupling $Z = 0$ since the main suppression of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ comes from the lightest modulus decay to squarks and sleptons. Given that a correct realisation of radiative Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) in split SUSY-like models requires in general a large $\mu$-term of order $m_0$, the lightest modulus branching ratio into visible sector \textit{dof} is also slightly increased due to its decay to Higgsinos. However this new decay channel yields just a negligible correction to the final prediction for dark radiation production. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Sec.~\ref{LVSs} we review the main features of sequestered LVS models whereas Sec.~\ref{drs} contains the main results of this paper since it analyses the predictions for axionic dark radiation. We present our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{Concl}.

\section{Sequestered LARGE Volume Scenario}
\label{LVSs}

In this section we shall present a brief review of sequestered type IIB LVS models with D3-branes at singularities \cite{CYembedding, SeqLVS, SoftTermsSeqLVS}. After describing the general setup of the $N=1$ supergravity effective field theory, we outline the procedure followed to fix all closed string moduli in a dS vacuum which breaks SUSY spontaneously. We then list all the relevant D- and F-terms and the final results for the soft-terms generated by gravity mediation (anomaly mediation contributions can be shown to be negligible \cite{SeqLVS, SoftTermsSeqLVS}).


\subsection{Effective field theory setup}

The simplest LVS model which leads to a visible sector sequestered from SUSY breaking is based on a CY manifold whose volume takes the form:
\begin{equation}
{V} = \left(T_b+\overline{T}_b\right)^{3/2} - \left(T_s+\overline{T}_s\right)^{3/2} - \left(T_\SM+\overline{T}_\SM\right)^{3/2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tau_i~\equiv {\rm Re} (T_i) = {\rm Vol}(D_i)$ parameterises the volume of the divisor $D_i$ and $\psi_i~\equiv {\rm Im}(T_i) = \int_{D_i} C_4$. $D_b$ is the `big' divisor which controls the CY size, $D_s$ is a `small' blow-up modulus supporting non-perturbative effects and $D_\SM$ is the `Standard Model' cycle which collapses to a singularity where the visible sector D3-branes are localised. More precisely, explicit realisations in compact CY manifolds involve two identical shrinkable divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ which are exchanged by the orientifold involution \cite{CYembedding}. This gives rise to an orientifold even cycle $D_+=D_1+D_2$ and an orientifold odd cycle $D_-=D_1-D_2$. $D_+$ is identified with $D_\SM$ whereas $D_-$ gives rise to an additional K\"ahler modulus $G= \int_{D_-} B_2 +i \int_{D_-} C_2$. Both $\tau_\SM$ and ${\rm Re}(G)$ develop a vanishing VEV due to D-term stabilisation while the corresponding axions $\psi_\SM$ and ${\rm Im}(G)$ are eaten up by two anomalous $U(1)$s \cite{Conlon:2008wa}. 

The resulting low-energy $N=1$ effective field theory is characterised by the following K\"ahler potential with leading order $\alpha'$ correction (without loss of generality we ignore from now on the orientifold odd modulus $G$):
\begin{equation}
K = - 2 \ln\left({V} + \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\right) + \frac{\tau_\SM^2}{{V}} - \ln\left(S+\overline{S}\right) + K_{\rm cs}(U) + K_{\rm matter}\,,
\label{generalk}
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the axion-dilaton, $\hat\xi\equiv \xi {\rm Re}(S)^{3/2}$, $K_{\rm cs}(U)$ is the tree-level K\"ahler potential for the complex structure moduli $U$ and $K_{\rm matter}$ is the K\"ahler potential for visible matter fields $C$ which is taken to be:
\begin{equation}
K_{\rm matter} = \tilde{K}\left[f_\alpha(U,S)\,\overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} C^\alpha + Z(U,S)\,\left(H_u H_d + {\rm h.c.}\right)\right]\,,
\label{kmatter}
\end{equation}
where the matter metric is assumed to be flavour diagonal and \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}: 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K}=\frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}}\left(1-c_s\frac{\hat\xi}{{V}}\right),
\label{Ktilde}
\end{equation}
and the bilinear Higgs mixing term is proportional to the GM coupling $Z$ which we allow to depend on $S$ and $U$-moduli. Note that additional contributions to~\eqref{generalk} can come from either an extra sector responsible for achieving a dS vacuum or from higher $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ corrections \cite{Berg:2007wt, extendednoscale}.

The superpotential takes instead the form:
\begin{equation}
W = W_{\rm flux}(U,S) + A(U,S)\,e^{-a_s T_s} + W_{\rm matter}\,,
\label{sp}
\end{equation}
where $W_{\rm flux}(U,S)$ is generated by three-form background fluxes, $A(U,S)$ and $a_s$ depend on the D-brane configuration which generates non-perturbative effects and the matter superpotential $W_{\rm matter}$ takes the form:
\begin{equation}
W_{\rm matter} = \mu(U,S,T) H_u H_d + Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S,T)  C^\alpha C^\beta C^\gamma + \dots\,,
\end{equation}
where the $\mu$-term and the Yukawa couplings $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ can depend on the $T$-moduli only at non-perturbative level.

Finally, the expression for the gauge kinetic function of the visible sector localised at the singularity $\tau_\SM\to 0$ is:
\begin{equation}
f_a = k_a S+ \lambda_a T_\SM\,\to\, k_a S\,,
\label{gkf}
\end{equation}
where $k_a$ is a singularity-dependent coefficient. 


\subsection{de Sitter moduli stabilisation}
\label{mss}

The scalar potential receives several contributions from various effects which are suppressed by different inverse powers of the overall volume ${V}$. By taking the large volume limit ${V}\gg 1$, the moduli can therefore be stabilised order by order in $1/{V}$. All closed string moduli are stabilised $\acute{a}$ la LVS by the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item At leading $1/{V}^2$ order, the dilaton and the $U$-moduli are stabilised by background fluxes while $\tau_\SM$ shrinks to zero via D-term stabilisation and $\psi_\SM$ is eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$ \cite{Conlon:2008wa, CYembedding}.

\item At subleading $1/{V}^3$ order, $\tau_s$ and $\psi_s$ are stabilised by non-perturbative corrections to $W$ while $\tau_b$ is fixed at exponentially large values by the interplay between $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects. The scalar potential at $1/{V}^3$ order looks like:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{8}{3}(a_s A_s)^2 \sqrt{\tau_s} \,\frac{e^{- 2 a_s \tau_s}}{{V}}- 4 a_s A_s W_0 \tau_s \,\frac{e^{-a_s \tau_s}}{{V}^2 } + \frac{3\hat\xi W_0^2}{4{V}^3} + V_\dS\,,
\label{v0}
\end{equation}
where we included a model-dependent positive contribution $V_\dS$ in order to obtain a dS solution. The minimum of this potential is at:
\begin{equation}
e^{-a_s \tau_s} \simeq \frac{3 \sqrt{\tau_s} W_0}{4 a_s A_s {V}} \qquad\qquad \tau_s^{3/2} \simeq \frac{\hat{\xi}}{2}= \frac{\xi}{2}\frac{1}{g_s^{3/2}}\,,
\label{lvsmin}
\end{equation}
with subleading $V_\dS$-dependent corrections. Following \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}, we shall consider two possible mechanisms to generate $V_\dS$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item dS$_1$ case: hidden sector matter fields $\phi_\dS$ living on D7-branes wrapping $D_b$ acquire non-zero VEVs because of D-term stabilisation. In turn, their F-term scalar potential gives rise to a positive contribution which scales as $V_\dS \sim W_0^2/{V}^{8/3}$ and can be used to obtain a dS vacuum \cite{CYembedding}. 
\item dS$_2$ case: a viable dS vacuum can arise also due to non-perturbative effects at the singularity obtained by shrinking to zero an additional divisor $D_\dS$ \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. The corresponding K\"ahler modulus $T_\dS = \tau_\dS + i \psi_\dS$ is again fixed by D-terms which set $\tau_\dS\to 0$ ($\psi_\dS$ is eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$). The new contribution to the superpotential $W_\dS = A_\dS e^{-a_\dS (S + k_\dS T_\dS)}$ yields a positive term which scales as $V_\dS \sim e^{-2 a_\dS {\rm Re}(S)}/{V}$ and can be used to develop a dS vacuum.
\end{enumerate}

\item At very suppressed $e^{-{V}^{2/3}}/{V}^{4/3}$ order, also $\psi_b$ develops a mass via $T_b$-dependent non-perturbative contributions to $W$. For ${V}\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^3$, the scale of this tiny contribution to $V$ is smaller than the present value of the cosmological constant, and so no additional `uplifting' term is needed.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{F- and D-terms}
\label{sts}

The typical feature of models with D3-branes at singularities is the fact that the SM modulus $T_\SM$ (together with the corresponding orientifold odd modulus $G$) does not break SUSY since its F-term is proportional to $\tau_\SM$ that shrinks to zero via D-term stabilisation:
\begin{equation}
F^{T_\SM} = F^G = 0\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore there is no local SUSY breaking effect and the visible sector is said to be \textit{sequestered} from SUSY breaking which takes place in the bulk via the following non-zero F-terms (we write down only the leading order expressions) \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^{T_b}}{\tau_b} \simeq -2 m_{3/2}\,, \qquad \qquad \frac{F^{T_s}}{\tau_s} \simeq -\frac 32 \frac{m_{3/2}}{a_s\tau_s}\,, 
\end{equation}
where the gravitino mass is $m_{3/2} = e^{K/2} |W| \sim M_P/{V}$. Because of subleading $S$ and $U$-dependent corrections to $V$ at $1/{V}^3$ order, also the dilaton and complex structure moduli develop non-zero F-terms of order \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^S}{s}\sim \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}}\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}\qquad\text{and}\qquad F^U\sim F^S\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, the fields responsible for achieving a dS vacuum contribute to SUSY breaking via \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_1 \, {\rm case}: \quad F^{\phi_\dS} \simeq \phi_\dS m_{3/2}  \qquad\qquad {\rm dS}_2 \,{\rm case}: \quad F^{T_\dS} \simeq m_{3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
Further contributions to SUSY breaking come from non-zero D-terms. For non-tachyonic scalar masses, the visible sector D-term potential vanishes whereas for the two dS cases, the hidden sector D-term potential at the minimum scales as \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_1 \, {\rm case}: \quad V_D \sim m_{3/2}^4 {V}^{2/3} \sim {V}^{-10/3}  \qquad\qquad {\rm dS}_2 \,{\rm case}: \quad V_D\sim m_{3/2}^4 \sim {V}^{-4}\,.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Soft SUSY breaking terms}

Gravitational interactions mediate SUSY breaking to the visible sector generating soft-terms at the string scale. Let us summarise all the main results for the soft-terms.

\subsubsection{Gaugino masses}

Given the form of the gauge kinetic functions~\eqref{gkf}, the gaugino masses turn out to be universal and read:
\begin{equation}
M_{1/2} = \frac{M_P}{2 \text{Re}(f)}\, F^i\partial_i f = \frac{F^S}{2 s} \sim \frac{m_{3/2}}{{V}}\left(\ln{V}\right)^{3/2}\,.
\label{gm}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Scalar masses}
\label{Sec:m0}

Scalar masses depend on the K\"ahler matter metric since their supergravity expression reads:
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha^2 = m_{3/2}^2 - F^i \overline{F}^{\overline{j}} \partial_i \partial_{\overline{j}} \ln \tilde{K}_\alpha\,.
\end{equation}
It is therefore crucial to determine the exact moduli-dependence of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ focusing in particular on the dependence on the volume ${V}$ since $F^{T_b}$ is the largest F-term. This dependence can be inferred relatively easily by requiring that the physical Yukawa couplings $\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ (we neglect here tiny non-perturbative $T$-dependent contributions to $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$):
\begin{equation}
\label{yuk}
\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = e^{K/2}\,\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\sqrt {\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma} }
= \left(\frac{e^K}{\tilde{K}^3}\right)^{1/2}\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\sqrt {f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma} } \,,
\end{equation}
should not depend on ${V}$ due to the locality of the SM construction. This translates into the condition:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K} = e^{K/3}\,,
\label{ul}
\end{equation}
which can lead to two different limits \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] \textit{Local limit}: the relation~\eqref{ul} holds only at leading order in $1/{V}$;
\item[2.] \textit{Ultra-local limit}: the relation~\eqref{ul} holds exactly.
\end{itemize}
The expansion~\eqref{Ktilde} of $\tilde{K}$ guarantees that~\eqref{ul} is exact at leading order, as required in the local case. The ultra-local limit is then realised only for $c_s = 1/3$. Let us see how scalar masses get affected by the exact form of $\tilde{K}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Local limit}: in this case scalar masses are universal and do not depend on the sector responsible for getting a dS vacuum. Their leading order expression is generated by $F^{T_b}$ and looks like:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = \frac{15}{2}\left(c_s-\frac{1}{3}\right)\, \frac{m_{3/2}^2 \tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}\sim m_{3/2} M_{1/2}\,,
\label{lsm}
\end{equation}
Note that non-tachyonic scalars require $c_s \geq 1/3$ and $M_{1/2}\ll m_0$ leading to a typical split-SUSY spectrum.

\item \emph{Ultra-local limit}: in this case scalar masses depend on the dS sector. Setting $c_s=1/3$ kills the leading contribution to~\eqref{lsm} from $F^{T_b}$. Subleading effects depend on $F^U$ and $F^S$ which are volume-suppressed with respect to $F^{T_b}$ since the dilaton and complex structure moduli are fixed supersymmetrically at leading order. Due to this cancellation, D-term contributions to scalar masses turn out to be the dominant effect for the dS$_1$ case leading to universal and non-tachyonic scalar masses of the form:
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_1 \, {\rm case}: \qquad m_0^2 = \frac{9}{4 a_s\tau_s} \frac{m_{3/2}^2\tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}\sim \frac{m_{3/2}}{\ln{V}}M_{1/2}\,.
\label{ul1}
\end{equation}
This is again a split SUSY-like scenario. On the other hand, D-term contributions vanish in the dS$_2$ case where the leading effects generating scalar masses come from $F^U$ and $F^S$ that give:
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_2 \, {\rm case}: \qquad \quad m_\alpha^2 =  c_\alpha(U,S) {\rm Re}(S)^2 M_{1/2}^2\,,
\label{ul2}
\end{equation}
where the function $c_\alpha(U,S)$ involves derivatives of $f_\alpha(U,S)$ with respect to $U$ and $S$ \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}. In this case scalar masses are potentially non-universal and tachyonic depending on the exact functional dependence of $f_\alpha(U,S)$. This situation reproduces a standard MSSM-like scenario. Dark radiation production in this case has been studied in \cite{DR1, DR2}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{$\mu$ and $B\mu$ terms}

The other soft-terms relevant for the computation of dark radiation production from moduli decays are the canonically normalised $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat{\mu}$ terms. These two terms receive contributions from both the K\"ahler potential and the superpotential. The more model-independent contribution from $K$ is induced by a non-zero GM coupling $Z$ in~\eqref{kmatter}. It turns out that in each dS case $\hat\mu$ is always proportional to $M_{1/2}$ whereas $B\hat\mu$ scales as $m_0^2$ \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
\hat\mu = c_{\mu,K}(U,S) Z M_{1/2}\,, \qquad \qquad B \hat\mu = c_{B,K}(U,S) Z m_0^2\,,
\label{bmu}
\end{equation}
where $c_{\mu,K}(U,S)$ and $c_{B,K}(U,S)$ are two tunable flux-dependent coefficients.

Additional contributions to $\hat{\mu}$ and $B\hat{\mu}$ can come from model-dependent non-perturbative effects which produce an effective $\mu$-term in the superpotential of the form \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}:
\begin{equation}
W \supset e^{-a T} H_u H_d\,,
\end{equation}
if the cycle associated to $\tau = \text{Re}(T)$ is in the geometric regime while:
\begin{equation}
W \supset e^{-b(S + \kappa T)} H_u H_d\,,
\end{equation}
if the cycle associated to $\tau = \text{Re}(T)$ is in the singular regime, i.e. if $\tau \rightarrow 0$. These non-perturbative effects generate effective $\hat{\mu}$- and $B\hat{\mu}$-terms in the low-energy action which can be parameterised as:
\begin{equation}
\label{mubmu}
\hat{\mu} \simeq \frac{c_{\mu,W}(U,S)}{{V}^{n + \frac{1}{3}}}\,, \qquad\qquad B\hat{\mu} \simeq \frac{c_{B,W}(U,S)}{{V}^{n + \frac{4}{3}}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $c_{\mu,W}(U,S)$ and $c_{B,W}(U,S)$ are flux-dependent tunable coefficients and $n$ is the instanton number. As we shall explain in Sec.~\ref{splitsusycase}, this model-dependent contribution to the $\mu$-term is crucial to reproduce a correct radiative EWSB for most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like models.

\section{Dark radiation in sequestered models}
\label{drs}

As already argued in the Introduction, the production of dark radiation is a generic feature of string models where some of the moduli are fixed by perturbative effects \cite{DMDRcorr}. In fact, if perturbative corrections fix the real part of the modulus $T=\tau + {\rm i}\psi$, the axion $\psi$ remains exactly massless at this level of approximation due to its shift symmetry, leading to $m_\tau \gg m_\psi$. Hence very light relativistic axions can be produced by the decay of $\tau$, giving rise to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \neq 0$. 

\subsection{Dark radiation from moduli decays}

Following the cosmological evolution of the Universe, during inflation the canonically normalised modulus $\Phi$ gets a displacement from its late-time minimum of order $M_P$. After the end of inflation the value of the Hubble parameter $H$ decreases. When $H \sim m_\Phi$, $\Phi$ starts oscillating around its minimum and stores energy. During this stage $\Phi$ redshifts as matter, so that it quickly comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe. Afterwards reheating is caused by the decay of $\Phi$ which takes place when:
\begin{equation}
3 H^2 \simeq \frac43 \,\Gamma_\Phi^2\,,
\label{HG}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_\Phi$ is the total decay rate into visible and hidden \textit{dof}:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\Phi = \Gamma_{\rm vis} + \Gamma_{\rm hid} = \left(c_{\rm vis} + c_{\rm vis}\right) \Gamma_0\,,\qquad\text{with}
\qquad \Gamma_0~\equiv \frac{1}{48\pi}\frac{m_\Phi^3}{M_P^2}\,.
\label{G}
\end{equation}
The corresponding reheating temperature is given by:
\begin{equation} 
T_{\rm rh} = \left(\frac{30\,\rho_{\rm vis}}{\pi^2 g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{\frac 14}\,,
\label{Trh}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm vis} = \left(c_{\rm vis}/c_{\rm tot}\right) 3 H^2 M_P^2$ with $c_{\rm tot}=c_{\rm vis} + c_{\rm hid}$. 
Using~\eqref{HG} and~\eqref{G} $T_{\rm rh}$ can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm rh} \simeq \frac{1}{\pi} \left(\frac{5 c_{\rm vis} c_{\rm tot}}{288 g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{1/4} m_\Phi\,\sqrt{\frac{m_\Phi}{M_P}}\,.
\label{rt}
\end{equation}
This reheating temperature has to be larger than about $1$ MeV in order to preserve the successful BBN predictions. 

In the presence of a non-zero branching ratio for $\Phi$ decays into hidden sector \textit{dof}, i.e. for $c_{\rm hid}\neq 0$, extra axionic dark radiation gets produced, leading to \cite{DR1, DR2}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{43}{7} \frac{c_{\rm hid}}{c_{\rm vis}} \left(\frac{g_*(T_{\rm dec})}{g_*(T_{\rm rh})}\right)^{1/3},
\label{dn}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\rm dec} \simeq 1$ MeV is the temperature of the Universe at neutrino decoupling with $g_*(T_{\rm dec}) = 10.75$. 
The factor in brackets is due to the fact that axions are very weakly coupled (they are in practice only gravitationally coupled), and so they never reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, given that the comoving entropy density $g_*(T) T^3 a^3$ is conserved, the thermal bath gets slightly reheated when some species drop out of thermal equilibrium. Note that the observational reference bound $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$ implies:
\begin{equation}
c_{\rm vis}\gtrsim 3\, c_{\rm hid}\qquad\text{for}\qquad T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 0.2\,\text{GeV}\,,
\label{cbound}
\end{equation}
where we have used the fact that $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 75.75$ in the window $0.2\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 0.7\, {\rm GeV}$ while $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 86.25$ for $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 0.7\,\rm GeV$.

\subsection{Light relativistic axions in LVS models}

Let us summarise the main reasons why axionic dark radiation production is a typical feature of sequestered LVS models:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reheating is driven by the last modulus to decay which is $\tau_b$ since the moduli mass spectrum takes the form (the axion $\psi_\SM$ is eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$):
\begin{equation}
m_{\tau_b}\sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon} \ll m_{\tau_s} \sim m_{\psi_s} \sim m_S \sim m_U \sim m_{3/2} \ll m_{\tau_\SM} \sim \frac{m_{3/2}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\sim M_s\,,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon = m_{3/2}/M_P \sim W_0 / {V} \ll 1$. Given that gaugino masses scale as $M_{1/2}\sim m_{3/2} \epsilon$, TeV-scale SUSY fixes $m_{\tau_b}$ around $10^7$ GeV which in turn, using~\eqref{rt}, gives $T_{\rm rh}$ around $1$ GeV.\footnote{As in standard split SUSY models, we require TeV-scale gauginos for dark matter and gauge coupling unification. In MSSM-like models we focus on low-energy SUSY to address the hierarchy problem.} Note that $m_{\tau_b}\ll m_{3/2}$, and so sequestering addresses the gravitino problem since the decay of the volume modulus into gravitinos is kinematically forbidden.

\item Given that axions enjoy shift symmetries which are broken only by non-perturbative effects, the axionic partner $\psi_b$ of the volume mode $\tau_b$ is stabilised by non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential of the form $W \supset A_b\, e^{- a_b T_b} \sim e^{-{V}^{2/3}}\ll 1$. These tiny effects give rise to a vanishingly small mass $m_{\psi_b}^2 \sim e^{- {V}^{2/3}} \sim 0$. Hence these bulk closed string axions are in practice massless and can be produced from the decay of $\tau_b$ \cite{DR1, DR2}. 

\item Some closed string axions can be removed from the 4D spectrum via the St\"uckelberg mechanism in the process of anomaly cancellation. However, the combination of bulk axions eaten up by an anomalous $U(1)$ is mostly given by an open string mode, and so $\psi_b$ survives in the low-energy theory (the situation is opposite for axions at local singularities) \cite{DMDRcorr}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Volume modulus decay channels}

The aim of this section is to compute the ratio $c_{\rm hid}/c_{\rm vis}$ which is needed to predict the effective number of extra neutrino-like species $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ using (\ref{dn}).

\subsubsection{Decays into hidden sector fields}
\label{vmds}

Some hidden sector \textit{dof} are model dependent whereas others are generic features of LVS models. As pointed out above, bulk closed string axions are always a source of dark radiation. On top of them, there are local closed string axions which however tend to be eaten up by anomalous $U(1)$s (this is always the case for each del Pezzo singularity) and local open string axions (one of them could be the QCD axion \cite{CYembedding}) whose production from $\tau_b$ decay is negligibly small \cite{DR1}. Moreover the decay of $\tau_b$ into bulk closed string $U(1)$s is also a subdominant effect \cite{DR1}. Model dependent decay channels involve light \textit{dof} living on hidden D7-branes wrapping either $D_b$ or $D_s$ and hidden D3-branes at singularities which are geometrically separated from the one where the visible sector is localised. However, as explained in \cite{DR1}, the only decay channels which are not volume or loop suppressed are to light gauge bosons on the large cycle and to Higgses living on sequestered D3s different from the visible sector. Given that the presence of these states is non-generic and can be avoided by suitable hidden sector model building, we shall focus here just on $\tau_b$ decays into 
bulk closed string axions. 

The corresponding decay rate takes the form \cite{DR1,DR2}: 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow a a} = \Gamma_0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad c_{\rm hid}=1\,,
\label{ddr}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ and $a$ are, respectively, the canonically normalised real and imaginary parts of the big modulus $T_b$.
This result can be derived from the tree-level K\"ahler potential:
\begin{equation}
K \simeq - 3 \ln\left(\frac{T_b+\overline{T}_b}{2}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
which gives a kinetic Lagrangian of the form:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac{3}{4 \tau_b^2} \left(\partial_\mu \tau_b \partial^\mu \tau_b + \partial_\mu \psi_b \partial^\mu \psi_b\right)\,.
\label{lag1}
\end{equation}
After canonical normalisation of $\tau_b$ and $\psi_b$:
\begin{equation}
\label{cn1}
\frac{\Phi}{M_P} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \ln \tau_b\,, \qquad \qquad \frac{a}{M_P} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{\psi_b}{\langle \tau_b \rangle}\,,
\end{equation}
and expanding $\Phi$ as $\Phi = \Phi_0 + \hat \Phi$, the kinetic Lagrangian~\eqref{lag1} can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm kin} = \frac 12 \partial_\mu \hat\Phi \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \frac 12 \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a 
- \sqrt{\frac 23 } \frac{\hat \Phi}{M_P} \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a\,,
\end{equation}
which encodes the coupling of the volume modulus to its axionic partner. Integrating by parts and using the equation of motion 
$\Box \hat \Phi = - m_\Phi^2 \hat \Phi$ we obtain the coupling:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\Phi a a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_P} \hat\Phi a a\,,
\label{lphiaa}
\end{equation}
which yields the decay rate~\eqref{ddr}.

\subsubsection{Decays into visible sector fields}

The dominant volume modulus decays into visible sector \textit{dof} are to Higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. Additional leading order decay channels can be to SUSY scalars and Higgsinos depending respectively on $m_0$ and $\hat\mu$. On the other hand, as explained in \cite{DR1,DR2}, $\tau_b$ decays into visible gauge bosons are loop suppressed, i.e. $c_{\Phi\to A A}\sim \alpha_\SM^2 \ll 1$, whereas decays into matter fermions and gauginos are chirality suppressed, i.e. $c_{\Phi\to f f}\sim \left(m_f/m_\Phi\right)^2 \ll 1$. The main goal of this section is to compute the cubic interaction Lagrangian which gives rise to the decay of the volume modulus into Higgses, Higgsinos, squarks and sleptons.

\subsubsection*{Decay into scalar fields}

Let us first focus on the volume modulus decays into visible scalar fields which are induced by the $\tau_b$-dependence of both kinetic and mass terms in the total effective Lagrangian ${L} = {L}_{\rm kin} - V$. ${L}_{\rm kin}$ is determined by the leading order K\"ahler potential:
\begin{equation}
K \simeq - 3 \ln\left(\frac{T_b+\overline{T}_b}{2}\right) + \frac{2}{T_b + \overline{T}_b} \left[f_\alpha(U,S) \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} C^\alpha 
+ \left(Z H_u H_d + \rm h.c.\right)\right]\,,
\end{equation}
where we included only the leading term of the K\"ahler matter metric $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ in~\eqref{kmatter}. 
Writing each complex scalar field as $C^\alpha = \frac{\rm{Re} C^\alpha + i \rm{Im} C^\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}$, 
the canonically normalised real scalar fields look like:
\begin{eqnarray}
h_1 &=& \lambda_u {\rm Re} H_u^+ \qquad h_2 = \lambda_d {\rm Re} H_d^-
\qquad h_3 = \lambda_d {\rm Re} H_d^0 \qquad h_4 = \lambda_u {\rm Re} H_u^0  \nonumber\\ \\
h_5 &=& \lambda_d {\rm Im} H_d^0  \qquad h_6 = \lambda_u {\rm Im} H_u^0 
\qquad h_7 = \lambda_u {\rm Im} H_u^+  \qquad h_8 = \lambda_d {\rm Im} H_d^-  \nonumber\\ \\
\sigma_\alpha &=& \lambda_\alpha {\rm Re} C_\alpha \qquad \chi_\alpha = \lambda_\alpha {\rm Im} C_\alpha
\qquad\text{where}\qquad \lambda_i\equiv \sqrt{\frac{f_i(U,S)}{\langle \tau_b\rangle}}\,. 
\label{fields}
\end{eqnarray}
Keeping only terms which are at most cubic in the fields and neglecting axion-scalar-scalar interactions, we can schematically 
write the kinetic Lagrangian as ${L}_{\rm kin} = {L}_{\rm{kin, quad}} + {L}_{\rm{kin, cubic}}$ where:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm{kin, quad}} = \frac 12 \partial_\mu \hat\Phi \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \frac 12 \partial_\mu a \partial^\mu a 
+ \frac 12 \partial_\mu h_i \partial^\mu h^i + \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \sigma_\alpha \partial^\mu \sigma^\alpha 
+ \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \chi_\alpha \partial^\mu \chi^\alpha\,, \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
while the cubic part can be further decomposed as ${L}_{\rm{kin, cubic}} = {L}_{\Phi a a} + {L}_{\Phi h h} + {L}_{\Phi C C}$, 
with ${L}_{\Phi aa}$ given in~\eqref{lphiaa} and:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\Phi h h} =  - \frac{1}{M_P\sqrt{6}} \left[\partial_\mu \hat\Phi h_i\partial^\mu h^i + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu h_i \partial^\mu h^i
+Z\partial_\mu \hat\Phi \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}\left(h_{2i}\partial^\mu h_{2i-1} + h_{2i-1}\partial^\mu h_{2i} \right)\right], \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\Phi C C} = - \frac{1}{M_P\sqrt{6}} \left(\sigma_\alpha \partial_\mu \sigma^\alpha \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \chi_\alpha \partial_\mu \chi^\alpha \partial^\mu \hat\Phi + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu \sigma_\alpha \partial^\mu \sigma^\alpha + \hat\Phi \partial_\mu \chi_\alpha \partial^\mu \chi^\alpha\right)\,. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
In addition to the LVS part, the scalar potential contains also the following terms:
\begin{equation}
\label{sp1}
V \supset \frac{1}{2}  m^2_0 \left( \sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha \right) 
+ \frac 12 \left(\hat{\mu}^2+m_0^2\right) h_i h^i + B\hat{\mu} \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\,.
\end{equation}
Since the soft-terms depend on the volume modulus, we can expand them as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{stexp}
\hat{\mu}^2&\propto& \tau_b^{-\alpha}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \hat{\mu}^2(\hat\Phi) = \hat{\mu}^2 \left(1-\alpha \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_P}\right)\,, \nonumber\\ \\
m_0^2&\propto& \tau_b^{-\beta}\quad\Rightarrow\quad m_0^2(\hat\Phi) = m_0^2 \left(1-\beta \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_P}\right)\,, \nonumber\\ \\
B\hat{\mu} &\propto& \tau_b^{-\gamma}\quad\Rightarrow\quad B\hat{\mu} (\hat\Phi) = B\hat{\mu} \left(1-\gamma \sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_P}\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ depend on the specific scenario. This expansion leads to new cubic interactions coming from the terms of the scalar potential in~\eqref{sp1}:
\begin{equation}
V\supset - \frac{1}{M_P\sqrt{6}} \left[\gamma m_0^2 \, \hat\Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha  + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha\right) 
+\left(\alpha \hat{\mu}^2 + \beta m_0^2 \right) \, \hat \Phi h_i h^i +2 \gamma B\hat{\mu} \, \hat \Phi \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right]. \nonumber\\
\end{equation}
Including the relevant cubic interactions coming from the kinetic Lagrangian and integrating by parts, we obtain a total cubic Lagrangian of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
{L}_{\rm cubic} &=& \frac{1}{M_P\sqrt{6}} \left[ \hat \Phi h_i \Box h^i + \hat \Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha \Box \sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha \Box \chi^\alpha \right) + \left(\alpha \hat{\mu}^2 + \beta m_0^2 \right) \, \hat \Phi h_i h^i\right. + \nonumber\\ \\
&+& \left. \gamma m_0^2 \, \hat \Phi \left(\sigma_\alpha\sigma^\alpha + \chi_\alpha\chi^\alpha\right)+\left(Z \Box \hat \Phi + 2\gamma B\hat{\mu} \, \hat\Phi\right) \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right]. \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
The leading order expressions of the equations of motion are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Box \sigma_\alpha &=& - m_0^2 \sigma_\alpha \qquad 
\Box h_{2i-1} =  - \left(\hat{\mu}^2 + m_0^2 \right) h_{2i-1} + (-1)^i B\hat{\mu} \, h_{2i} \quad i=1,\dots,4 \nonumber\\ \\
\Box \chi_\alpha &=& - m_0^2 \chi_\alpha \qquad
\Box h_{2j} =  - \left(\hat{\mu}^2 + m_0^2 \right) h_{2j} + (-1)^j B\hat{\mu} \, h_{2j-1} \quad j=1,\dots,4 \,, \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
which have to be supplemented with:
\begin{equation}
\Box \hat \Phi = - m_{\Phi}^2 \hat \Phi \qquad \qquad \Box a = - m_a^2 a \simeq 0\,.
\end{equation}
Plugging these equations of motion into ${L}_{\rm cubic}$, the final result becomes:
\begin{eqnarray}
{L}_{\rm cubic} &=& - \frac{1}{M_P\sqrt{6}} \left[\left(\hat{\mu}^2 \left(1 - \alpha\right) + m_0^2 \left(1 - \beta \right)\right) \, \hat\Phi h_i h^i 
+ (1 - \gamma) m_0^2 \, \hat \Phi \left(\sigma^\alpha\sigma_\alpha + \chi^\alpha\chi_\alpha\right)\right. \nonumber\\ \\
&+& \left. \left(2 B\hat{\mu} \left(1 - \gamma \right) + Z\, m_\Phi^2 \right)\, \hat\Phi \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right],
\label{finallagr}
\end{eqnarray}
from which it is easy to find the corresponding decay rates using the fact that: 
\begin{eqnarray}
{L}_1 &=& \lambda \frac{m^2}{M_P}\Phi \phi \phi \quad\Rightarrow \quad
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \phi \phi} = \lambda_1 \Gamma_0 \,,\quad \lambda_1 = 6\lambda^2\left(\frac{m}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^4 \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_\phi}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^2}\,, \label{dw1} \\
{L}_2 &=& \lambda \frac{m^2}{M_P}\Phi \phi_1 \phi_2\,\,\Rightarrow \,\,
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \phi_1 \phi_2} = \lambda_2 \Gamma_0\,, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2}\,\,\text{for}\,\, m_{\phi_1} = m_{\phi_2} = m_\phi\,.
\label{dw2}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection*{Decay into Higgsinos}

The decay of the volume modulus into Higgsinos is determined by expanding the Higgsino kinetic and mass terms around the VEV of $\tau_b$ and then working with canonically normalised fields. The relevant terms in the low-energy Lagrangian are:
\begin{equation}
{L} \supset i \tilde{H}^{\dagger}_i \overline{\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \tilde{H}^{i} \left(1-\sqrt{\frac 23}\frac{\hat\Phi}{M_P}\right)- \frac{\hat\mu}{2} \left(\tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^- - \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0\right)\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{6}} \frac{\hat\Phi}{M_P}\right) +\text{h.c.} \,.
\end{equation}
After imposing the equations of motion, we get the following cubic interaction Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
{L}_{\rm cubic} \supset \, \frac{\alpha}{2 \sqrt{6}} \, \frac{\hat\mu}{M_P} \,\hat\Phi \left(\tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^- - \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0\right)+\text{h.c.}\,.
\label{higgsinocubic}
\end{equation}
The corresponding decay rates take the form:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}_u^+ \tilde{H}_d^-} = \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}_u^0 \tilde{H}_d^0} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2 \left(1 - 4 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2\right)^{3/2} \Gamma_0 \,.
\label{higgsinosdr}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Dark radiation predictions}

It is clear from~\eqref{finallagr} and~\eqref{higgsinosdr} that the volume modulus branching ratio into visible sector \textit{dof} depends on the size of the soft-terms. Hence the final prediction for dark radiation production has to be studied separately for each different visible sector construction. 

\subsubsection{MSSM-like case}

Firstly we consider MSSM-like models arising from the ultra-local dS$_2$ case where all soft-terms are suppressed relative to the volume modulus mass:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 \simeq M_{1/2}^2 \simeq B\hat{\mu} \simeq \hat{\mu}^2 \sim \frac{M_P^2}{{V}^4} \ll m_{\Phi}^2 \sim \frac{M_P^2}{{V}^3}\,.
\end{equation}
Let us briefly review the results for dark radiation production which for this case have already been studied in \cite{DR1, DR2}. 

Given that all soft-terms are volume-suppressed with respect to $m_\Phi$, only the last term in~\eqref{finallagr} gives a non-negligible contribution to the volume modulus branching ratio into visible sector fields. Thus the leading $\Phi$ decay channel is to MSSM Higgses via the GM coupling. Using~\eqref{dw2}, we find:  
\begin{equation}
\label{phihh1}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_{\rm vis}\Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_{\rm vis}= 4\times\frac{Z^2}{2} \sqrt{1 - 4\,\frac{(\hat\mu^2+m_0^2)}{m_\Phi^2}} \simeq 2 Z^2\,.
\end{equation}
Plugging this value of $c_{\rm vis}$ together with $c_{\rm hid}=1$ (see~\eqref{ddr}) into the general expression~\eqref{dn} for extra dark radiation, we obtain the window:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1.53}{Z^2}\lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim  \frac{1.60}{Z^2}\,,
\label{MSSMpred}
\end{equation}
for $0.2 \, {\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 10 \, {\rm GeV}$. Clearly this gives values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ larger than unity for $Z = 1$. Using the bound~\eqref{cbound}, we see that we need $c_{\rm vis}\gtrsim 3$ in order to be consistent with present observational data, implying $Z\gtrsim \sqrt{3/2}\simeq 1.22$.

\subsubsection{Split SUSY-like case}
\label{splitsusycase}

Let us now analyse dark radiation predictions for split SUSY-like scenarios arising in the dS$_1$ (both local and ultra-local) and local dS$_2$ cases.
In these scenarios the hierarchy among soft-terms is (considering $\mu$ and $B\mu$-terms generated by $K$):
\begin{equation}
\label{hierarchyss}
M_{1/2}^2 \simeq \hat{\mu}^2 \sim \frac{M_P^2}{{V}^4} \ll m_0^2 \simeq B\hat\mu \simeq m_{\Phi}^2 \sim \frac{M_P^2}{{V}^3}\,.
\end{equation}
The main difference with the MSSM-like case is that now $B\hat\mu$ and $m_0^2$ scale as $m_\Phi^2$. In order to understand if volume modulus decays into SUSY scalars are kinematically allowed, i.e. $R~\equiv m^2_0/m_\Phi^2 \leq 1/4$, we need therefore to compute the exact value of $m_\Phi$ and compare it with the results derived in Sec.~\ref{Sec:m0}. It turns out that $m_\Phi$ depends on the dS mechanism as follows:
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_1: \,\, m_\Phi^2 = \frac{9}{8 a_s\tau_s} \frac{m_{3/2}^2\tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}} \qquad\qquad 
{\rm dS}_2: \,\, m_\Phi^2 = \frac{27}{4 a_s\tau_s} \frac{m_{3/2}^2\tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}\,.
\label{vmm}
\end{equation}
\newpage
Let us analyse each case separately:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Local and ultra-local dS$_1$ cases}: Even if the F-term contribution to scalar masses~\eqref{lsm} for the local case can be made small by appropriately tuning the coefficient $c_s$, the D-term contribution to $m_0^2$ given by~\eqref{ul1} cannot be tuned to small values once the requirement of a dS vacuum is imposed. Hence for both local and ultra-local cases, $m_0^2$ cannot be made smaller than~\eqref{ul1} giving:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2\geq 2 m_\Phi^2 \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad R \geq 2\,,
\end{equation}
which is clearly in contradiction with the condition $R\leq 1/4$ that has to be satisfied to open up the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars. Therefore 
the decay of $\Phi$ into squarks and sleptons is kinematically forbidden. 

\textit{Decay to Higgses}

Similarly to the MSSM-like case, $\Phi$ can still decay to Higgs bosons via the GM term in (\ref{finallagr}). Given that $m_\Phi< m_0$, when $\Phi$ decays at energies of order $m_\Phi$, EWSB has already taken place at the scale $m_0$.\footnote{As we shall show later on, RG flow effects do not modify these considerations qualitatively.} The gauge eigenstates $h_i$ $i=1,...,8$ given in~\eqref{fields} then get rotated into $8$ mass eigenstates. $4$ Higgs \textit{dof} which we denote by $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ remain heavy and acquire a mass of order $m_{H_d}^2 \simeq m_0^2$, and so the decay of $\Phi$ into these fields is kinematically forbidden. The remaining $4$ \textit{dof} are the $3$ would-be Goldstone bosons $G^0$ and $G^{\pm}$ which become the longitudinal components of $Z^0$ and $W^{\pm}$, and the ordinary SM Higgs field $h^0$. The $\Phi$ decay rate into light Higgs \textit{dof} can be obtained from the last term in~\eqref{finallagr} by writing the gauge eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates as \cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{eqnarray}
h_1 = {\rm Re} G^+ \sin\beta + {\rm Re} H^+ \cos\beta\,,&\qquad& h_2 = - {\rm Re} G^+ \cos\beta + {\rm Re} H^+ \sin\beta\,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_3 = \sqrt{2} v_d + h^0 \sin\beta + H^0 \cos \beta \,, &\qquad& h_4 = \sqrt{2} v_u + h^0 \cos\beta - H^0 \sin\beta \,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_5 = - G^0 \cos\beta\, + A^0 \sin \beta\,,&\qquad& h_6 = G^0 \sin\beta\, + A^0 \cos \beta\,, \nonumber\\ \\
h_7 = {\rm Im} G^+ \sin\beta + {\rm Im} H^+ \cos \beta\,,&\qquad& h_8 = {\rm Im} G^+ \cos\beta - {\rm Im} H^+ \sin\beta\,,
\label{gauge-mass}
\end{eqnarray}
where $v_u \equiv \langle H^0_u \rangle$, $v_d \equiv \langle H^0_d \rangle$ and $\tan \beta~\equiv v_u/v_d$. Since in split SUSY-like models $\tan \beta \sim {O}(1)$ in order to reproduce the correct Higgs mass \cite{Giudice:2011cg, Bagnaschi:2014rsa}, the interaction Lagrangian simplifies to:
\begin{eqnarray}
{L}_{\rm cubic} &\supset& \frac{Z}{2\sqrt{6}}\, \frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_P} \, 
\hat\Phi \left[\left(h^0\right)^2+\left(G^0\right)^2+\left({\rm Re}G^+\right)^2+\left({\rm Im} G^+\right)^2 - \right. \nonumber\\ \\
&&\left.- \left(A^0\right)^2 - \left(H^0\right)^2 - \left({\rm Re}H^+\right)^2 - \left({\rm Im}H^+\right)^2\right]\,.
\label{ewsbint}
\end{eqnarray}
Neglecting interaction terms involving heavy Higgses, (\ref{ewsbint}) gives a decay rate of the form:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh,GG}=d_1 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad d_1 \simeq 4\times\frac{Z^2}{4}\simeq Z^2\,.
\end{equation}
\newpage
\textit{Decay to Higgsinos}

$\Phi$ can also decay to Higgsinos via the interaction Lagrangian (\ref{higgsinocubic}). We need only to check if this decay is kinematically allowed. In split SUSY-like models EWSB takes place at the scale $m_0$ where the following relations hold:
\begin{equation}
\hat\mu^2 = \frac{m_{H_d}^2 - m_{H_u}^2 \tan^2 \beta}{\tan^2 \beta - 1} - \frac{m_Z^2}{2}\,, \qquad \quad \sin\left(2 \beta\right) = \frac{2 |B \hat\mu|}{m_{H_d}^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + 2 \hat\mu^2}\,.
\label{ewsb}
\end{equation}
In the case of universal boundary conditions for the Higgs masses, i.e. $m_{H_u}=m_{H_d}=m_0$ at the GUT scale, the $\hat\mu$-term has necessarily to be of order the scalar masses $m_0$ since for $\tan \beta \sim \mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$ the first EWSB condition in (\ref{ewsb}) simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\hat\mu^2 \simeq \frac{m_{H_d}^2}{\tan^2 \beta - 1} \simeq m_0^2 \,,
\label{ewsb2}
\end{equation}
given that $m_{H_u}^2$ runs down to values smaller than $m_{H_d}^2$ due to RG flow effects. On the other hand, $\hat\mu$ could be much smaller than $m_0$ for non-universal boundary conditions, i.e. if $m_{H_u} \neq m_{H_d}$ at the GUT scale. In fact, in split SUSY models $m_{H_u}^2$ is positive around the scale $m_0$, and so the first EWSB condition in (\ref{ewsb}) for $\hat\mu \ll m_0$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
m_{H_d}^2 \simeq m_{H_u}^2 \tan^2 \beta \,.
\end{equation}
This condition can be satisfied at the scale $m_0$ for a proper choice of boundary conditions at the GUT scale with $m_{H_u}>m_{H_d}$. 
Let us point out that, if $\hat\mu$ is determined by K\"ahler potential contributions as in (\ref{bmu}), $\hat\mu$ is suppressed with respect to $m_0$ but, if $\hat\mu$ is generated by non-perturbative effects in $W$, $\hat\mu$ can be of order $m_0$. In this case, the parametrisation of the $\hat\mu$-term (\ref{stexp}) reproduces the correct $\tau_b$-dependence of the non-perturbatively induced $\hat\mu$-term (\ref{mubmu}) if $\alpha = 3 n + 1$.\footnote{If the instanton number is $n = 1$, the $\hat\mu$-term can easily be of order $m_\Phi$ since $c_{\mu,W}$ is a flux-dependent tunable coefficient. For example, setting $\xi = a_s = 1$ and $g_s = 0.1$, the requirement $\hat{\mu} \simeq m_\Phi$ implies that $c_{\mu,W} \simeq W_0/(4\,{V}^{1/6})$. For $W_0 \simeq 10$ and ${V} \simeq 10^7$ we get $c_{\mu,W} \simeq 0.2$.} If we parameterise the ratio between $\hat\mu$ and $m_{\Phi}$ as $\tilde{c} \equiv \hat\mu/m_\Phi$, the decay of $\Phi$ into Higgsinos is kinematically allowed only for $\tilde{c} \leq 1/2$. Using (\ref{higgsinosdr}), this decay rate takes the form (where we set $n = 1\,\Leftrightarrow\,\alpha = 4$):
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}} = d_2 \Gamma_0 \qquad\text{with}\qquad d_2 \simeq 8 \tilde{c}^2 \left(1 - 4 \tilde{c}^2\right)^{3/2}\,.
\label{higgsinogamma}
\end{equation}

\textit{Dark radiation prediction}

Plugging $c_{\rm vis} = d_1 + d_2$ into~\eqref{dn} with $c_{\rm hid}=1$ we get the following general result:
\begin{equation}
\frac{3.07}{Z^2 + d_2}\lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim  \frac{3.20}{Z^2 + d_2}\,.
\label{dS1pred}
\end{equation}
Considering $\tilde{c} = 1/\sqrt{10}$ which maximises $d_2 \simeq 0.37$ we find that for $0.2 \, {\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 10 \, {\rm GeV}$ this prediction yields values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ larger than unity for $Z = 1$. Consistency with present observational data, i.e. $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$, requires $Z\gtrsim 1.68$.

\item \emph{Local dS$_2$ case}: The situation seems more promising in this case since in the local limit the D-term contribution to $m_0^2$ is volume-suppressed with respect to $m_\Phi^2$ since it scales as $\left. m_0^2\right|_D \sim {O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$ \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}. In this case it is therefore possible to tune the coefficient $c_s$ to obtain $R\leq 1/4$. By comparing the second term in~\eqref{vmm} with~\eqref{lsm}, this implies that $c_s$ has to be tuned so that $\left(c_s - \frac 13\right) \leq \frac{9}{10 \, a_s \tau_s}$, where $a_s \tau_s \sim 80$ in order to get TeV-scale gaugino masses \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}. However the condition $m_0^2 > 0$ to avoid tachyonic masses translates into $\left(c_s - \frac 13\right)>0$, giving rise to a very small window: 
\begin{equation}
0 < \left( c_s- \frac 13 \right) \leq \frac{9}{10 \, a_s \tau_s} \simeq 0.01\,.
\end{equation}
Given that $c_s$ should be extremely fine-tuned, it seems very unlikely to open this decay channel. However the total K\"ahler potential, 
on top of pure $\alpha'$ corrections, can also receive perturbative string loop corrections of the form \cite{Berg:2007wt}:
\begin{equation}
K_{\rm loop} = \frac{g_s C_{\rm loop}}{{V}^{2/3}}\left(1+ k_{\rm loop}\sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_b}}\right)\,,
\label{Kloop}
\end{equation}
where $C_{\rm loop}$ and $k_{\rm loop}$ are two ${O}(1)$ coefficients which depend on the complex structure moduli. Due to the \textit{extended no-scale structure} \cite{extendednoscale}, $g_s$ effects do not modify the leading order scalar potential, and so the mass of the volume modulus is still given by~\eqref{vmm}. However, in order to reproduce a correct ultra-local limit~\eqref{ul}, we need to change the parametrisation of the K\"ahler matter metric from~\eqref{Ktilde} to:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K} = \frac{1}{{V}^{2/3}} \left(1 - c_s \frac{\hat{\xi}}{{V}} - c_{\rm loop} \frac{g_s C_{\rm loop}}{{V}^{2/3}} \right),
\label{newKtilde}
\end{equation}
where we introduced a new coefficient $c_{\rm loop}$ and we neglected $k_{\rm loop}$-dependent corrections in~\eqref{Kloop} since they are subdominant in the large volume limit $\tau_s\ll\tau_b$. The new ultra-local limit is now given by $c_s = c_{\rm loop} = 1/3$. 

These new $c_{\rm loop}$-dependent corrections in~\eqref{newKtilde} affect the final result for scalar masses and can therefore open up the $\Phi$ decay channel to SUSY scalars. In fact, the result~\eqref{lsm} for scalar masses in the local case gets modified to: 
\begin{equation}
\left.m_0^2\right|_F = \frac{15}{2}\, \frac{m_{3/2}^2 \tau_s^{3/2}}{{V}}
\left[\left(c_s-\frac{1}{3}\right) - \frac{8 g_s C_{\rm loop}}{15} \left(c_{\rm loop} - \frac 13\right)
\frac{{V}^{1/3}}{\hat\xi}\right] \,.
\label{newlsm}
\end{equation}
The two terms in square brackets are of the same order for $g_s\simeq 0.1$ and ${V} \sim 10^7$ which is needed to get TeV-scale gauginos, and so they can compete to get $R \leq \frac 14$. As an illustrative example, if we choose $c_s = 1/3$ and natural values of the other parameters: $C_{\rm loop} = a_s = 1$, $\xi = 2$ and $c_{\rm loop} = 0$ (non-tachyonic scalars require $c_{\rm loop} < 1/3$ for $c_s = 1/3$), the ratio between squared masses becomes:
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{8}{81}\, g_s^{3/2}\,{V}^{1/3}\,.
\end{equation}
As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{psf}, there is now a wide region of the parameter space where the $\Phi$ decay to SUSY scalars is allowed.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, angle=0]{Fig1.eps}
\caption{The green region in the ($g_s$, ${V}$) parameter space gives $R \leq 1/4$, and so the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars is kinematically allowed.} 
\label{psf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We finally point out that $g_s$ corrections to the K\"ahler matter metric affect the result for scalar masses only in the local case since in the ultra-local limit $m_0$ is generated by effects (D-terms for dS$_1$ and F-terms of $S$ and $U$-moduli for dS$_2$) which are sensitive only to the leading order expression of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
Let us now analyse the final prediction for dark radiation production for split SUSY-like models where the decay channel of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars is kinematically allowed.

\subsubsection*{Dark radiation results}
\label{drresults}

We start by parameterising the scalar mass $m_0$ in terms of the volume mode mass $m_\Phi$ as $m_0 = c \,m_\Phi$ and the $\hat\mu$-term as $\mu = \tilde{c}\,m_\Phi$ so that the corresponding kinematic constraints for $\Phi$ decays into SUSY scalars and Higgsinos become $c \leq \frac 12$ and $\tilde{c}\leq \frac 12$.
Parameterising also the $B\hat\mu$-term as in (\ref{bmu}) and using the fact that for split SUSY-like models we have in (\ref{stexp}) $\beta = \gamma = 9/2$ and $\alpha = 4$,\footnote{We focus on the case where the $\hat\mu$-term is generated by non-perturbative effects in $W$ since when $\hat\mu$ is generated by $K$, it turns out to be very suppressed with respect to $m_0$, i.e. $\tilde{c}\ll 1$, and so it gives rise to a negligible contribution to the branching ratio of $\Phi$.} the leading order cubic Lagrangian is given by the sum of (\ref{finallagr}) and (\ref{higgsinocubic}):
\begin{eqnarray}
{L}_{\rm cubic} &\simeq& \frac{7 c^2}{2\sqrt{6}}\frac{m_\Phi^2}{M_P} \hat\Phi\left[  
\sigma^\alpha\sigma_\alpha + \chi^\alpha\chi_\alpha+\left(1+\frac{6\tilde{c}^2}{7 c^2}\right)h_i h^i+ 2Z  \left(c_{B,K}  - \frac{1}{7 c^2} \right) \sum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1}h_{2i-1}h_{2i}\right] \nonumber\\ \\
&+& \tilde{c}\sqrt{\frac 23} \, \frac{m_\Phi}{M_p}\hat\Phi \left(\tilde{H}_u^+\tilde{H}_d^- -\tilde{H}_u^0\tilde{H}_d^0\right)+\text{h.c.}.
\label{intlagr}
\end{eqnarray}
Contrary to the MSSM-like case, now the decay of the volume modulus into squarks and sleptons through mass terms is kinematically allowed and also the decay rate into Higgses is enhanced due to mass terms and $B\hat\mu$ couplings. Using~\eqref{dw1}, the total decay rate into squarks and sleptons reads:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} = c_0 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_0 = N\times \frac{49 \, c^4}{4} \sqrt{1 - 4 c^2}\,, 
\end{equation}
where $N=90$ is the number of real scalar \textit{dof} of the MSSM,\footnote{$12$ \textit{dof} for each left handed squark doublet ($3$ families), $6$ \textit{dof} for each right handed squark ($6$ squarks), $4$ \textit{dof} for each left handed slepton doublet ($3$ families), $2$ \textit{dof} for each right handed slepton ($3$ families).} except for the Higgses.

On the other hand, the decay rate into Higgs bosons receives contributions from both mass and GM terms. Using~\eqref{dw1} we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\rm (mass)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_1 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_1 = 8 \times \frac{49 \, c^4}{4} \left(1+\frac{2\tilde{c}^2}{7 c^2}\right)^2\sqrt{1 - 4 (c^2+\tilde{c}^2)}\,, 
\end{equation}
where $8$ is the number of MSSM real Higgs \textit{dof} while using (\ref{bmu}) and (\ref{dw2}) we get:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = c_2 \Gamma_0\qquad\text{with}\qquad c_2 = 4\times\frac{Z^2}{2} \left(7 c_{B,K} c^2  - 1 \right)^2 \sqrt{1 - 4\,c^2}\,.
\end{equation}
The decay rate into Higgsinos is given again by~\eqref{higgsinogamma} and thus the total $\Phi$ decay rate into visible sector fields becomes:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\rm vis} = \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi}+\Gamma^{\rm (mass)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh}+\Gamma^{\rm (GM)}_{\Phi \rightarrow hh}+\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H}\tilde{H}}= c_{\rm vis} \Gamma_0 \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{where}\qquad c_{\rm vis} = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + d_2 \,.
\end{equation}
The final prediction for dark radiation production is then given by~\eqref{dn} with $c_{\rm hid}=1$, $g_*(T_{\rm dec}) = 10.75$ and $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 86.25$ for $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 0.7\,{\rm GeV}$.\footnote{The results do not change significantly for $g_*(T_{\rm rh}) = 75.75$ which is valid for $0.2\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh} \lesssim 0.7\, {\rm GeV}$.} The results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{ris1} where we have set $c_{B,K}=1$, $Z = 1$ and we are considering a conservative case in which the decay into Higgsinos is negligible, i.e. $\tilde{c} = 0$. For $c>0.2$, the vast majority of the parameter space yields $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1$, in perfect agreement with present experimental bounds with a minimum value $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min} \simeq 0.14$ at $c \simeq 1/\sqrt{5}$.

It is interesting to notice that, contrary to the MSSM-like case, dark radiation overprodution can now be avoided if the GM term is absent or it is very suppressed. In fact even for $Z=0$, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1$ if $c\gtrsim 0.23$, as a consequence of the fact that in this region of the parameter space almost the whole suppression of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is due to the decay into scalar fields. The predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ for different values of the GM coupling $Z = 0$ (blue line), $Z = 1$ (red line) and $Z = 2$ (green line) are shown in Fig.~\ref{z123}. 

For $\tilde{c} \neq 0$ $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is even further suppressed than what is shown in Fig.~\ref{ris1} and~\ref{z123} but the correction is at the percent level in the interesting region where the decay into scalars dominates $\Gamma_{\rm vis}$. For example including the effect of decays into Higgsinos and setting $\tilde{c} \simeq 1/\sqrt{10}$ to maximise the decay rate into Higgsinos, the correction $\left.\delta \Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}$ to $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}$ turns out to be:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\left.\delta \Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}}{\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min}} \simeq 0.03 \,.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{ris1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Note that $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can be further suppressed by choosing $c_{B,K} > 1$, namely by enhancing the contribution due to the $B\hat\mu$-term. However 
the decay scale $m_\Phi$ is just slightly larger than the EWSB scale $m_0$ where the $4$ \textit{dof} of the two Higgs doublets get rotated into the heavy Higgs mass eigenstates $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$, the SM Higgs $h^0$ and the longitudinal components $G^0, G^\pm$ of the vector bosons $Z, W^\pm$. Hence the $B\hat\mu$-term gets reabsorbed into the mass terms for $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ and $h^0, G^0, G^\pm$, and so varying $c_{B,K}$ does not enhance $\Gamma_{\rm vis}$ which receives its main contributions from the decay into squarks, sleptons and heavy Higgses through the mass term (assuming that is kinematically allowed) and into all Higgs \textit{dof} via the GM term. These considerations will become more clear in the next section where we will take into account corrections due to RG flow effects. A possible way-out could be the separation between the EWSB scale and the volume modulus mass, which translates into requiring $c \ll 1$. However this choice would imply $m_0^2 \ll m_\Phi^2 \sim B\hat\mu$ which would be a quite unnatural situation from a top-down perspective since $m_\Phi$ and $m_0$ have the same volume scaling.

\subsubsection*{RG flow effects}
\label{rgflows}

The results obtained above have to be corrected due to RG flow effects from the string scale to the actual scale $m_\Phi$ where the modulus decay takes place \cite{DRloop}. However these corrections do not alter qualitatively our results since $\Phi$ interacts only gravitationally and the running of squarks and sleptons in split SUSY models is almost absent \cite{Bagnaschi:2014rsa}. For sake of completeness, let us study these RG flow effects in detail. 

The soft-terms $m_0$, $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ entering in the interaction Lagrangian~\eqref{finallagr} are just boundary conditions for the RG flow and should instead be evaluated at the scale $m_\Phi$ where the light modulus $\Phi$ decays. The RG equations for the first and second generation of squarks and sleptons are given by:
\begin{equation}
m^2_\alpha = m_0^2 + \sum_{a=1}^3 c_{\alpha,a} K_a\,,
\end{equation}
where $c_{\alpha,a}$ is the weak hypercharge squared for each SUSY scalar and the RG running contributions $K_a$ are proportional 
to gaugino masses \cite{Martin:1997ns}. Given that in split SUSY-like models gaugino masses are hierarchically lighter than scalar masses, 
the RG running of first and second generation squarks and sleptons is a negligible effect. Thus we can consider their mass at the scale $m_\Phi$ as still given by $m_0$ to a high level of accuracy. 

The situation for the third generation is slightly trickier since there are additional contributions from large Yukawa couplings. Using mSUGRA boundary conditions, the relevant RG equations become (ignoring contributions proportional to $M_{1/2}$) \cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{equation}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{Q_3}^2 = X_t + X_b\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{u}_3}^2 = 2 X_t\,,
\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{d}_3}^2 = 2 X_b\,,
\label{RG1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{L_3}^2 = X_\tau\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{e}_3}^2 = 2 X_\tau\,,
\label{RG2}
\end{equation}
which are coupled to those involving Higgs masses:
\begin{equation}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_u}^2 = 3 X_t + X_b\,,\qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_d}^2 = 3 X_b + X_\tau\,.
\label{RG3}
\end{equation}
The quantities $X_i$ look like:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{xi1}
& X_t = 2 |y_t|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{Q_3}^2 + m_{\overline{u}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_t|^2\,, & \\
\label{xi2}
& X_b = 2 |y_b|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{Q_3}^2 + m_{\overline{d}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_b|^2\,, & \\
\label{xi3}
& X_\tau = 2 |y_\tau|^2 \left(m_{H_u}^2 + m_{L_3}^2 + m_{\overline{e}_3}^2\right) + 2 |a_\tau|^2\,, &
\end{eqnarray}
where $y_i$ are the Yukawa couplings and $a_i$ are the only sizable entries of the $A$-term couplings. Given that for sequestered scenarios the $A$-terms scale as $M_{1/2}$ \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}, the contribution $2 |a_i|^2$ can be neglected with respect to the first term in each $X_i$. Moreover $X_t$, $X_b$ and $X_\tau$ are all positive, and so the RG equations~\eqref{RG1} and~\eqref{RG2} drive the scalar masses to smaller values at lower energies. This has a two-fold implication:
\begin{itemize}
\item When $m_0 > m_\Phi$, RG running effects could lower $m_0$ to values smaller than $m_\Phi/2$ so that the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up at the scale $m_\Phi$. However this never happens since RG effects are negligible.

\item When $m_0 \leq m_\Phi/2$, no one of the scalars becomes heavier than the volume modulus if $R < \frac 14$ at the boundary energy scale. On the other hand, RG running effects could still lower the scalar masses too much, suppressing the $\Phi$ decay rate to SUSY scalars. However this does not happen since RG effects are negligible.
\end{itemize}
In split SUSY-like models a correct radiative realisation of EWSB requires a low value of $\tan \beta$ \cite{Bagnaschi:2014rsa}, which implies $y_b,\,y_\tau\ll y_t$. In turn, $X_b$ and $X_\tau$ give rise to a tiny effect, and so the running of $m_{H_d}^2$, $m_{\overline{d}_3}^2$, $m_{L_3}^2$ and $m_{\overline{e}_3}^2$ turns out to be negligible. In the end, the only relevant RG equations become:
\begin{equation}
16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{Q_3}^2 \simeq X_t\,, \qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{\overline{u}_3}^2 \simeq 2 X_t\,, \qquad 16 \pi^2 \frac{d}{dt} m_{H_u}^2 = 3 X_t\,.
\end{equation}

We performed a numerical computation of the RG running, using as boundary conditions $m_0 = B\hat\mu^{1/2} = \hat\mu = 10^7 \, \rm GeV$ and $M_a = 10^3 \, \rm GeV$ at the GUT scale $M_{\rm GUT} = 2 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $\tan \beta \simeq 1.4$. We also used that the stop left-right mixing is given by $\chi_t = A_t - \hat\mu \cot \beta \simeq - m_0/{\tan \beta}$, being $A_t \simeq M_{1/2} \ll m_0$. We used SusyHD \cite{Vega:2015fna} to run the Yukawa couplings from the top mass scale up to $m_0$ combined with SARAH \cite{Staub:2008uz} to run them from $m_0$ up to the GUT scale.\footnote{We are grateful to J. P. Vega for useful discussions about this point.} These runnings have been computed at order one loop. Using the values of the Yukawa couplings obtained at the GUT scale, we have been able to compute the running of scalars, $\hat\mu$, $B\hat\mu$ and the GM coupling $Z$ down to the scale of the decay $m_\Phi$. Fig.~\ref{scr} shows the running of scalar masses while Fig.~\ref{hr} showns the running of $m_{H_u}^2$ and $m_{H_d}^2$. The running of $\hat\mu$ and $B\hat\mu$ is almost negligible. We clarify that our purpose here is not to study EWSB in full detail but to understand which kind of behaviour we should expect for the running of soft-terms from the GUT scale to $m_\Phi$ using boundary conditions which are consistent with EWSB.

\caption{Running of the Higgs masses.}\label{hr}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Due to RG running effects each of the scalars has a different mass at the scale $m_\Phi$, and so the exact prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
\Delta N_{\rm eff} = \frac{43}{7} \mathcal{R} \left(\frac{g_* (T_{\rm decay})}{g_*(T_{\rm reheat})}\right)^{1/3} \,,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
{R} = \frac{\Gamma_0}{\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} + \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} + \Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}}}\,.
\end{equation}
The decay rate into squarks and sleptons is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{gs}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \sigma\sigma,\chi\chi} = \frac{49}{4} \sum_\alpha \, \kappa_\alpha \left(\frac{m_\alpha}{m_\Phi}\right)^4 \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_\alpha}{m_\Phi}\right)^2}\Gamma_0\,,
\end{equation}
where the index $\alpha$ runs over all squarks and sleptons $m_\alpha = \left( m_{\tilde{Q}_{\rm L}}, m_{\tilde{u}_R}, m_{\tilde{d}_R}, m_{\tilde{L}}, m_{\tilde{e}_{\rm R}}\right)$ while $\kappa_\alpha$ is the number of \textit{dof} for each scalar.\footnote{It turns out that $\kappa_\alpha = \left(36, 18, 18, 12, 6\right)$.}

On the other hand the decay rate into Higgs \textit{dof} is given by (we focus on the case where $\hat\mu\ll m_0$ since, as we have seen in the previous section, a large $\hat\mu$-term gives rise just to a negligible correction to the final dark radiation prediction):
\begin{equation}
\label{gh}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow hh} = \left[\sum_{I \in \{A^0, H^0, H^\pm\}} \left(49 \left(\frac{m_{I}}{m_{\Phi}} \right)^4 + Z^2 \right) \sqrt{1 - 4 \left(\frac{m_{I}}{m_{\Phi}}\right)^2} + Z^2\right]\Gamma_0\, .
\end{equation}
All quantities in (\ref{gs}) and (\ref{gh}) have to be computed at the decay scale $m_\Phi$. As already explained in the previous section, $B\hat\mu$ does not explicitly contribute to (\ref{gh}) since it gets reabsorbed into the Higgs masses due to EWSB. The decay of $\Phi$ into heavy Higgses $A^0, H^0, H^\pm$ through the mass term can instead contribute to $\Gamma_{\rm Higgs}$, provided that $m_{A^0, H^0, H^\pm}/m_\Phi \leq 1/2$. The mass of the heavy Higgses in the limit $m_Z, m_{W^\pm} \ll m_{A^0}$ can be written as \cite{Martin:1997ns}:
\begin{equation}
m_{H^0}^2 \simeq m_{H^\pm}^2 \simeq m_{A^0}^2 \simeq 2 |\hat\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + m_{H_d}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
The decay rate into Higgsinos instead reads:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\Phi \rightarrow \tilde{H} \tilde{H}} = 8 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2 \left(1 - 4 \left(\frac{\hat\mu}{m_\Phi}\right)^2\right)^{3/2} \Gamma_0 \,,
\label{higgsinodecayrg}
\end{equation}
where we added the two contributions in~\eqref{higgsinosdr} and we used $\alpha = 4$. In~\eqref{higgsinodecayrg} $\hat\mu/m_\Phi \neq \tilde{c}$, since $\hat\mu$ is computed at the decay scale $m_\Phi$.

We computed $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ for different values of $m_\Phi$, keeping the boundary conditions fixed at $m_0 = B\hat\mu^{1/2} = \hat\mu = 10^7 \, \rm GeV$ and $M_a = 10^3$ GeV. The qualitative behaviour of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is the same as in the previous section where RG flow effects have been ignored. The results are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab1} which shows that the dominant contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is given by the decay into squarks and sleptons while the suppression coming from decay into Higgsinos is always subdominant. If $m_\Phi \simeq 2.2 \times 10^7 \, \rm GeV$, corresponding to $m_0/m_\Phi \simeq 1/\sqrt{5}$, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.15$ which is only slightly larger then $\left.\Delta N_{\rm eff}\right|_{\rm min} = 0.14$ computed in the previous section without taking into account RG flow effects. This is due to the fact that the running of the SUSY scalars is negligible as can be clearly seen from Fig.~\ref{scr}.

We also indicate the relative importance of the various decay channels. In the case denoted by a $(*)$ the only non-vanishing contribution to $\Gamma_{\rm Higgs}$ is due to the decay into light Higgs \textit{dof} through the GM coupling, since the decay into heavy Higgs \textit{dof} turns out to be kinematically forbidden as a consequence of the RG flow: $2 m_{A^0, H^0, H^\pm} > m_\Phi$ at the decay scale $m_\Phi$. The decay into Higgsinos is always a subleading effect.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

Extra dark radiation is a very promising window for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Its presence is a generic feature of string models where some of the moduli are stabilised by perturbative effects since the corresponding axionic partners remain very light and can behave as extra neutrino-like species \cite{DMDRcorr}. These light hidden sector \textit{dof} are produced by the decay of the lightest modulus \cite{NTDM, NonThDMinSeqLVS} leading to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\neq 0$ \cite{DR1, DR2, AxionProbl}. 

In this paper we performed a general analysis of axionic dark radiation production in sequestered LVS models where the visible sector is localised on D3-branes at singularities \cite{Aldazabal:2000sa, Conlon:2008wa, CYembedding}. These models yield a very interesting post-inflationary cosmological history where reheating is driven by the decay of the lightest modulus $\Phi$ with a mass of order $m_\Phi\sim 10^7$ GeV which leads to a reheating temperature of order $T_{\rm rh}\sim 1$ GeV. The gravitino mass is much larger than $m_\Phi$ ($m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$ GeV), so avoiding any gravitino problem \cite{gravProbl}. Low-energy SUSY can still be achieved due to sequestering effects that keep the supersymmetric partners light. Gauginos are around the TeV-scale whereas squarks and sleptons can either be as light as the gauginos or as heavy as the lightest modulus $\Phi$ depending on the moduli dependence of the matter K\"ahler metric and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum \cite{SoftTermsSeqLVS}. 

The final prediction for dark radiation production due to the decay of the volume modulus into ultra-light bulk closed string axions depends on the details of the visible sector construction:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{MSSM-like case}: \\
MSSM-like models arise from the ultra-local dS$_2$ case where the leading visible sector decay channel of $\Phi$ is to Higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. The simplest model with two Higgs doublets and $Z=1$ gives $1.53 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1.60$ for $500\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 5\,{\rm GeV}$ \cite{DR1, DR2}. Values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ smaller than unity require $Z\gtrsim 1.22$ or more than two Higgs doublets.

\item \textit{Split SUSY-like case with $m_0> m_\Phi/2$}: \\
Local and ultra-local dS$_1$ cases give rise to split SUSY-like scenarios where scalar masses $m_0$ receive a contribution from D-terms which cannot be made smaller than $m_\Phi/2$. Thus the decay of $\Phi$ into squarks and sleptons is kinematically forbidden. The leading visible sector decay channel of $\Phi$ is again to Higgses via the GM coupling $Z$. However, given that EWSB takes place at the scale $m_0$ which in these cases is larger than the decay scale $m_\Phi$, the volume mode $\Phi$ can decay only to the 4 light Higgs \textit{dof}. For a shift-symmetric Higgs sector with $Z=1$, the final prediction for dark radiation production is $3.07 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 3.20$. Consistency with present experimental data, i.e. $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\lesssim 1$, requires $Z\gtrsim 1.68$. In most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like models a correct radiative EWSB can be achieved only if the $\hat\mu$-term is of order the scalar masses. Hence, depending on the exact value of $\hat\mu$, the decay of $\Phi$ into Higgsinos could not be mass suppressed. However it gives rise just to a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.

\item \textit{Split SUSY-like case with $m_0\leq m_\Phi/2$}: \\
Given that in the local dS$_2$ case the D-term contribution to scalar masses is negligible, the decay of $\Phi$ into SUSY scalars can become kinematically allowed. In fact, thanks to the inclusion of string loop corrections to the K\"ahler potential \cite{Berg:2007wt, extendednoscale}, a large region of the underlying parameter space features $m_0\leq m_\Phi/2$. Hence the final prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ gets considerably reduced with respect to the previous two cases since, in addition to decays into Higgses via the GM term, leading order contributions to the branching ratio to visible sector particles involve decays into squarks and sleptons, decays into heavy Higgses induced by mass terms and possible decays into Higgsinos depending on the exact value of the $\hat\mu$-term. Depending on the exact value of $m_0$, the simplest model with $Z=1$ gives $0.14 \lesssim \Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 1.6$. Hence these models feature values of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in perfect agreement with present observational bounds. Note that dark radiation overproduction can be avoided even for $Z=0$ due to the new decay channels to squarks and sleptons.
\end{enumerate}

We finally studied corrections to these results due to RG flow effects from the string scale $M_s \sim 10^{15}$ GeV to the volume mode mass $m_\Phi\sim 10^7$ GeV where the actual decay takes place. However these corrections do not modify our predictions since the RG running of SUSY scalar masses is a negligible effect in split SUSY-like models and radiative corrections to $m_\Phi$ are tiny since moduli are only gravitational coupled.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe still remains a mystery to be unraveled~\cite{BAU}. Most current approaches are based on mechanisms that rely on relatively high reheating temperatures $T_{\rm rh}$. For example, thermal leptogenesis~\cite{lepto} requires $T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ GeV while electroweak baryogenesis~\cite{EW} demands $T_{\rm rh} \gtrsim 1$ TeV. 

However, supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model (SM) and their string theory embeddings typically have moduli fields that alter the standard thermal history of the universe~\cite{ksw}. The moduli, due to their gravitational coupling to matter, are long-lived and tend to dominate the energy density of the universe before decaying. The late-time decay of the moduli typically gives rise to reheating temperatures well below the electroweak scale, particularly in models with low-energy SUSY. The moduli decay also releases a huge amount of entropy that dilutes any pre-existing relic abundance, thereby necessitating the production of dark matter (DM) and the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) at relatively low temperatures. 

An interesting class of string compactifications is type IIB sequestered string models with D3-branes at singularities \cite{SingD3s}. These models have been explicitly embedded in globally consistent Calabi-Yau (CY) compactifications with de Sitter (dS) closed string moduli stabilisation \cite{CYembedding}. Moreover, they can yield low-energy SUSY without introducing any cosmological moduli problem \cite{CMP} or gravitino overproduction problem \cite{gravProbl}, and provide a promising framework for building inflationary models in agreement with Planck data where the inflaton is a K\"ahler modulus \cite{InflReview}. 

In the context of the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) \cite{LVS}, all sequestered models share a universal feature: the overall volume mode is the lightest modulus $\chi$. Its mass is suppressed with respect to the gravitino mass: $m_\chi \sim m_{3/2}\,\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon \sim m_{3/2}/M_p \ll 1$. On the other hand gaugino masses scale as $M\sim m_{3/2}\,\epsilon$ while scalar masses can behave as either $m_0 \sim M$ or $m_0 \sim m_\chi$ \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk,Aparicio:2014wxa} depending on the exact form of the K\"ahler metric for matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a dS vacuum. Thus sequestered scenarios can give rise to both MSSM-like and split SUSY-like models. TeV-scale gaugino masses can be obtained 
for $m_{3/2}\sim 10^{10}$-$10^{11}$ GeV and $m_\chi \sim 10^{6}$-$10^{7}$ GeV. The decay of $\chi$ typically gives rise to a reheating temperature of order $T_{\rm rh}\sim m_\chi \sqrt{m_\chi/M_p} \sim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV. 

A promising mechanism for generating the observed value of BAU in models with reheating temperatures below the EW scale is Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis~\cite{Affleck:1984fy}. This scenario utilizes a SUSY D-flat direction that carries a non-zero baryon number, the so-called AD field. If the AD field develops a sufficiently large displacement from its late-time minimum during inflation, its post-inflationary dynamics can generate a baryon asymmetry that can survive the entropy release during the final stage of reheating. However, a successful embedding of AD baryogenesis in supergravity models is non-trivial as supergravity corrections can ruin the flatness of the potential for the AD field, thereby preventing it from acquiring a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation.         

In this paper, we show that BAU can be successfully generated in sequestered models via AD mechanism. In particular, we shall outline how to construct a model where one can follow the whole cosmological evolution of the universe from inflation to the final stage of reheating by decay of the lightest modulus which successfully generates the observed BAU along with the correct DM relic abundance. The highlights of the scenario are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Small-field inflation takes place in the closed string sector where a blow-up modulus $\sigma$ drives the exponential expansion of the universe 
in agreement with Planck data \cite{Conlon:2005jm}. Generating density perturbations with the correct amplitude raises all the mass scales mentioned above by about two orders of magnitude, which results in gaugino masses in the range $M \sim 10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ GeV. 

\item If the K\"ahler metric for matter fields has an appropriate dependence on $\sigma$, in split SUSY-like models squarks and sleptons can become tachyonic during inflation. The AD field $\phi$ can then develop a sufficiently large non-zero VEV during inflation. Moreover also the volume mode $\chi$ is shifted from its late-time minimum during inflation. 

\item At the end of inflation, the inflaton becomes very heavy since $m_\sigma \sim m_{3/2}$ and its decay leads to an initial stage of reheating with a relatively high temperature. When the Hubble constant $H$ drops to $m_\phi \sim m_\chi$, both $\phi$ and $\chi$ start oscillating around their late-time minima. The SUSY breaking A-terms induce a rotational motion of the AD field and the generation of baryon asymmetry that gets transferred to quarks when $\phi$ decays.

\item Given that $\chi$ is only gravitationally coupled, it decays after $\phi$ and dilutes any previously produced relic abundance.
The final reheating temperature is $T_{\rm rh}\sim 10^{2}$-$10^{4}$ GeV, which is high enough to allow thermal Higgsino-like DM with a mass around $1$ TeV. The observed BAU can be obtained for natural initial displacements of the AD field $\phi$ of order $0.1\,M_p$.
\end{itemize}

We would like to emphasize that the sequestered model in this paper represents an explicit example where one can check in detail the viability of the main assumption underlying the AD mechanism for baryogenesis, i.e. the dynamical generation of a tachyonic mass during inflation. In fact, this class of models show an interesting interplay between inflation, SUSY breaking, soft terms, baryogenesis and DM within the same string compactification. 

The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec:ADreview}, we briefly review AD baryogenesis and the present constraints for its embedding in a supergravity framework. In Sec. \ref{SecSeqLVS}, we give an overview of all the main features of sequestered LVS models like the structure of the 4D effective field theory, moduli stabilisation, SUSY breaking and the spectrum of soft terms. In Sec. \ref{sec:dynamics}, we describe the full cosmological evolution in our scenario including inflation, reheating and generation of BAU via the AD mechanism. Finally, we present and discuss our numerical results in Sec. \ref{SecResults} before concluding in Sec. \ref{Concl}.


\section{Review of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis}
\label{sec:ADreview}

\subsection{Basic mechanism}

The field space of SUSY extensions of the SM contains many directions along which the D-term contributions to the scalar
potential identically vanish. These D-flat directions are parameterised by gauge invariant monomials of the chiral superfields~\cite{Dine:1995kz,gkm}. 
They are lifted by SUSY breaking terms and superpotential terms of the form $\lambda_n {\Phi}^n/n \Lambda^{n-3}$. Here $n \geq 3$, $\Lambda$ is the scale of new physics (typically Planck or string scale), and $\Phi$ is the superfield comprising the flat direction $\phi$ and its fermionic partner. 

In general, both the low-energy SUSY breaking and SUSY breaking by the non-zero energy density of the universe contribute to the lifting of flat directions. As a result, the scalar potential along $\phi$ can be written as~\cite{Dine95}:
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = \left(m^2_\phi + c_\H H^2 \right) {\vert \phi \vert}^2 +
\vert \lambda_n \vert^2 {{\vert \phi \vert}^{2(n-1)} \over \Lambda^{2(n-3)}} + \left[(A_n + a_n H) {\lambda_n \phi^n \over n \Lambda^{n-3}} + {\rm h.c.} \right]\, ,
\label{pot}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hubble expansion rate. The three terms on the right-hand side of (\ref{pot}) represent, respectively, the sum of the low energy and Hubble induced soft mass terms, the contribution of superpotential terms and the sum of the low-energy and Hubble induced $A$-terms. 

The role of $\phi$ in the early universe\footnote{SUSY flat directions and their cosmological consequences are discussed in detail  in~\cite{flat}.} crucially depends on the size and sign of $c_\H$: 
\vskip 2mm
\noindent
{\bf (1)} $c_\H \gtrsim 1$. In this case, $\phi$ has a mass that exceeds the Hubble expansion rate during inflation $H_{\rm inf}$. Then, due to fast rolling,
the field settles down to the origin of its potential during inflation, which bears no interesting consequences. 
\vskip 2mm
\noindent
{\bf (2)} $0 < c_\H \ll 1$. In this case $\phi$ makes a quantum jump of length $H_{\rm inf}/2\pi$ within
each Hubble time. These jumps superpose in random walk fashion, resulting in the following maximum displacement for $\phi$ during inflation~\cite{Linde}:
\begin{equation} 
\phi_{\rm max} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{8 \pi^2}} \frac{H^2_{\rm inf}}{m_\phi}\,.
\label{rms}
\end{equation}
\vskip 2mm
\noindent
{\bf (3)} $c_\H < 0$.\footnote{A negative $c_\H$ can arise at the tree-level~\cite{Dine95}, or from radiative corrections~\cite{gmo,adm}.} In this case $\phi$ becomes tachyonic during inflation. Hence it is driven away from the origin and quickly settles at the minimum of the potential that has a large VEV: 
\begin{equation} \label{tach}
\phi_{\rm inf} = \left({H_{\rm inf} \Lambda^{n-3} \over \sqrt{n-1} c_\H \lambda_n} \right)^{1/(n-2)}.
\end{equation}
After inflation $\phi$ follows an instantaneous value that slowly varies due to the expansion of the universe. Once $H \sim m_\phi$, low energy SUSY breaking terms take over the potential, see (\ref{pot}), and $\phi$ starts oscillating about the origin with an initial amplitude:
\begin{equation} \label{initial}
\phi_0 ~ \sim ~ \left({m_\phi \Lambda^{n-3} \over \sqrt{n-1} \lambda_n}\right)^{1/(n-2)}\, .
\end{equation}
The $\phi$ field also feels a torque due to the $A$-term in (\ref{pot}) that results in rotational motion~\cite{Dine95}. If $\phi$ has a non-zero baryon number $\beta$, rotation will result in a baryon asymmetry~\cite{Affleck:1984fy}. The asymmetry per $\phi$ quanta is given by~\cite{Dine95}:
\begin{equation} \label{asym}
{n_{\B} \over n_\phi} \sim \beta ~ {\rm sin} (n \theta_i) ~ {|A_n| \over m_\phi}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\theta_i$ is the initial angular displacement of $\phi$ from the minimum of the potential in the angular direction. This displacement could be due to a mismatch between the phases of $A$ and $a$, see (\ref{pot}), or a result of initial conditions along the angular direction (if $|a| \ll 1$). The comoving value of the generated baryon asymmetry remains constant at $H \ll m_\phi$ since the $A$-term is redshifted quickly by Hubble expansion. The asymmetry is transferred to fermions when $\phi$ decays and the final value of BAU $n_\B/s$ (with $s$ being the entropy density) depends on the details of the post-inflationary thermal history of the universe. We will give a detailed discussion on the generation of BAU in our model later on.      

\subsection{Supergravity constraints}
\label{ssec:currentcontraints}

The possibility to realise AD baryogenesis in a 4D $N=1$ supergravity theory has already been analysed in \cite{Casas:1997uk, Dutta:2010sg, Marsh:2011ud, Dutta:2012mw}. The requirement that D-flat directions develop a tachyonic mass during inflation but are non-tachyonic in the present vacuum sets strong constraints on the form of the K\"ahler metric. It has therefore been very difficult to build an explicit supergravity inflationary model where the AD field acquires a large VEV during inflation and relaxes at the origin at later times. 
In order to overcome these difficulties, let us first summarise the common assumptions behind the previous analyses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Hubble-induced mass of the AD field $\phi$ during inflation is determined by the F-term of just one field, the inflaton $\sigma$, which dominates the energy density;
\item The gravitino mass is never larger than the Hubble scale during inflation, i.e. $m_{3/2} \lesssim H_{\rm inf}$;
\item The contribution of the F-term of $\sigma$ to the scalar mass of $\phi$ is negligible after the end of inflation in order to avoid tachyons.
\end{enumerate}
Starting from these assumptions, a no-go theorem has been worked out in~\cite{Dutta:2012mw} stating that in the case with $m_{3/2}\ll H_{\rm inf}$ it is impossible to realise both inflation and AD baryogenesis if the holomorphic sectional curvature at a given point of the field space is constant for all choices of planes in the tangent space. Moreover, it has been found~\cite{Casas:1997uk, Dutta:2010sg, Marsh:2011ud} that $\phi$ cannot become tachyonic during inflation if the K\"ahler metric for matter fields $\tilde{K}$ scales exactly as $\tilde{K} = e^{K/3}$ where $K$ is the K\"ahler potential for the geometric moduli. 

In this paper we shall show how to construct an explicit model that can successfully accommodate inflation and AD baryogenesis by relaxing the previous assumptions as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Hubble-induced mass of $\phi$ during inflation is determined by the F-terms of several moduli and not just the inflaton $\sigma$;
\item The gravitino mass is larger than the Hubble scale during inflation, $m_{3/2} \gg H_{\rm inf}$, while low-energy SUSY is obtained since the visible sector is sequestered from the sources of SUSY breaking;
\item The F-term of $\sigma$ contributes to the mass of $\phi$ also after the end of inflation in a way compatible with $m_\phi^2>0$;
\item We consider cases where the relation $\tilde{K} = e^{K/3}$ is satisfied only at leading order while it is broken by subleading corrections.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sequestered Large Volume Scenario}
\label{SecSeqLVS}

\subsection{Setup of the compactification}
\label{sec:setup}

String compactifications always come with a number of energy scales which are dynamically determined by the theory in terms of a the single fundamental scale: the string length $\ell_s = M_s^{-1}$, where $M_s$ is the string scale. We denote the volume of the compact space $X$ by ${V}$ (measured in string units in 4D Einstein frame). The low-energy supergravity approximation holds when ${V} \gg 1$, producing the following hierarchy of scales:
\begin{equation}
M_\KK \simeq \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{4 \pi} {V}^{2/3}} \quad \ll \quad M_s = \frac{g_s^{1/4} M_p}{\sqrt{4 \pi {V}}} \quad \ll \quad M_p\,,
\end{equation}
where $M_\KK$ is the Kaluza-Klein scale, while $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $g_s$ is the string coupling constant. We are interested in the type IIB low-energy theory below $M_\KK$ which is characterised by the presence of many moduli: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The axio-dilaton $S$ whose real part $s$ determines the string coupling $g_s = \langle s \rangle^{-1}$.

\item $h^{1,2}$ complex structure moduli $U_\alpha$ which parameterise the shape of the internal space.

\item $h^{1,1}$ K\"ahler moduli $T_i$ whose real parts $\tau_i = \text{Re} (T_i) = \text{Vol} (D_i)$ give the size of the divisors $D_i$ of the compact space. The imaginary parts are instead axion-like fields $\psi_i = \text{Im} (T_i) = \int_{D_i} C_4$ where $C_4$ is the Ramond-Ramond 4-form.
\end{itemize}

We work in the framework of LVS models where the CY volume takes a typical Swiss-cheese form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:volume}
{V} = \tau_b^{3/2} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \tau_i^{3/2}\,.
\end{equation}
The overall volume ${V}$ is controlled by the size $\tau_b$ of a `big' divisor $D_b$. The internal space $X$ contains also $n$ `holes', the `small' divisors $D_i$, whose size is much smaller than that of $D_b$: $\tau_i \ll \tau_b$. String compactifications that we are going to discuss include O3/O7-planes and the following small cycles \cite{CYembedding, ModStabChir}:
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ divisors $D_i$, $i=1,...,n$, supporting non-perturbative effects and allowing moduli stabilisation \`a la LVS. As we shall explain in Sec.~\ref{ssec:KMI}, the modulus governing the size of the $n$-th divisor, $\tau_n = \text{Vol} (D_n)$, will play the r\^ole of the inflaton.

\item A couple of shrinkable divisors $D_a$ and $D_b$ which are exchanged by the orientifold involution. This results in a linear combination $D_+ = D_a + D_b$ which is even under the orientifold involution and a combination $D_- = D_a - D_b$ which is instead odd. $D_+$ is the cycle which hosts the visible sector and its size is denoted by $\tau_\SM = \text{Vol}(D_+)$, while $D_-$ gives rise to an additional K\"ahler modulus $G = \int_{D_-} B_2 + i \int_{D_-} C_2$, where $B_2$ and $C_2$ are respectively the Kalb-Ramond and the Ramond-Ramond 2-forms belonging to the massless spectrum of type IIB string theory. Both $D_+$ and $D_-$ shrink to zero size due to D-terms stabilisation, namely $\tau_\SM, \text{Re}(G) \rightarrow 0$, while the corresponding axions are eaten up by anomalous $U(1)$s \cite{CYembedding}. 
\end{itemize}

The low-energy effective field theory is an $N=1$ supergravity which is completely specified in terms of the real K\"ahler potential $K$, the holomorphic superpotential $W$ and the gauge kinetic functions $f_a$ ($a$ refers to different gauge groups). The K\"ahler potential reads (including the leading $\alpha'$ correction proportional to the constant $\hat\xi$ \cite{BBHL}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kahlerpotential}
K = - 2 \ln \left({V} + \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\right) - \ln (S + \overline{S}) + \frac{\tau_\SM^2}{{V}} + \frac{b^2}{{V}} + K_{\rm cs}(U) + K_{\rm matter} \,,
\end{equation}
where we defined $b \equiv \text{Re}(G)$ and $\hat\xi = \xi s^{3/2}$. $K_{\rm cs}(U)$ is the tree-level K\"ahler potential for the $U$-moduli and $K_{\rm matter}$ is the K\"ahler matter metric which includes the visible fields $C^\alpha$. It takes the generic form \cite{Blumenhagen:2009gk,Aparicio:2014wxa}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kahlermattermetric1}
K_{\rm matter} = \tilde{K}_\alpha(U,S,T) C^\alpha \overline{C}^{\overline{\alpha}} + Z(U,S,T) \left(H_u H_d + \text{h.c.}\right) \,.
\end{equation}
As we shall explain in Sec.~\ref{sssec:scalarmasses}, most of the results of the present paper depend on the exact form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$. Its leading order ${V}$-scaling can be easily inferred by a locality argument: since visible sector fields are localised at a singularity, the physical Yukawa couplings $\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ should not depend (at least at leading order) on the overall volume ${V}$ \cite{Conlon:2006tj}. They are related to the holomorphic Yukawas $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$ as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = e^{K/2} \frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\sqrt{\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma}} \,.
\end{equation}
Notice that at perturbative level $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)$ do not depend on the $T$-moduli due to the holomorphicity of $W$ and the perturbative shift-symmetry of the axions $\psi_i$. Requiring that $\hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ do not depend on ${V}$ implies that:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K}_\alpha = f_\alpha(U,S)\, e^{K/3} \,,
\label{eq:uldefinition}
\end{equation}
where $f_\alpha(U,S)$ is a generic flux-dependent function. We distinguish between two limits, along the lines of \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Ultra-local limit}:~\eqref{eq:uldefinition} holds at all orders in the ${V}$-expansion.

\item \textit{Local limit}:~\eqref{eq:uldefinition} holds only at leading order in the ${V}$-expansion.
\end{enumerate}
Given that the factor $e^{K/3}$ in (\ref{eq:uldefinition}) can be expanded as (for vanishing VEVs of $\tau_\SM$, $b$ and matter fields):
\begin{equation}
e^{K/3}  = \frac{e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2\,s)^{1/3}}\frac{1}{\left({V} + \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\right)^{2/3}} = 
\frac{e^{K_{\rm cs}/3}}{(2\,s)^{1/3}}\frac{1}{\hat{V}^{2/3}}\left(1+\frac 23 \frac{\tau_n^{3/2}}{\hat{V}} -\frac{\hat\xi}{3\hat{V}}+ \cdots\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{V} = \tau_b^{3/2} - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\tau_j^{3/2}$, the K\"ahler matter metric $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ can be parameterised as:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{K}_\alpha = \frac{f_\alpha(U,S)}{\hat{V}^{2/3}}\left(1- 2 c_n \,\frac{\tau_n^{3/2}}{\hat{V}} -c_\xi \frac{\hat\xi}{\hat{V}}+ \cdots\right)\,.
\end{equation}
The ultra-local limit defined above would then correspond to the case $c_\xi = - c_n = 1/3$.

The holomorphic superpotential is instead given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:superpotential}
W = W_0(U,S) + \sum_{i=1}^n A_i(U,S)\, e^{-a_i T_i} + W_\dS + W_{\rm matter}\,,
\end{equation}
where $W_0(U,S)$ is the flux-dependent tree-level superpotential \cite{Gukov:1999ya}:
\begin{equation}
W_0(U,S) = \int_X G_3 \wedge \Omega\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the holomorphic 3-form of $X$ while $G_3 = F_3 - S H_3$, with $F_3 = dC_2$ and $H_3 = dB_2$. $A_i(U,S)$, $i=1,...,n$, are ${O}(1)$ coefficients which depend on the $S$ and $U$-moduli.\footnote{From now on we will omit the $U$ and $S$ dependence in both $W_0$ and $A_i$.} For the coefficients $a_i$ we shall take $a_i = 2 \pi/N_i$ with $N_i \in \mathbb{N}$. Finally $W_\dS$ contains information about the dS sector, while $W_{\rm matter}$ depends on the matter fields $C^\alpha$ and looks like:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wmatter}
W_{\rm matter} = \mu(U,S,T) H_u H_d + Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S,T) C^\alpha C^\beta C^\gamma + \dots\,,
\end{equation}
where the dots indicate higher order terms in the expansion around the VEV of visible fields $\langle C^\alpha \rangle = 0$. $\mu$ is the $\mu$-term while $Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ are the holomorphic Yukawa couplings. 

The gauge kinetic function for the visible sector localised at the singularity $\tau_\SM \rightarrow 0$ depends uniquely on the dilaton:
\begin{equation}
f_a = \kappa_a S + \lambda_a T_\SM \rightarrow \kappa_a S \,,
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_a$ is a singularity-dependent coefficient. 

\subsubsection{Moduli stabilisation}
\label{ssec:modulistabilisation}

Due to the no-scale structure of theories defined by a K\"ahler potential as in~\eqref{eq:kahlerpotential}, at tree level the supergravity F-term scalar potential is positive definite and depends only on $S$ and $U^\alpha$. The global supersymmetric minimum of such a scalar potential is located at:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:susystabilisation}
D_S W_0 = 0 \,, \qquad D_{U^\alpha} W_0 = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
In LVS corrections due to $\alpha'$ effects in (\ref{eq:kahlerpotential}) and non-perturbative effects in (\ref{eq:superpotential}) are subleading with respect to (\ref{eq:susystabilisation}) in the large volume limit ${V} \gg 1$. Thus one can consistently first stabilise $S$ and $U^\alpha$ in a supersymmetric manner at order ${O}\left({V}^{-2}\right)$, and then fix the $T$-moduli by perturbing this solution with corrections at order ${O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$. This perturbation generates also a small shift in the minimum \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}: $D_S W \sim D_{U^\alpha} W \sim {O}\left({V}^{-1}\right)$ which is of fundamental importance to generate non-vanishing gaugino masses, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:soft-terms}. The low-energy F-term scalar potential of the LVS model described above takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LVSscalarpotential}
V_F = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left[\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(\frac{8}{3} (a_i A_i)^2 \sqrt{\tau_i} \,\frac{e^{-2 a_i \tau_i}}{{V}} -  4 a_i A_i W_0 \tau_i \,\frac{e^{-a_i \tau_i}}{{V}^2}\right) + \frac{3 \hat{\xi} |W_0|^2}{4 {V}^3}\right] + V_\dS \,,
\end{equation}
where $V_\dS$ is a term which depends on the details of the dS sector. Notice that the first two terms descend from the non-perturbative effects in~\eqref{eq:superpotential}. The axions $\psi_i$, $i=1,...,n$, are stabilised in such a way that the second term is negative. The last term in square brackets is due to $\alpha'$ corrections in~\eqref{eq:kahlerpotential}. $V_\dS$ is essential to achieve a Minkowski/dS vacuum $V_0 \equiv \langle V \rangle \simeq 0$. Two dS sectors consistent with sequestered compactifications were considered in \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item dS$_1$ case: \textit{de Sitter from hidden charged fields} \\ 
LVS string compactifications generically feature hidden sector D-brane stacks on the `big' divisor $D_b$ which support matter fields $\phi_\dS$ that are charged under a $U(1)$ symmetry \cite{CYembedding}. D-term stabilisation induces non-zero F-terms for these hidden sector fields which give rise to a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential, $V_\dS \sim W_0^2/{V}^{8/3}$, that can lead to Minkowski/dS vacua. From a higher-dimensional point of view, this corresponds to having a T-brane background \cite{Cicoli:2015ylx}.

\item dS$_2$ case: \textit{de Sitter from non-perturbative effects} \\ 
It is possible to have an additional shrinkable divisor $D_\dS$ on top of the O7-plane and supporting non-perturbative effects \cite{Cicoli:2012fh}. D-term stabilisation fixes the size of this divisor to $\tau_\dS = 0$,\footnote{Since $\tau_{\rm dS} \rightarrow 0$ the expression for the volume in~\eqref{eq:volume} is not affected by the new divisor $D_\dS$.} while a new term in the superpotential of the form $W_\dS = A_\dS \,e^{-a_\dS (S + \kappa_\dS T_\dS)}$ gives rise to a positive definite contribution to the F-term scalar potential with scaling $e^{-2 a_\dS \text{Re} (S)}/{V}$ which can lead to a Minkowski/dS vacuum.
\end{enumerate}

The position of the minimum for the scalar potential in (\ref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}) does not depend on the dS sector at leading order. It is given by the following relations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LVSminimum}
e^{-a_i \tau_i} \simeq  \frac{3 W_0 \sqrt{\tau_i}}{4 a_i A_i {V}}
 \, \qquad \text{and} \qquad \left(a_i\tau_i\right)^{3/2} \simeq \frac{\hat\xi}{2}\,\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{-3/2}} \quad\forall i=1,...,n\,.
\end{equation}
These relations clearly imply that at the minimum $a_i \tau_i \sim {O}\left(\ln {V}\right)$.

\subsubsection{F-terms}
\label{ssec:susybreaking}

SUSY-breaking is governed by F- and D-terms. However, in the setup of Sec.~\ref{sec:setup} D-terms are subdominant with respect to F-terms \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa} whose general expression in supergravity is: 
\begin{equation}
F^i = e^{K/2} K^{i \overline{j}} D_{\overline{j}} \overline{W} \,.
\end{equation}
Once supersymmetry is broken, the gravitino acquires a mass given by:
\begin{equation}
m_{3/2} = e^{K/2} |W| \simeq \frac{g_s^{1/2}}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi}} \frac{W_0 M_p}{{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
The major source of SUSY-breaking is the presence of background fluxes which generate a non-vanishing F-term for the field $\tau_b$ through a non-zero $W_0$. At leading order it does not depend on the dS sector and it is given by three terms which come from tree-level, $\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects:
\begin{equation}
F^{T_b} = F^{T_b}_{\rm tree} + F^{T_b}_{\alpha'} + F^{T_b}_{\rm np}\,,
\end{equation}
where (the axions have already been fixed at their minimum):
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^{T_b}_{\rm tree}}{m_{3/2}} = - 2 \tau_b\,,\qquad \frac{F^{T_b}_{\alpha'}}{m_{3/2}} = - \frac{3\tau_b}{2} \frac{\hat\xi}{{V}} \,,
\qquad \frac{F^{T_b}_{\rm np}}{m_{3/2}} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{4 A_i a_i \tau_i}{\sqrt{\tau_b}}\,\frac{{V}}{W_0}\,e^{-a_i\tau_i}\,.
\label{FTb}
\end{equation}
The minimisation condition (\ref{eq:LVSminimum}) implies that at the minimum: 
\begin{equation}
\langle F^{T_b}_{\rm np} \rangle = - \langle F^{T_b}_{\alpha'} \rangle + {O}\left( \frac{\tau_b \,\hat\xi\,m_{3/2}}{{V} \ln{V}}\right).
\label{relFTb}
\end{equation}
Thus at the minimum $F^{T_b}$ scales as: 
\begin{equation}
\langle F^{T_b} \rangle = - 2 \tau_b m_{3/2}\left[1+ {O}\left(\frac{\hat\xi}{{V} \ln{V}}\right)\right]\,.
\label{FTbmin}
\end{equation}
Similarly to $F^{T_b}$, the F-terms associated to the `small' divisors $D_i$ receive also three contributions:
\begin{equation}
F^{T_i} = F^{T_i}_{\rm tree} + F^{T_i}_{\alpha'} + F^{T_i}_{\rm np}\,,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\frac{F^{T_i}_{\rm tree}}{m_{3/2}} = - 2 \tau_i\,,\qquad \frac{F^{T_i}_{\alpha'}}{m_{3/2}} = - \frac{3\tau_i}{2} \frac{\hat\xi}{{V}} \,,
\qquad \frac{F^{T_i}_{\rm np}}{m_{3/2}} = \frac{8 A_i a_i \sqrt{\tau_i}}{3}\,\frac{{V}}{W_0}\,e^{-a_i\tau_i}\,.
\label{eq:smallfterms2}
\end{equation}
Using (\ref{eq:LVSminimum}) it turns out that at the minimum: 
\begin{equation}
\langle F^{T_i}_{\rm np} \rangle = - \langle F^{T_i}_{\rm tree} \rangle + {O}\left( \frac{\tau_i m_{3/2}}{\ln{V}}\right).
\label{relFTi}
\end{equation}
Hence at the minimum $F^{T_i}$ is determined by the first correction to $F^{T_i}_{\rm np}$ in the $\ln {V}$-expansion:
\begin{equation}
\langle F^{T_i}\rangle \simeq - \frac{3 m_{3/2}}{2 a_i} \,.
\label{FTimin}
\end{equation}
Moreover the scalar potential (\ref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}) can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
V = \sum_{I,J \in \{b,i\}} K_{I \overline{J}} F^I \overline{F}^{\overline{J}} - 3 m_{3/2}^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Due to the no-scale structure:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{I,J \in \{b,i\}} K^0_{I \overline{J}} F^I_{\rm tree} \overline{F}^{\overline{J}}_{\rm tree} - 3\,m_{3/2}^2 = 0\,,
\end{equation}
where $K^0_{I \overline{J}}$ is the tree-leve K\"ahler metric, the scalar potential (\ref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}) is generated by non-perturbative and $\alpha'$ corrections to the effective action. In detail, for each $i=1,...,n$, the three terms in square brackets in~\eqref{eq:LVSscalarpotential} are given by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{g_s (a_i A_i)^2 \sqrt{\tau_i}}{3 \pi} \frac{e^{-2 a_i \tau_i}}{{V}} = K^0_{T_i \overline{T}_i} F^{T_i}_{\rm np} \overline{F}^{\overline{T}_i}_{\rm np}$\,,

\item $- \frac{g_s (a_i A_i) W_0 \tau_i}{2 \pi} \frac{e^{-a_i \tau_i}}{{V}^2}= \left(K^0_{T_b \overline{T}_i} F^{T_b}_{\rm tree} + K^0_{T_i \overline{T}_i} F^{T_i}_{\rm tree} \right) \overline{F}^{\overline{T}_i}_{\rm np}+ K^0_{T_b \overline{T}_b} F^{T_b}_{\rm tree} \overline{F}^{\overline{T}_b}_{\rm np} + \text{h.c.}$\,,

\item $\frac{3 g_s}{32 \pi} \frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} = \left(K^0_{T_b \overline{T}_b} F^{T_b}_{\rm tree} \overline{F}^{\overline{T}_b}_{\alpha'} + \text{h.c.}\right) + K^{\alpha'}_{T_b \overline{T}_b} F^{T_b}_{\rm tree}\overline{F}^{\overline{T}_b}_{\rm tree}$\,,
\end{enumerate}
where $K^{\alpha'}_{T_b \overline{T}_b}$ is the leading order $\alpha'$ correction to the $T_b \overline{T}_b$ element of the K\"ahler metric.

Let us finally point out that the F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli are subleading relative to the others given that they are generated by the shift of their minimum induced by non-perturbative and $\alpha'$ corrections. This shift can be parameterised as in \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}:\footnote{We report here only the leading order term in the $\ln{V}$-expansion. Subleading corrections are nevertheless important for phenomenological applications, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:gauginomasses}.}
\begin{equation}
F^S = s \,\omega(U,S) \frac{\tau_i^{3/2} m_{3/2}}{{V}} \, \qquad \text{and} \qquad \, F^{U^{\alpha}} = \beta^\alpha(U,S) F^S \,,
\end{equation}
where $\omega(U,S)$ and $\beta^\alpha(U,S)$ are ${O}(1)$ flux-dependent coefficients which can be tuned to produce interesting phenomenological results. As we will see in Sec.~\ref{sssec:gauginomasses}, even if $F^S$ is ${V}$-suppressed, it plays a key r\^ole in the phenomenology of sequestered models.

\subsection{Soft-terms}
\label{sec:soft-terms}

In sequestered string compactifications the visible sector lives on D3-branes at singularities \cite{SingD3s, CYembedding}. Due to this particular D-brane configuration, in sequestered models gauge degrees of freedom living on D3-branes decouple from bulk fields. Furthermore, since SUSY is broken in the bulk, this decoupling results in a suppression of soft-terms with respect to the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. As we shall explain in Sec.~\ref{sec:dynamics}, due to this separation of scales, sequestering can help to get low-energy SUSY without any cosmological problem associated to light moduli \cite{CMP} or gravitino overproduction \cite{gravProbl}. The aim of this section is to summarise the pattern that the soft terms acquire in sequestered models, depending on the form of the K\"ahler matter metric $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ in~\eqref{eq:kahlermattermetric1}.

\subsubsection{Gaugino masses}
\label{sssec:gauginomasses}

Given that the gauge kinetic function for D3-branes at singularities depends on the dilaton $S$, gaugino masses are controlled by $F^S$ and look like: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gauginomasses}
M = \frac{F^S}{2s} \simeq \lambda(U,S) \frac{\hat\xi \,m_{3/2}}{{V}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda(U,S)$ is a flux-dependent function whose explicit expression depends on the dS sector and is given in \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}.

\subsubsection{Scalar masses}
\label{sssec:scalarmasses}

The situation is much more involved for scalar masses whose general expression, assuming a diagonal K\"ahler metric $\tilde{K}_{\alpha \overline{\beta}} = \tilde{K}_\alpha \delta_{\alpha \overline{\beta}}$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha^2 = m_{3/2}^2 + V_0 - F^I \overline{F}^{\bar{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\bar{J}} \ln \tilde{K}_\alpha + \tilde{K}_\alpha^{-1} \sum_a g_a^2 D_a \partial_\alpha \partial_{\overline{\alpha}} D_a \,.
\label{eq:scalarmassesgeneral}
\end{equation}
Non-zero D-term contributions can arise from hidden scalar fields $\phi_k$ living on D7-branes wrapped around the large 4-cycle $\tau_b$ which supports an anomalous $U(1)$ with $g_b^2 = \tau_b^{-1}$. These D-term contributions look like:
\begin{equation}
D_b = \sum_k Q_{k,b} \phi_k \frac{\partial K}{\partial \phi_k} + \sum_I q_{I,b} \partial_{T_I} K \,,
\end{equation}
where $Q_{k,b}$ and $q_{I,b}$ are, respectively, the $U(1)$ charge of the $k$-th hidden scalar and the $I$-th K\"ahler modulus under the $U(1)$ on $D_b$. 

In order to compute scalar masses, it is crucial to know the exact moduli dependence of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$. The leading order results are (see \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa} for the details of the computation):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Ultra-local limit} \\
Due to the form of $\tilde{K}_\alpha$ in~\eqref{eq:uldefinition}, the ${O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$ F-term contributions to scalar masses cancel off and the final result depends on the dS sector:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] dS$_1$ case: non-zero scalar masses are generated by D-term contributions at ${O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$ \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 \simeq \frac{9}{64} \frac{\hat\xi \,m_{3/2}^2}{{V}\ln{V}} \,,
\end{equation}
while the leading F-term contribution to $m_0^2$ is at ${O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$. In this case scalar masses are universal.

\item[b)] dS$_2$ case: D-term contributions are subleading with respect to ${O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$ contributions from F-terms of $S$ and $U$-moduli which give:
\begin{equation}
m_\alpha^2 \simeq Q_\alpha(U,S)\, M^2 \,,
\label{eq:scalarmassesdilaton}
\end{equation}
where $Q_\alpha(U,S)$ is a flux-dependent function involving derivatives of $f_\alpha (U,S)$. In this specific case scalar masses might not be universal.
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{Local limit} \\
In the local limit the effect of D-terms is negligible. We report the results for two limiting cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] \textit{$c_n = - 1/3$}:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 \simeq \frac{15}{4} \left(c_\xi - \frac 13\right) \frac{\hat\xi\, m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \,,
\label{Locala}
\end{equation}

\item[(b)] \textit{$c_\xi=0$}:
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 \simeq \frac{15}{4\,n} \left[c_n- \frac 13 \left(n-1\right)\right] \frac{\hat\xi\, m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \,,
\label{eq:scalarmassesinflaton}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
which implies that in the local limit scalar masses have to be universal. This result has been derived assuming, without loss of generality, $a_i=a$ $\forall i=1,...,n$, so that $\tau_i^{3/2} = \hat\xi /(2\,n)$.
\end{enumerate}

Vanishing leading order results for the scalar masses in the ultra-local limit can be recovered by setting $c_\xi=1/3$ in case (a) and $c_n= (n-1)/3$ in case (b). We stress that in case (b), given that $c_\xi=0$, an effective ultra-local limit can be obtained only at the minimum using the minimisation condition (\ref{eq:LVSminimum}). Notice that in all cases, except for the ultra-local dS$_1$ case, scalars can be either tachyonic or non-tachyonic, depending on $Q_{\alpha}(U,S)$, $c_n$ and $c_\xi$. Non-tachyonic scalars require $Q_\alpha(U,S)>0$ in the ultra-local dS$_2$ case and $c_\xi>1/3$ for case (a) and $c_n > (n-1)/3$ for case (b) of the local limit. 


\subsubsection{$A$-terms}
\label{sssec:aterms}

The scalar potential (\ref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}) contains cubic terms in the canonically normalised scalar fields ${\hat C}^\alpha$ of the form:\footnote{Higher-order superpotential terms that lift $\phi$ result in $A$-terms that are higher than cubic, corresponding to $n > 3$ in (\ref{pot}). Here we perform an explicit computation of the cubic $A$-terms. Calculations are more involved for higher order $A$-terms but the results are qualitatively similar.}   
\begin{equation}
V \supset \hat{Y}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \hat{C}^\alpha \hat{C}^\beta \hat{C}^\gamma\,,
\end{equation}
where $A_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ are functions of the moduli of the compactification. It turns out that D-term contributions to $A_{\alpha \beta \gamma}$ are subleading \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}, while the general F-term expression for the $A$-terms is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:generalaterms}
A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = F^i \partial_i \left[K + \ln\left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{\tilde{K}_\alpha \tilde{K}_\beta \tilde{K}_\gamma}\right)\right] \,.
\end{equation}
Writing the K\"ahler matter metric as $\tilde{K}_\alpha = f_\alpha \tilde{K}$, the general expression in~\eqref{eq:generalaterms} can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:simplifiedaterms}
A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = F^i \partial_i \left[K - 3 \ln \tilde{K} + \ln\left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
We study separately the different limits of the K\"ahler matter metric:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Ultra-local limit}: \\
From~\eqref{eq:simplifiedaterms} it is straightforward to see that there is a cancellation between the first two terms in square brackets. As a consequence the $A$-terms are determined by the F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli:
\begin{equation}
A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = \sum_{i = S, U} F^i \partial_i \left[\ln\left(\frac{Y_{\alpha \beta \gamma}(U,S)}{f_\alpha f_\beta f_\gamma}\right)\right] \equiv \frac{\Pi(U,S)}{{V}^2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Pi(U,S)$ is an ${O}(1)$ flux-dependent function.

\item \textit{Local limit}: \\
In this case the $A$-terms receive contributions also from the F-term of $T_b$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $c_n=-1/3$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:atermsdilaton}
A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = \frac 92 \left(c_\xi - \frac 13\right) \frac{\hat\xi\,m_{3/2}}{{V}} + \frac{\Pi(U,S)}{{V}^2} \,,
\end{equation}
where both terms have the same volume scaling.

\item[(b)] $c_\xi=0$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inflatonaterms}
A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} = \frac{9}{2\,n} \left[c_n- \frac 13 \left(n-1\right)\right]  \frac{\hat\xi\,m_{3/2}}{{V}} + \frac{\Pi(U,S)}{{V}^2}\,,
\end{equation}
where again both terms have the same volume scaling.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Summary of soft terms}
\label{sssec:summarysoftspectra}

Here we summarise the results of the last sections, noting that they can be divided in two classes depending on the form of the K\"ahler matter metric:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{MSSM-like spectrum}: in the ultra-local dS$_2$ case all soft terms have the same volume scaling:
\begin{equation}
M \sim m_\alpha \sim A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sim \frac{M_p}{{V}^2} \,.
\end{equation}
This is a typical MSSM-like spectrum with (possibly non-universal) scalars and gauginos at the same energy scale.

\item \textit{Split SUSY spectrum}: in the local and ultra-local dS$_1$ cases the volume scaling of gauginos and scalars is different:
\begin{equation}
M \sim A_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sim \frac{M_p}{{V}^2} \, \qquad \text{while} \qquad m_0 \sim \frac{M_p}{{V}^{3/2}} \,.
\end{equation}
Thus gauginos are lighter than scalars, featuring a splitting of the soft scales.
\end{enumerate}
Notice that in order to have TeV gaugino masses, the volume ${V}$ should be in the range $10^6$-$10^8$. In turn, in order for~\eqref{eq:LVSminimum} to be satisfied without the necessity to fine-tune the coefficients $A_i$, the following relation should be satisfied:
\begin{equation}
a_i \tau_i \simeq \ln\left(\frac{{V}}{W_0}\right) \qquad \quad\forall i =1,...,n\,,
\label{eq:finetuningcondition}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_i$ is given in terms of $g_s$ as in (\ref{eq:LVSminimum}). For typical values of $W_0$ in the range $1$-$100$ (\ref{eq:finetuningcondition}) implies that the ratio $a_i/g_s$ has to lie in the range $60$-$120$.\footnote{We will fix $\xi = 1$ and $n = 10$ to perform numerical calculations.}

\section{Inflation, reheating and Affleck-Dine baryogenesis}
\label{sec:dynamics}

As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:ADreview}, in order to examine the viability of AD baryogenesis, one needs to have an explicit model for SUSY breaking and inflation. Here we use the model proposed in \cite{Conlon:2005jm} to realise inflation since in this inflationary scenario the range of ${V}$ required to get the observed amplitude of density perturbations leads also to low-energy gauginos. 

\subsection{Inflationary dynamics}
\label{ssec:KMI}

The idea behind the model proposed in \cite{Conlon:2005jm} is very simple: the `small' modulus $\tau_n$ plays the r\^ole of the inflaton which experiences an exponentially flat direction when moved away from its minimum. The CY volume ${V}$ is instead kept almost fixed during inflation by the additional `small' moduli $\tau_j$, $j=1,...,n-1$ which sit at their minima. Therefore the total scalar potential (\ref{eq:LVSscalarpotential}) during inflation takes the simplified form: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inflationarypotential1}
V = \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \left[\sum_{j = 1}^{n-1} \left(\frac{8}{3} (a_j A_j)^2 \sqrt{\tau_j} \,\frac{e^{-2 a_j \tau_j}}{{V}} -  4 a_j A_j W_0 \tau_j \,\frac{e^{-a_j \tau_j}}{{V}^2}\right) + \frac{3 \hat{\xi} |W_0|^2}{4 {V}^3}\right] + V_\dS + \delta V (\tau_n ) \,.
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\delta V(\tau_n ) = - \frac{g_s}{2 \pi}\,a_n A_n W_0 \tau_n \frac{e^{-a_n \tau_n}}{{V}^2}\,.
\end{equation}
If all $\tau_j$, $j=1,...,n-1$ and ${V}$ are fixed at their minima during inflation, the potential in~\eqref{eq:inflationarypotential1} can be written as the sum of a constant $V_0$ and $\delta V (\tau_n )$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inflationarypotential2}
V_{\rm inf} = V_0 - \frac{g_s}{2 \pi}\,a_n A_n W_0 \tau_n \frac{e^{-a_n \tau_n}}{{V}^2} \,,
\end{equation} 
where a careful computation gives:
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{3}{4\,n} \frac{\hat\xi\, m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,.
\label{eq:v0}
\end{equation}
We stress that the minima of $\tau_j$, $j=1,...,n-1$ and ${V}$ during inflation are slightly shifted from their values after the end of inflation:
\begin{equation}
\left.\ln{V}\right|_{\rm inf} \underset{n\gg 1}{\simeq} \ln {V} \left(1+ \frac{2}{n}\right) \qquad\text{and}\qquad 
\left.\tau_j^{3/2}\right|_{\rm inf} \underset{n\gg 1}{\simeq} \tau_j^{3/2}\left( 1+\frac 3n\right).
\label{shift}
\end{equation}
Given that the canonically normalised inflaton $\sigma$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3 {V}}} \,\tau_n^{3/4}\,,
\label{eq:canonicallynormalizedinflaton}
\end{equation} 
the scalar potential for $\sigma$ takes the form:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm inf} = V_0 - c_1 \sigma^{4/3} e^{-c_2 \sigma^{4/3}}   \qquad\text{with}\quad c_1 = \frac{g_s}{2 \pi} \frac{A_n W_0}{{V}^2} c_2  \quad\text{and}\quad
c_2= a_n \left(\frac{3 {V}}{4}\right)^{2/3}\,.
\label{eq:inflationarypotential3}
\end{equation} 
It is much easier to express the slow-roll parameters in terms of the non-canonically normalised fields as:
\begin{eqnarray}
&\epsilon& \simeq \frac{512 \, n^2}{27} \frac{a_n^3 A_n \tau_n^{5/2}}{\hat{\xi}^2 W_0^2}\, {V}^3 \, e^{-2 a_n \tau_n}\,, \\
&\eta& \simeq -\frac{64 \, n}{9} \frac{a_n^3 A_n \tau_n^{3/2}}{\hat\xi W_0}\, {V}^2\,  e^{- a_n \tau_n}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
In order for inflation to take place, both $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ have to be much smaller than $1$. Just looking at the volume scaling, and since in the late-time minimum $a_n \tau_n \sim \ln {V}$, it is easy to infer that inflation can take place in the region:
\begin{equation}
a_n \tau_n \gtrsim 2 \ln {V}\,,
\end{equation}
and it ends at $\tau_n^{\rm end}$ when $\epsilon$ becomes of order $1$. Moreover we have been able to numerically compute the position of the inflaton $\tau_n^*$ corresponding to horizon exit:
\begin{equation}
N_e(\tau_n^*) \simeq \frac{9}{64 \, n} \frac{\hat\xi W_0}{a_n^2 A_n {V}^2} \int_{\tau_n^{\rm end}}^{\tau_n^*} \frac{e^{a_n \tau_n}}{\tau_n^{3/2}} \,d \tau_n \simeq 60\,,
\end{equation}
where $N_e$ denotes the number of e-foldings. Once $\tau_{\rm inf}^*$ is known, both the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ can be evaluated as:
\begin{equation}
r = 16 \epsilon(\tau_n^*) \qquad \text{and} \qquad n_s = 1 - 6 \epsilon(\tau_n^*) + 2 \eta(\tau_n^*) \,.
\end{equation}
Typical values are $n_s \simeq 0.967$ and $r \lesssim 10^{-10}$, reflecting the small-field nature of this inflationary model.
Finally, it is necessary to numerically evaluate the amplitude of density perturbations ${A}_{{R}}$ as a function of $\tau_n$, and to impose that it matches the measured value at $\tau_n^*$. This requirement translates into:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:COBE}
{A}^2_{{R}}(\tau_n^*) \simeq \frac{g_s}{8 \pi} \frac{3^4 \hat\xi^3 W_0^4}{4^6 n^3 \, a_n^4 A_n^2 (\tau_n^*)^{5/2}} \frac{e^{2 a_n \tau_n^*}}{{V}^6} \simeq 2.7 \times 10^{-7}\,.
\end{equation}
The numerical analysis proceeds as follows: we set $a_j=a_n$ and $A_j=A_n$ $\forall j=1,...,n-1$ and choose the values of $a_n$ and $g_s$ as explained around (\ref{eq:finetuningcondition}) in order to avoid a severe fine-tuning of $A_n$ due to the relation (\ref{eq:LVSminimum}). Then for different values of $W_0$ in the natural range $1$-$100$ we compute the value of the volume $\left.{V}\right|_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm COBE}$ which reproduces the measured amplitude of density perturbations using (\ref{eq:COBE}). In Tab.~\eqref{tab:tab1} we report the results for $a_n = 2 \pi$, $g_s = 0.06$ and $n = 10$.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
 & $W_0$ & $\left.\log_{10}\left({V}\right|_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm COBE}\right)$ & $A_n$\\

\caption{Values of the volume $\left.{V}\right|_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm COBE}$ which match the observed amplitude of density perturbations for different values of $W_0$ and $a_n = 2 \pi$, $g_s = 0.06$ and $n = 10$.}
\label{tab:tab1}
\end{table}


\subsection{Dynamics of the Affleck-Dine field}
\label{ssec:ADBdynamics}

The dynamics of the AD field $\phi$ is governed by the scalar potential (\ref{pot}). In order to determine whether $\phi$ can acquire a large VEV during inflation, we need to compute its soft mass and the corresponding $A$-term. Since $\phi$ is made of MSSM scalars, we can readily use the expressions derived in Sec.~\ref{sssec:scalarmasses} and Sec.~\ref{sssec:aterms}. In what follows, we shall analyse separately the MSSM-like and the split SUSY case. Below, we denote with $\tilde{x}$ the value of any quantity $x$ during inflation. 

\subsubsection{MSSM-like case}
\label{sssec:ADdynamicsMSSM}

As explained in Sec.~\ref{sssec:scalarmasses}, an MSSM-like spectrum arises in the ultra-local dS$_2$ case where D-terms are negligible. Using (\ref{eq:scalarmassesgeneral}) and $V_0 = |F|^2 - 3 m_{3/2}^2$, due to the ultra-local condition (\ref{eq:uldefinition}), the soft mass of $\phi$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{m}_\phi^2 = m_{3/2}^2 + V_0 - \frac{1}{3} K_{I\bar{J}} F^I \overline{F}^{\bar{J}} -  F^I \overline{F}^{\bar{J}} \partial_I \partial_{\bar{J}} \ln f_\alpha(U,S) = \frac 23 \,V_0 + Q_\alpha(U,S) \,M^2\,.
\end{equation}
Given that $V_0 \sim {O}\left({V}^{-3}\right)$ while $M^2\sim{O}\left({V}^{-4}\right)$, the leading order contribution to the soft mass of $\phi$ during inflation comes from the vacuum energy $V_0$: 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{m}^2_\phi \simeq \frac 23 V_0 =  \frac{1}{2\,n} \frac{\hat{\xi} m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \simeq 2 H^2_{\rm inf}> 0\,.
\label{mphiUL}
\end{equation}
This implies that in this case the AD field cannot acquire a tachyonic mass during inflation. Thus $\phi$ settles at the origin during inflation and remains there throughout the entire post-inflationary history. As a result, it cannot give rise to a successful AD baryogenesis. This is in agreement with similar results found in \cite{Casas:1997uk, Dutta:2010sg, Marsh:2011ud}.

\subsubsection{Split SUSY case}
\label{sssec:ADdynamicssplitsusy}

During inflation the inflaton $\tau_n$ is displaced from its late-time minimum. Therefore the inflaton-dependent contribution to $F^{T_b}_{\rm np}$ in (\ref{FTb}) and to $F^{T_n}_{\rm np}$ in (\ref{eq:smallfterms2}) can be neglected during inflation, leading to:
\begin{equation} 
\frac{\tilde{F}^{T_b}_{\rm np}}{m_{3/2}} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\frac{4 A_j a_j \tau_j}{\sqrt{\tau_b}}\,\frac{{V}}{W_0}\,e^{-a_j\tau_j}\,,
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\tilde{F}^{T_n}_{\rm np}}{m_{3/2}} = \frac{8 A_n a_n \sqrt{\tau_n}}{3}\,\frac{{V}}{W_0}\,e^{-a_n\tau_n}  \rightarrow 0\,.
\end{equation}
Thus the relations (\ref{relFTb}) and (\ref{relFTi}) for $i=n$, which were true at the minimum, do not hold anymore during inflation when the F-terms of $T_b$ and $T_n$ become:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}^{T_b} = -2\tau_b\,m_{3/2}\left(1+\frac{3}{4\,n} \frac{\hat\xi}{{V}}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}^{T_n} = \tilde{F}^{T_n}_{\rm tree} = - 2 \tau_n m_{3/2} \,.
\end{equation}
Given that both $F^{T_b}$ and $F^{T_n}$ have a different form during inflation compared with the one at the minimum (see (\ref{FTbmin}) and (\ref{FTimin}) for $i=n$ respectively), in the local case, which leads to split SUSY, the AD field can possibly develop a tachyonic mass during inflation. 
In order to investigate this possibility, we consider the two limiting cases studied before:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $c_n=-1/3$ \\
The scalar masses are determined by the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_b} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_b} \partial_{T_b} \partial_{\overline{T}_b} \ln\tilde{K}_\alpha = m_{3/2}^2 + \frac{5}{2} \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \,\tau_n^{3/2} - \frac{15}{4} \frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \left(c_\xi - \frac 13 -\frac{1}{15 n}\right)$\,,
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_n} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_b} \partial_{T_n} \partial_{\overline{T}_b} \ln\tilde{K}_\alpha 
       + \tilde{F}^{T_b} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_n} \partial_{T_b} \partial_{\overline{T}_n} \ln\tilde{K}_\alpha = -3 \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,\tau_n^{3/2}$\,,
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_n} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_n} \partial_{T_n} \partial_{\overline{T}_n} \ln\tilde{K}_\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,\tau_n^{3/2}$\,.
\end{enumerate}
Using the general expression for scalar masses (\ref{eq:scalarmassesgeneral}), we find that the contributions proportional to $\tau_n^{3/2}$ cancel off giving a soft mass of $\phi$ during inflation of the form:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{m}_\phi^2 = \frac{15}{4}\frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \left(c_\xi - \frac 13 + \frac{2}{15\,n}\right)\,.
\label{mphi}
\end{equation} 
Notice that this expression correctly reproduces the soft scalar mass at the minimum (\ref{Locala}) in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$, and the result (\ref{mphiUL}) in the ultra-local limit $c_\xi=1/3$. Moreover (\ref{mphi}) becomes negative if:
\begin{equation}
c_\xi < \frac 13 - \frac{2}{15\,n}\,.
\end{equation}
Given that this condition is in clear contrast with the requirement of non-tachyonic scalar masses after the end of inflation, i.e. $c_\xi > \frac 13$, we conclude that in this case it is not possible to obtain a tachyonic mass for the AD field during inflation.\footnote{The $A$-terms take the same form both during and after inflation.}


\item[(b)] $c_\xi=0$ \\
The scalar masses are determined by the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_b} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_b} \partial_{T_b} \partial_{\overline{T}_b} \tilde{K}_\alpha = m_{3/2}^2 - \frac{15}{2} c_n \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,\tau_n^{3/2} + \frac 54 \frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\left(1+\frac{1}{5\,n}\right)$\,,
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_n} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_b} \partial_{T_n} \partial_{\overline{T}_b} \tilde{K}_\alpha 
+\tilde{F}^{T_b} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_n} \partial_{T_b} \partial_{\overline{T}_n} \tilde{K}_\alpha= 9 c_n \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,\tau_n^{3/2}$\,,
\item $\tilde{F}^{T_n} \tilde{F}^{\overline{T}_n} \partial_{T_n} \partial_{\overline{T}_n} \tilde{K}_\alpha = -\frac 32 c_n \frac{m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,\tau_n^{3/2}$\,.
\end{enumerate}
Again the contributions proportional to $\tau_n^{3/2}$ cancel off in the general expression for scalar masses (\ref{eq:scalarmassesgeneral}), leading to a soft mass of $\phi$ during inflation of the form:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{m}_\phi^2 = - \frac 54 \frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \left(1-\frac{2}{5 n}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
which is always negative for $n>1$. Therefore the case with $c_\xi=0$ guarantees that the mass of the AD field becomes tachyonic during inflation for every value of $c_n$. On the other hand, as we have seen in Sec. \ref{sssec:scalarmasses}, if $c_n > (n-1)/3$, $m^2_\phi > 0$ after the end of inflation. Thus this case represents a good example where AD baryogenesis can be explicitly realised. We finally mention that also the $A$-terms get modified during inflation since they look like:
\begin{equation}
A = - \frac 32 \frac{\hat\xi m_{3/2}}{{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reheating from lightest modulus decay}

In order to understand how reheating takes place we need first to look at the moduli mass spectrum. The canonically normalised inflaton $\sigma$ is exponentially light during inflation but after inflation, when it oscillates around its minimum, it becomes very heavy:
\begin{equation}
m_\sigma \sim \frac{W_0 M_p}{{V}}\,\ln{V} \sim  m_{3/2}\,\ln{V}\,.
\label{msigma}
\end{equation}
Due to the local nature of this blow-up mode, $\sigma$ is coupled to the field theory living on this 4-cycle as $1/M_s \sim \sqrt{{V}}/M_p$, as opposed to a standard Planckian-strength coupling. It therefore decays relatively quickly leading to an initial reheating temperature of order \cite{Cicoli:2010ha}: 
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm rh,in} \sim \sqrt{\Gamma_{\sigma} M_p} \sim \frac{m_\sigma}{M_s} \sqrt{m_\sigma M_p} \sim \frac{M_p}{{V}}\,.
\label{Trhin}
\end{equation}
If $\tau_n$ supports a hidden sector, when $\sigma$ decays, the inflaton will dump most of its energy to hidden sector degrees of freedom. This is not necessarily a problem since these hidden degrees of freedom get diluted by the decay of the lightest modulus. On the other hand, one has to check that the reheating temperature due to the decay of the inflaton does not give rise to thermal effects which destabilise the zero-temperature minimum. In LVS models this requires \cite{Anguelova:2009ht}:
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm rh,in} < T_{\rm max} \sim \frac{M_p}{{V}^{3/4}}\,,
\end{equation}
which is safely satisfied for ${V} \gg 1$ by the reheating temperature given in (\ref{Trhin}).

As shown in (\ref{shift}), during inflation all the blow-up modes $\tau_j$, $j=1,...,n-1$ get shifted from their late-time minimum. However they have a mass of order (\ref{msigma}) which makes them heavier than the inflationary Hubble scale given in (\ref{eq:v0}) since:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{ m_{\sigma_j}}{H_{\rm inf}}\right)^2 \sim \frac{{V}}{\sqrt{\ln{V}}} \gg 1\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, after the end of inflation, these fields quickly relax to their late-time minimum and do not play any relevant r\^ole for the post-inflationary evolution. 

The situation is completely different for $\tau_b$ which is the lightest modulus. In fact, the canonically normalised `big' modulus $\chi$ acquires a mass whose exact form depends on the way to achieve a dS vacuum \cite{Aparicio:2014wxa}: 
\begin{equation}
{\rm dS}_1: \quad m_\chi^2 \simeq \frac{9}{16 a_n \tau_n} \frac{\hat\xi \,m_{3/2}^2}{{V}}\,, \qquad \qquad 
{\rm dS}_2: \quad m_\chi^2 \simeq \frac{27}{8 a_n \tau_n} \frac{\hat\xi\, m_{3/2}^2}{{V}} \,,
\label{eq:volumemass}
\end{equation}
implying that $\chi$ has a mass of order $H$ during inflation. Moreover, as shown in (\ref{shift}), $\chi$ gets a displacement in Planck units during inflation of order:
\begin{equation}
\chi = \sqrt{\frac 23}\ln{V}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \Delta\chi = \chi_{\rm inf} -\chi \underset{n\gg 1}{\simeq} \frac{2\chi}{n} =
\frac{2}{n} \sqrt{\frac 23}\ln{V} \sim {O}(1)\,.
\end{equation}
Thus right after inflation $\chi$ starts oscillating around its minimum with an initial amplitude of order $M_p$. Being only gravitationally coupled to other fields, $\chi$ decays very late when it dominates the energy density of the universe, leading to dilution of any previously produced relic abundance and a final reheating temperature \cite{DMDRcorr}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:treheatingmod}
T_{\rm rh} \simeq \frac{0.3}{g_*^{1/4} \sqrt{\Delta N_{\rm eff}}}\,m_\chi\sqrt{\frac{m_\chi}{M_p}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $g_*$ is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at reheating while $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ is the amount of extra axionic dark radiation produced from the decay of the lightest modulus \cite{Cicoli:2012aq,Cicoli:2015bpq}. For $g_*\sim 100$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq 0.5$,\footnote{The actual prediction for axionic dark radiation is model-dependent: in MSSM-like scenarios the main visible sector decay channel for $\chi$ is into Higgses, while in split SUSY models $\phi$ can also decay into squarks and sleptons. For details, see \cite{Cicoli:2012aq,Cicoli:2015bpq}.} and using the numbers in Tab. \ref{tab:tab1}, we find $m_\chi \sim 10^{8}-10^{9}$ GeV and $T_{\rm rh}\sim 10^{3}-10^{4}$ GeV. This value of $T_{\rm rh}$ is larger than BBN temperatures of order $1$ MeV, and so this model does not suffer from any cosmological moduli problem \cite{CMP}. Moreover, since $m_\chi/m_{3/2} \sim {V}^{-1/2} \ll 1$, the decay of the lightest modulus into gravitinos is kinematically forbidden, implying the absence of moduli-induced gravitino problem \cite{gravProbl}.


\subsection{Generation of baryon asymmetry}
\label{ssec:baryonasymmetry}

We now compute the baryon asymmetry of the universe generated via the AD mechanism in our model. As mentioned earlier, the decay of the lightest modulus $\chi$ reheats the universe at late times and dilutes the entropy produced from the decay of the inflaton $\sigma$. We are therefore interested in deriving the ratio $n_\B/s$, where $n_\B$ is the baryon number density stored in the AD field and $s$ is the entropy density produced by the decay of $\chi$. The decay of $\phi$ takes place when its VEV is redshifted to a sufficiently low value such that $y |\phi| < m_\phi$ ($y$ being a gauge or Yukawa coupling), at which point the decay of $\phi$ to the fields that are coupled to it and acquire an induced mass $y |\phi|$, is kinematically allowed. We have checked that even for $\phi_0 \sim M_p$, the decay of the AD field occurs well before the decay of $\chi$, and hence any entropy that it may produce will be diluted by the decay of $\chi$. 

Let us focus on the split SUSY case where the AD field can acquire a tachyonic mass during inflation. In this case, $m_\phi \sim m_\chi \sqrt{\ln{V}} > m_\chi\sim  H_{\rm inf}$, implying that both $\phi$ and $\chi$ start oscillating straight after the end of inflation when the AD field makes a very rapid transition from the tachyonic to the non-tachyonic regime.\footnote{In cases where $m_\phi \ll H_{\rm inf}$, thermal effects from inflaton decay may lead to early oscillations of the AD field~\cite{thermal}. However, this is not an important effect in our model.} Hence, at the onset of $\chi$ oscillations, i.e. at $H \sim H_{\rm inf}$, we have:          
\begin{equation} \label{ratio2}
{n_\phi \over n_\chi} \simeq {m_\phi \over m_\chi} \left({\phi_0 \over M_p}\right)^2\,, 
\end{equation}
where we have used $n_\chi \simeq m_\chi M^2_p$ and $n_\phi \simeq m_\phi \phi^2_0$. 
The BAU generated via the AD mechanism is then given by:
\begin{equation} 
{n_\B \over s} =  {n_\B \over n_\phi} {n_\phi \over n_\chi} {n_\chi \over s} ,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
{n_\chi \over s} = {3 T_{\rm rh} \over 4 m_\chi}\,,
\end{equation}
is the yield from $\chi$ decay and $T_{\rm rh}$ is the reheating temperature of the universe after $\chi$ decay. After using the expression (\ref{asym}), and for $n \theta_i \sim {O}(1)$, we arrive at the final result for baryon asymmetry (see also \cite{Kane:2011ih} for a similar result):
\begin{equation} \label{bau1}
{n_\B \over s} \sim {|A| \over m_\chi} {T_{\rm rh} \over m_\chi} \left({\phi_0 \over M_p}\right)^2\,.
\end{equation}

\section{Results and discussion}
\label{SecResults}

\subsection{Numerical results}
\label{sssec:numericalresults}

In this Section, we numerically analyse the parameters of the model so that the following requirements are satisfied: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] A successful model with around $60$ e-foldings of inflation that creates density perturbations of the correct size with
all underlying parameters in their natural range;

\item[b)] Low-energy gauginos which are well motivated by gauge coupling unification;

\item[c)] A correct generation of the observed BAU, $n_\B/s \simeq 10^{-10}$, via the AD mechanism.
\end{itemize}

Requirement $a)$ has already been studied in Sec. \ref{ssec:KMI}. For concreteness, we consider the points in the parameter space listed in Tab. \ref{tab:tab1}. Scalar masses are completely determined by requirement $a)$ since, as we have shown in (\ref{sssec:scalarmasses}), they depend only on $W_0$ and ${V}$ once the string coupling constant has been fixed. On the contrary, requirement $b)$ can be easily fulfilled using the additional freedom of gaugino masses: the possibility to vary $\lambda(U,S)$ in (\ref{eq:gauginomasses}) by tuning background fluxes. In particular we require that $M = 5 \times 10^3 \, \rm GeV$ when $W_0 = 100$ and the value of the volume is the corresponding $\left.{V}\right|_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm COBE}$ in case $(C)$ of Tab. \ref{tab:tab1}. In order for requirement $c)$ to be fulfilled, it is necessary to find the exact value of the AD field displacement $\phi_0/M_p$ such that the baryon asymmetry estimated in (\ref{bau1}) matches the measured value. We focus on the split SUSY case where late-time scalars are non-tachyonic while the AD field during inflation becomes tachyonic. Moreover we assume that the A-terms are determined solely by the first term in (\ref{eq:atermsdilaton}). We stress that these choices do not affect the qualitative behaviour of our final results. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:plot1} we illustrate the correlation between the produced baryon asymmetry and the gaugino masses in the split SUSY case. For the sake of concreteness we choose to work in the dS$_1$ scenario but the results are not dramatically affected by changing the dS sector. Differently coloured bands in Fig.~\ref{fig:plot1} correspond to different ranges for the reheating temperature. The dotted black lines correspond to constant values of $W_0$ in the natural range: $1, 10, 100$ from left to right. The continuous blue line corresponds to the locus where the amplitude of the density perturbations matches the measured value. It intersects the dotted black lines in the blue dots which respectively correspond to the cases $(A), (B), (C)$ in Tab. \ref{tab:tab1}. In Tab.~\ref{tab:tab2} we report the values of scalar masses, which are around $10^{9-10}$ GeV, the reheating temperature, which is larger than $100$ GeV, and the displacement of the AD field. Notice that it is possible to satisfy the requirements $a)$, $b)$ and $c)$ for natural ${O}(1)$ values of the parameter $A_n$ and for $\phi_0 \sim 0.1\,M_p$. Moreover $T_{\rm rh}$ shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:tab2} and given in~(\ref{eq:treheatingmod}) is completely determined by the requirement of getting the right amplitude of density perturbations.

\end{table}


\subsection{Origin of dark matter abundance}

In order to determine whether the DM relic abundance has a thermal or non-thermal origin, we have to compare $T_{\rm rh}$ with the DM freeze-out temperature $T_{\rm f} \sim m_\DM/20$. If $T_{\rm rh} \, > \, T_{\rm f}$, the DM content is set by thermal freeze-out while, for $T_{\rm rh} \, < \, T_{\rm f}$, the DM abundance is produced non-thermally from the decay of the lightest modulus. Since the lowest reheating temperature that is compatible with successful inflation and baryogenesis is $T_{\rm rh} \, \simeq \, 195$ GeV, the non-thermal mechanism requires $m_\DM \, > \, 3.9$ TeV. Due to the gravity-mediated pattern of gaugino masses, the lightest gaugino is the Bino, and hence the DM candidate in our model is either a Bino- or a Higgsino-like neutralino. Binos typically have a small annihilation rate, $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle \, < \, 3 \times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, especially for a split SUSY spectrum because of the extremely heavy sparticles. For Higgsinos with a mass above $\simeq 1.2$ TeV, we also have $\langle \sigma_{\rm ann} v \rangle \, < \, 3 \times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$.

Because of the smallness of the annihilation rate, non-thermal DM production must proceed through the `Branching' scenario where the correct relic abundance is produced directly from the decay of the lightest modulus~\cite{NonThDMinSeqLVS}. In this scenario, the DM abundance is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{prodabun}
\left({n_\DM \over s}\right)_{\rm non-th} = {3 T_{\rm rh} \over 4 m_\chi} ~ {\rm Br}_\DM \,,
\end{equation}
where ${\rm Br}_\DM$ is the branching ratio for producing $R$-parity odd particles (which eventually decay to the DM particle) from modulus decay. Even allowing for ${\rm Br}_\DM \sim 10^{-3}$, which is the smallest value allowed in this scenario~\cite{ADS}, and after using the values in Tab. \ref{tab:tab2}, we find that the `Branching' scenario would lead to DM overproduction by few orders of magnitude above the observed value: 
\begin{equation} \label{obsabun}
\left({n_\DM \over s}\right)_{\rm obs} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-10} ~ \left({1 ~ {\rm GeV} \over m_\DM}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
This implies that non-thermal DM is not compatible with inflation and baryogenesis in this model. We are therefore forced to consider thermal Higgsino DM with $m_\DM \simeq 1.2$ TeV where thermal freeze-out can produce the right DM abundance. For $m_\DM < 1.2$ TeV, the Higgsino is thermally underproduced, and so we need to consider mixed DM, as in the axion-Higgsino scenario~\cite{Howie}.                

Regarding the production of dark radiation, it has recently been shown \cite{Cicoli:2015bpq} that split SUSY models arising in sequestered string compactifications do not feature any overproduction. This is due to the large suppression of the excess of the effective neutrino number $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ coming from the decay of $\chi$ into MSSM scalars, which is allowed in a vast region of the parameter space.

Finally we would like to comment on obtaining a large VEV for the AD field and possible implications for the DM content of the universe. It is seen in Tab. \ref{tab:tab2} that the generation of the observed BAU needs $m_\phi \sim 10^9$-$10^{10}$ GeV and $\phi_0 \sim 0.1$ $M_p$. It is possible to get $\phi_0$ in this ballpark, see~(\ref{initial}), if the AD field is lifted by a non-renormalisable term of level $n = 9$ where $\lambda_9 \sim 1$.\footnote{In fact, all of the MSSM flat directions are lifted at this level if the superpotential includes all higher-order terms that are compatible with gauge symmetry~\cite{gkm}.} In this case, depending on the Higgsino mass, one can have either Higgsino or mixed DM scenario as mentioned above. 

One may also obtain the required value of $\phi_0$ if the AD field is lifted by a renormalisable term with $n = 3$. However, in this case, a very small coupling $\lambda_3 \sim 10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ is needed. This is much smaller than all of the SM Yukawa couplings, but it may arise from renormalisable superpotential terms that violate $R$-parity (namely $LLE$, $UDD$, $QLD$ terms). Such terms destabilise the Higgsino, and a question is whether this can lead to a cosmologically consistent scenario. To answer this, let us consider the situation in the presence of the $LLE$ term. In this case, the Higgsino can decay to three leptons via an off-shell slepton. The decay rate is $\Gamma_{\tilde H} \sim (\lambda_3 y_l)^2 m^5_{\tilde H}/(8 \pi \cdot 32 \pi^2) m^4_{\tilde l}$, where $y_l$ is a leptonic Yukawa coupling, $m_{\tilde H}$ and $m_{\tilde l}$ denote the Higgsino and slepton masses respectively, and the factor of $32 \pi^2$ arises due to the three-body final state. For $\lambda_3 \sim 10^{-7}$, $y_l \sim 10^{-2}$, $m_{\tilde l} \sim 10^{10}$ GeV, and $m_{\tilde H} \lesssim 200$ GeV, we may find a decay lifetime $\tau_{\tilde H} \gtrsim 10^{27}$ sec. This is compatible with the tightest cosmological bounds on decaying DM from the cosmic microwave background~\cite{slatyer}. The DM content of the universe can be explained within a mixed scenario where the Higgsino is the sub-dominant component.                

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Concl}

In this paper, we have presented a successful embedding of AD baryogenesis in type IIB sequestered string models. AD baryogenesis is a suitable mechanism for generating the observed BAU at temperatures below the EW scale. Such relatively low temperatures typically arise from the late-time decay of long-lived moduli in string compactifications. However, an explicit embedding of AD baryogenesis in such models is non-trivial as supergravity corrections can ruin the flatness of the AD field that is essential for the success of the AD mechanism.

The model presented here is in the context of LVS models and describes the cosmological evolution of the universe from inflation to the final stage of reheating by the decay of the volume modulus. Inflation is driven by a blow-up mode and generating density perturbations of the correct size requires gaugino masses within the range $M \sim 10^4$-$10^5$ GeV. The crucial point is that if the K\"ahler metric of the matter fields has a suitable dependence on the inflaton, sleptons and squarks in split SUSY models can become tachyonic during inflation, while being non-tachyonic in the post-inflationary era. In consequence, the AD field can develop a large VEV during inflation and its subsequent motion can lead to the generation of a baryon asymmetry that survives the dilution due to entropy release in the final stage of reheating driven by the decay of the lightest modulus. The final reheating temperature is sufficiently high to allow thermal Higgsino-like DM with a mass around $1$ TeV.

\label{app:axions}
\subsubsection*{A brief review of the QCD axion}
An axion-like particle (axion, for short) is a pseudoscalar particle $\phi$ that enjoys a continuous perturbative shift-symmetry of the form
\begin{equation}
\phi \rightarrow \phi + a	\,,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a real constant. Historically, axions arose in field theory to solve the long-standing strong-CP problem of QCD~\cite{Crewther:1979pi}. The symmetries of QCD allow for a topological term in the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} \supset \frac{\theta}{32 \pi^2} \text{tr} F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
where $F_{\mu \nu}$ is the QCD field strength. Such a term violates the CP symmetry and would give rise to an electric dipole moment for the neutron in contrast with observations, unless the parameter $\theta$ is tuned very small $\lesssim 10^{-10}$\cite{Baker:2006ts}.\footnote{The physical quantity is $\theta_{\text{phys}} = \theta + \text{arg} \left(\text{det} \left(M_u M_d\right)\right)$, where $M_u$ and $M_d$ are the quark mass matrices. The shift comes from a chiral rotation of quark fields in the Standard Model Lagrangian.} The introduction of an axion $\phi$, proposed by Peccei and Quinn~\cite{Peccei:1977hh, Wilczek:1977pj, Weinberg:1977ma}, solves this naturalness problem of QCD. The field $\phi$ couples with the topological term $\left(\phi/f\right) \, F \tilde F$, giving rise to an effective $\theta$ parameter
\begin{equation}
\theta_{\text{eff}} = \theta_{\text{phys}} + \frac{\phi}{f}\,,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the axion decay constant. Due to the shift-symmetry of the theory, $\theta_{\text{phys}}$ can be absorbed into the axion field. The shift-symmetry is broken by non-perturbative effects~\cite{Vafa:1984xg} (instantons in the case of QCD) to a discrete shift symmetry of the form
\begin{equation}
\phi \rightarrow \phi + 2 \pi f\,,
\end{equation}
and a cosine-like potential for the axion is generated
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:axionpotential}
V(\phi) = m_u \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^3 \left[1 - \cos \left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right)\right]\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ is the QCD scale and $m_u$ is the mass of the \textit{up} quark. Such a potential dynamically sets the coefficient of the topological term to zero. This procedure is very generic: non-perturbative effects always induce cosine-like potentials for axions. A coupling $\phi \, F \tilde F$ between the axion and the topological term is also allowed for Abelian gauge groups, i.e.~such a term is generically not forbidden by any symmetries. This is the basis for the coupling between the axion and Maxwell theory considered in this paper.

An axionic field with a coupling of the form $\phi \, F \tilde F$ is often associated with theories exhibiting global chiral or gauge anomalies. In the case of a gauge anomaly the axion is eaten by the gauge boson, giving rise to a consistent effective theory with a massive gauge boson. As a result the axion is removed from the low energy spectrum. This can be avoided in more complicated constructions with multiple U(1) factors and a carefully chosen fermion spectrum \cite{0605225}: In particular, one can construct theories with massless gauge bosons that couple to axions as $\phi \, F \tilde F$. 

\subsubsection*{Axions as inflaton fields}

Due to their perturbative shift-symmetry, axions are one of the most natural candidates to drive inflation: such a symmetry protects the flatness of their scalar potential against quantum corrections. The arguably simplest axion inflation model employs the cosine potential~\eqref{eq:axionpotential}.\footnote{The inflationary potential is obtained from eq. \eqref{eq:axionpotential} substituting $m_u \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^3 \rightarrow \Lambda^4$, where $\Lambda$ is the scale of non-perturbative effects that generate the potential for the inflaton, i.e.~$V = \Lambda^4 \left[1 - \cos\left(\phi/f\right)\right]$.} Note that inflation models based on such an oscillatory potential are models of large-field inflation: the slow-roll conditions are satisfied for $\phi \gtrsim m_p$. As the potential is periodic, this implies that the period needs to take super-Planckian values, i.e.~natural inflation requires $f \gtrsim m_p$. 

More general inflationary potentials can only be generated if the shift-symmetry is broken completely. If the breaking is explicit, the protection from quantum corrections would generically be lost. However, we can retain a sufficient level of control by only breaking the shift-symmetry weakly: note that it is technically natural to take the symmetry-breaking terms  to be small. Then the quantum corrections resulting from the breaking are also suppressed. Another way of preserving the protection offered by the shift-symmetry is to only break it spontaneously. This can be realized by coupling the axion to a 3-form theory~\cite{0507215, 0811.1989, 1101.0026}. To be explicit, consider the theory of an axion $\phi$ and a 3-form $C_{\nu \rho \sigma}$ with corresponding field strength $F_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} = 4 \partial_{[ \mu} C_{\nu \rho \sigma]}$ described by the following Lagrangian density:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{48} F_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}^2 + \frac{\mu}{24} \phi \, \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} F_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} \, .
\end{equation}
Here $\mu$ is a parameter with the dimensions of mass. As a 3-form does not have any propagating degrees of freedom in 4 dimensions, it can be integrated out, leading to
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} (q+\mu \phi)^2 \, ,
\end{equation}
where the parameter $q$ corresponds to a VEV for $F_4$~\cite{0811.1989}. Thus one arrives at a non-periodic potential for the axion of the form $V= \tfrac{1}{2}(q+\mu \phi)^2$. The discrete shift symmetry is still intact as a shift in $\phi$ is accompanied by a shift in $q$:
\begin{equation}
\phi \rightarrow \phi + 2 \pi f \, , \qquad q \rightarrow q - 2 \pi \mu f \, .
\end{equation}
However, the symmetry is broken spontaneously once a minimum $\phi = - q / \mu$ is chosen. As $q$ is quantized and takes discrete values one finds a family of potentials of the form $V= \tfrac{1}{2}(q+\mu \phi)^2$, one for each possible value of $q$.\footnote{The existence of a family of potentials introduces the danger that the axion may tunnel to another branch of the family rather than perform slow-roll on one branch.} The model still profits from a protection from large quantum corrections: the symmetry implies that corrections to $V$ can only come in the form of powers of $V/\Lambda^4$ with $\Lambda$ the UV cutoff.   

Above we saw how this approach can give rise to a quadratic axion potential. This method can also be used to realize more complicated axion potentials~\cite{0507215}. In particular, by modifying the 3-form kinetic term as
\begin{equation}
- \frac{1}{48} F_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}^2 \rightarrow -\frac{M^4}{24} \mathcal{G} \left(\frac{\epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}F_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}}{M^2} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
for some function $\mathcal{G}(x)$ and a scale $M$, one arrives at an axion potential
\begin{equation}
V = M^2 \int \textrm{d} \phi \, (\mathcal{G}')^{-1}\left(\frac{q-\mu \phi}{M^2} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $(\mathcal{G}')^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $\mathcal{G}'$.

So far we have discussed how theories of axions with various potentials can be constructed in field theory. For our purposes we also want to consider axion theories that -- in Einstein frame -- exhibit a non-canonical kinetic term. As we had not included gravity in our discussions of axions yet, there was no need to consider non-canonical kinetic terms, as one could always normalize. However, we will return to the question of non-canonical kinetic terms in the next sections, when we consider axions in supergravity and string theory. 

While considering axions as inflatons helps overcome many UV problems of inflation in effective field theory, one cannot remain completely agnostic about UV physics. For example, natural inflation needs $f \gtrsim m_p$, which seems to be an unnatural feature in the context of quantum gravity~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006dz, 0605206, Conlon:2012tz}. Hence, in the following we will describe how axions and their properties can arise when the UV physics is given by string theory. As string theory models of axion inflation are typically formulated in the effective supergravity theory arising from string theory compactifications, we turn to axions in supergravity next.

\subsubsection*{Axions in supergravity}
Axions can be very naturally embedded in supergravity. They can be described by either the phase or the real or imaginary parts of complex scalar fields in supermultiplets. Consider for example a theory of a chiral superfield $\Phi$ described by:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K} \equiv \mathcal{K}\left(\Phi + \overline{\Phi}\right)\,, \quad W \equiv W_0 = \textrm{const} \, .
\end{equation}
As $\mathcal{K}$ only depends on the combination $(\Phi + \overline{\Phi})$ and $W$ is independent of $\Phi$, the theory is symmetric under continuous shifts of $\textrm{Im}(\Phi)$, which we identify with the axion: $\phi \equiv \textrm{Im}(\Phi)$. 

To generate a potential for the axion, the shift symmetry has to be broken. This can occur due to non-perturbative effects as in the non-supersymmetric case. To this end we introduce a non-Abelian gauge sector with its corresponding field strength superfield $\mathcal{W}^{\alpha}$. If we choose the corresponding gauge kinetic function to be $f=\Phi$, the axion $\phi$ will couple to the topological term of the non-Abelian gauge theory:
\begin{equation}
\label{gaugekin}
{\left. \left( \Phi \ \text{tr} \, \mathcal{W}_{\alpha} \mathcal{W}^{\alpha} + \textrm{h.c.} \right) \right|}_{F} \supset  -\phi \ \text{tr} \, F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu}  \, .
\end{equation}
Then non-perturbative effects will introduce a periodic (Einstein-frame) potential for $\phi$ while at the same time breaking the continuous shift symmetry down to a discrete one. 

In this paper we are also interested in the coupling between the axion and the topological term of an Abelian gauge theory. This will arise from a coupling of type~\eqref{gaugekin} where $\mathcal{W}^{\alpha}$ is now the field strength superfield of the Abelian gauge theory.  

One can generate more general (i.e.~non-peridiodic) potentials for $\phi$ if the chiral superfield $\Phi$ appears in the superpotential explicitly, e.g.~$W = m h (\Phi)$ where $h$ is a holomorphic function. Then the shift symmetry of the axion is broken explicitly by $W$ (see however~\cite{0811.1989, 1101.0026}) and one may generate a polynomial Einstein-frame potential $V_E$. As $\mathcal{K}$ is still shift-symmetric, some of the axionic protections are still active. In particular, the breaking of the shift-symmetry is completely controlled by the parameter $m$. This is the ansatz for inflation models realizing $F$-term axion monodromy inflation~\cite{1404.3040, 1404.3542, 1404.3711}.

For our purposes we are particularly interested in theories where the axion kinetic term depends non-trivially on the axion itself. Given a K\"ahler potential $\mathcal{K}$ the function $K(\phi)$ appearing in~\eqref{non_minimal:einstein_frame} is given by $K \equiv \partial_{\Phi} \partial_{\overline{\Phi}} \mathcal{K}$. We can then make the following observation. If $\mathcal{K}$ preserves the axionic shift-symmetry, it only depends on the combination $(~\Phi~+~\overline{\Phi}~)$ and the function $K$ will only depend on the saxion $\textrm{Re}(\Phi)$, but not on the axion $\phi = \textrm{Im}(\Phi)$. Hence it seems that in supergravity we cannot get any non-trivial axion-dependence in $K$, without breaking the axionic shift-symmetry in $\mathcal{K}$.\footnote{This finding holds for all axions, i.e.~also for axions arising as phases or the real parts of complex scalars in chiral superfields. As long as $\mathcal{K}$ does not depend on the axion as required by shift-symmetry, there cannot be any axion-dependence in $K$.} 

It is possible to break the shift-symmetry in the K\"ahler potential in different ways. One possibility is to introduce an explicit breaking term as in~\cite{Ferrara:2010yw,Ferrara:2010in,Buchmuller:2012ex}. In such a case, in order not to lose all the advantages deriving from the shift-symmetry, the amount of breaking has to be small. In particular, we can always include further fields in the theory. Hence, a possibility is to break the shift-symmetry through loop effects, as for example for theories whose superpotential $W \supset \kappa \Phi S_+ S_-$~\cite{Gaillard:1993es,Stewart:1996ey,Stewart:1997wg}, where $S_\pm$ are heavy fields. Upon integrating out $S_{\pm}$, axion-dependent loop corrections modify the \Kahler potential. The amount of shift-symmetry breaking is naturally small because loop-suppressed. 

Furthermore, it is important to observe that in supergravity we can never get a theory of just an axion. As the axion arises from a complex scalar, there will at least always be the saxion partner as an additional field. If we consider effective supergravity theories from string theory, the existence of further fields is rather generic. Note that these generically introduce an explicit axion-dependence in the axion kinetic term through backreaction. 

Finally, note that in the Peccei-Quinn mechanism the axion arises from a phase of a complex field, whereas here we focused on axions corresponding to the imaginary part of a complex scalar: $\phi= \text{Im}(\Phi)$. However, both descriptions are related. If the real part of a complex scalar is a scalar, then calling the imaginary part or the phase a pseudoscalar is equivalent (in both cases, a complex conjugation corresponds to a change in sign in the pseudoscalar part). An explicit connection between the two cases can be made as follows. In particular, let
\begin{equation}
f= \Phi \equiv \sigma + i \phi \, ,
\end{equation}
with $\phi$ an axion and $\sigma$ denoting the scalar component (saxion). Then we can define
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\textrm{PQ}} = e^{f} = e^{i \phi} (\cosh \sigma + \sinh \sigma) \, ,
\end{equation}
such that the axion now appears as a phase.
Hence the descriptions of an axion as a phase vs.~the imaginary part are equivalent descriptions related by a non-linear map.

\subsubsection*{Axions from String Theory and Quantum Gravity Constraints}

Axions are also a very natural prediction of string theory. They arise from the dimensional reduction of form field gauge potentials on sub-manifolds of the string theory compactification space. The shift-symmetry in the four-dimensional effective field theory is a remnant of the gauge symmetry of gauge fields in the ten-dimensional theory. In addition there are also universal axions (the axionic part of the axio-dilaton and the axions from dualizing to 2-form gauge potentials (see e.g.~\cite{1404.2601} for a brief review). It is even expected that string theory compactifications may give rise to a \textit{string axiverse}~\cite{Arvanitaki:2009fg, Cicoli:2012sz}. 

There has been a sustained effort in the string theory community to embed inflation in string theory. Due to issues of theoretical control, models of inflation are typically constructed in a regime where an effective field theory description is applicable, rather than working in string theory directly. In particular, models are typically realized in the effective supergravity theory. There exists a multitude of proposed models of inflation in string theory (for a review until 2014 see~\cite{1404.2601}, for subsequent progress and references until September 2014 see~\cite{1409.5350}). However, most models come with open questions regarding control of quantum corrections, such that it is difficult to make robust predictions.

However, there are certain properties which appear to be universal as far as embedding axion inflation in string theory is concerned. In particular, axions with a super-Planckian period ($f > m_p$) seem to be inconsistent with string theory compactifications~\cite{0605206}. This implies that the simplest models of natural inflation cannot arise from string theory. This is also consistent with general quantum gravity arguments~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006dz, Conlon:2012tz}.

This does not imply that axion inflation in general is forbidden in string theory. However, to evade the constraints on the axion field range, models have to become more involved. The following mechanisms have been proposed to allow for inflation despite the constraint on the axion period:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Alignment mechanisms}~\cite{Kim:2004rp}. The idea is to create a long super-Planckian inflaton trajectory in the field space of two or more sub-Planckian axions. It is necessary to tune the potential~\cite{Kim:2004rp} or to rely on kinetic terms~\cite{1404.7496, Shiu:2015xda} to create this long trajectory within a compact sub-Planckian field space. 
\item \textit{N-flation}~\cite{Dimopoulos:2005ac, Cicoli:2014sva, Das:2014gua}: This approach exploits the fact that a diagonal direction in the field space of $N$ axions can be super-Planckian for sufficiently large $N$, even if every single axion has a sub-Planckian field range.
\item \textit{Axion monodromy}~\cite{Silverstein:2008sg, 0808.0706}: These models make use of an explicit breaking of the shift-symmetry (e.g.~due the presence of branes) in the spirit of~\cite{0507215, 0811.1989, 1101.0026} to generate a perturbative non-periodic potential for the axion. The originally periodic axion field space is effectively unfolded. 
\end{itemize}
String theory compactifications contain all necessary `ingredients' for a successful embedding of any one of the above approaches: the existence of multiple axions is rather generic and D-branes and fluxes give rise to monodromies. Consequently, there exist many proposed models based on these ideas (see e.g.\cite{1409.5350} for a review until Sep.~2014). Yet, there are many open questions regarding the viability of any one model of axion inflation from string theory. Generalizations of the Weak Gravity Conjecture pose serious constraints on models based on alignment or N-flation~\cite{1503.00795, 1506.03447}. At the same time there are persistent problems with control as far as the stabilization of additional scalar fields (moduli) is concerned. Overall, at the time of writing there is no final verdict regarding axion inflation from string theory: While string theory exhibits many properties for successful axion inflation, there does not yet exist a model that withstands deeper scrutiny.\footnote{Models of axion inflation are typically models of large-field inflation which will give rise to measurable tensor modes. However, measurable tensor modes can also be generated in stringy inflation models that do not employ axions~\cite{Cicoli:2008gp, Burgess:2016owb, Cicoli:2016chb}. For such inflationary models explicit string theory embeddings have been built, including a controlled moduli stabilization procedure and the presence of a chiral visible sector~\cite{Cicoli:2016xae, ChiralGlobalFibre}.}

What does this imply for the models of axion inflation considered in this work? In this paper we explore models that -- in Einstein frame -- exhibit a range of axion potentials, but also have non-canonical kinetic terms for the axion that depend on the axion itself. In addition, the axion should couple to the topological term associated with Abelian gauge theories. Overall, we find that string theory exhibits all the properties to accommodate the axion inflation models discussed in this work -- at least in principle. 
\begin{itemize}
\item As far as the potential is concerned, models of axion inflation in string theory were shown to give rise to a wide range of possible potentials. The possibilities increase further once back-reaction of other scalar fields (moduli) is taken into account~\cite{1011.4521,1405.3652}. 
\item As the existence of moduli is a generic feature of string theory compactifications, back-reaction effects will typically play a role. As described in the section on supergravity, back-reaction effects can also induce axion-dependence of the kinetic terms. 
\item Furthermore, couplings between axions and the topological terms of (non-)Abelian gauge theories is generic in string theory. These couplings are a crucial ingredient for the cancellation of gauge anomalies in consistent string vacuums via the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism.\footnote{In this case the gauge bosons receive string scale masses.} Interestingly, couplings of the form $\phi F \tilde{F}$ can also arise if the gauge theory is non-anomalous (see e.g.~\cite{0906.1920}).
\end{itemize}
However, to make any more precise statements would require the construction of an explicit string embedding, which is beyond the scope of this paper. We hence leave this for future work.
